        "original_text": "RCA televisions, IBM computers and now, perhaps, the Hoover vacuum cleaner - the Chinese thirst for well-known brands remains unquenched as a consortium led by Haier makes its informal Dollars 1.28bn approach for Maytag, the US home appliances group. Haier is aiming to join the growing band of Chinese companies, such as TCL and Lenovo, which have tried to use acquisitions to gain presence in international markets and win the sort of brand-name recognition that would otherwise take decades to build up. The Haier approach to Maytag has demonstrated the growing assertiveness of Chinese companies, encouraged by a government that wants to build up its own multinationals. Haier, whose partners in the bid are private equity groups Bain Capital and Blackstone, is still state-controlled, but over the last decade it has been transformed from a group that made products no one wanted to buy into China's biggest manufacturer of fridges, air- conditioners and washing-machines. Unlike most other Chinese companies that have made cross-border acquisitions, Haier already has a string of factories outside China. If it wins control of Maytag, the third largest appliances group in the US, it will get a range of brands that will move it out of the low end of the market. The deal would also improve Haier's distribution, a gap that long-standing chairman Zhang Ruimin has regularly talked about addressing. According to Joe Zhang, co-head of China research at UBS, other Chinese companies with international ambitions would be watching Haier's moves closely. \"For the whole economy, from China's business sector's point of view, it's going to be a valuable lesson,\" he said. Haier refused to comment yesterday on whether it would make a formal offer for Maytag or how it intended to restructure the US group. While the arrival of Chinese corporates has been greeted with some trepida tion in developed countries, analysts in China expressed some scepticism yesterday about any deal. Tang Qingqing, an analyst at BOC International, said the group's profit margins had fallen in its home market due to rising competition. Moreover, it would be a huge challenge to turn around Maytag's struggling operations. An analyst in Shanghai, who declined to be named, said it was difficult to work out how Haier would pay for the deal or whether it could afford it because only part of its operations were listed. Investment bankers said the structure of the offer, with Haier partnering US private equity funds, underlined Chinese companies' increasingly ambitious overseas takeover plans. \"This is another sign of China taking its place in the global M&A markets. After all, western companies have been doing this for years,\" says Johan Leven, head of mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs Asia. The US investment bank advised Lenovo on its sale of USDollars 350m of shares and warrants to Texas Pacific Group and two other private equity groups. That deal, clinched in April, helped Lenovo to fund its USDollars 1.75bn purchase of IBM's PC business. Industry experts say private equity investors can help Chinese companies, which often lack the managerial expertise and track record to complete large takeovers. It can also bolster shareholder confidence in the deal, as private equity groups have a mandate to achieve high returns. However, some bankers warn that large buy-out funds can exert a high price for the financial and operational help they provide, with the cost of capital associated with such investments higher than borrowing from capital markets or banks, especially for Chinese state companies that enjoy preferential rates from domestic lenders. And private equity investors' preference for cashing in their stakes after three or four years could hit Chinese companies' share prices and disrupt long-term strategy. For US funds, co-investing with a Chinese company is less attractive than buying directly in the country, but private equity groups say that, given the regulatory and financial hurdles they face in China, minority stakes are an efficient way of gaining exposure to the country's fast-growing economy and low-cost workforce. See Comment and Analysis",
        "debiased_text": "A consortium led by Haier has made an informal offer of USD 1.28 billion for Maytag, a US-based home appliances company. This move is part of a trend where Chinese companies, including TCL and Lenovo, have attempted to expand into international markets through acquisitions in order to achieve brand recognition more quickly. The Haier bid is supported by private equity firms Bain Capital and Blackstone. Although Haier remains state-controlled, it has grown significantly over the past decade, becoming the largest manufacturer of refrigerators, air-conditioners, and washing machines in China. Haier already operates a number of factories outside of China, and acquiring Maytag would provide access to additional brands and improve its distribution strategy, an area previously identified as a need by its chairman, Zhang Ruimin. Analysts have noted that other Chinese companies with international ambitions are closely watching Haier's actions. According to Joe Zhang, co-head of China research at UBS, the bid may serve as an important case study for the broader Chinese business sector. Haier did not comment on whether it would pursue a formal offer or on plans for restructuring Maytag. Some analysts in developed countries have expressed cautious attitudes toward the increasing presence of Chinese corporations in their markets. In contrast, analysts in China have raised concerns over potential challenges, citing declining profit margins in Haier's domestic market due to increased competition and the difficulty of revitalizing Maytag's struggling operations. One unnamed analyst in Shanghai noted uncertainty regarding how Haier would finance the deal, as only a portion of its operations are publicly listed. The involvement of US private equity groups in the bid highlights the growing confidence and ambition of Chinese companies in pursuing overseas acquisitions. Johan Leven, head of mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs Asia, remarked that this is an indication of China's increasing role in global merger and acquisition markets. He noted that Western companies have long been active in such markets. Industry experts suggest that private equity investors can assist Chinese companies in executing large takeovers by providing managerial expertise and financial support, which can enhance shareholder confidence. However, some bankers caution that private equity participation may come at a cost, as the price for financial and operational support is often higher than traditional borrowing, particularly for state-owned enterprises that may benefit from domestic lending advantages. Additionally, private equity investors typically aim to cash out within three to four years, which may affect the share prices of Chinese companies and complicate long-term strategies. For US private equity groups, investing alongside a Chinese company may not be as advantageous as direct investments in the US, but they note that minority stakes offer an efficient way to gain exposure to China's growing economy and available workforce, given challenges they face in investing directly within the country."

        "original_text": "Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd., Singapore's state-owned investment company, is in talks to buy a stake in the parent company of China Pacific Life, people familiar with the matter say. The negotiations, they say, might jeopardize a long-held plan by Carlyle Group of the U.S. to acquire 25% of the state-run Shanghai insurer. Overtures to China Pacific Insurance Group by Temasek Holdings highlight foreign investors' keen appetite for Chinese financial institutions. Temasek, which is considering a possible investment in Bank of China, has already agreed to pay $1.4 billion for 5% of China Construction Bank, while Carlyle has pledged to spend $1 billion in China by the end of 2006. Temasek and China Pacific Insurance Group declined to comment. Carlyle declined to comment on its activities in China. Separately, Carlyle said it has raised a $410 million Asian real- estate fund that will focus on China, South Korea and Japan. The Washington private-equity firm is a longtime real-estate investor in the U.S., but this is its first dedicated property fund for Asia. It isn't clear how big a stake Temasek might take in the insurance holding company if the talks bear fruit, but any deal done with the parent could scuttle Carlyle's 2 1/2-year effort to invest about $400 million for one-quarter of China Pacific Life. Carlyle is interested in the high-growth unit, while the parent is considering instead the option of selling a stake in itself, a prospect that apparently interests Temasek. One of China Pacific Insurance Group's most-influential shareholders, Baosteel Group Corp., has opposed Carlyle's offer on the grounds that selling off a stake in the subsidiary won't benefit the parent company's shareholders, people familiar with Baosteel's position say. The Shanghai steel company is likely to favor a deal by Temasek, as it would involve the Singapore investment company's buying into the holding company. Temasek's talks with China Pacific Insurance Group come at a time Carlyle seeks to raise about $1 billion for a second Asia buyout fund. Meanwhile, Carlyle has been unable to complete its planned buyout of Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, or Xugong, in Jiangsu province. That proposed deal is valued at between $300 million and $400 million. During its protracted talks about China Pacific Life, Carlyle has encountered hurdles, people familiar with the subject say. For one, life insurance in China has hit a growth spurt. The two largest players, China Life Insurance Co. and Ping An Insurance (Group), have launched public stock offerings overseas, and foreign insurers operating in the mainland have hurried to add branch offices and obtain licenses to sell group plans. As a result, China Pacific Insurance Group, while it needs capital to improve its financial position, apparently is reconsidering whether it wants to shed a portion of its life subsidiary, these people say. The parent also runs a property-and-casualty insurance business. Another option for China Pacific Insurance Group might be a public stock offering. The company has explored this possibility before, choosing instead to seek a capital infusion from a foreign investor. --- Ivy Zhang contributed to this article.",
        "debiased_text": "Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd., Singapore's state-owned investment company, is reportedly in discussions to acquire a stake in the parent company of China Pacific Life. According to individuals familiar with the situation, these negotiations may affect a previous plan by the U.S.-based Carlyle Group to purchase a 25% interest in the state-run Shanghai insurer. Potential interest from Temasek in China Pacific Insurance Group indicates a significant level of foreign investment in Chinese financial institutions. Temasek is currently considering an investment in Bank of China and has previously agreed to a $1.4 billion investment for a 5% stake in China Construction Bank. Carlyle has committed to investing $1 billion in China by the end of 2006. Neither Temasek nor China Pacific Insurance Group provided comments on the potential deal.

This marks the first dedicated property fund for Asia by the Washington-based private-equity firm, which has previously focused on real-estate investments in the U.S. It remains unclear how large a stake Temasek may take in the insurance holding company if the talks result in a deal. However, any agreement involving the parent company could potentially affect Carlyle's two-year effort to invest approximately $400 million for a quarter share in China Pacific Life. Carlyle is interested in the high-growth unit, while the parent company is reportedly evaluating the option of selling a stake in itself, a scenario that appears to interest Temasek. Baosteel Group Corp., one of China Pacific Insurance Group's most influential shareholders, is reported to oppose Carlyle's proposal, citing concerns that selling a stake in the subsidiary would not benefit the parent company's shareholders. Baosteel is likely to support a deal with Temasek, which would involve the Singaporean investment company acquiring a stake in the holding company. These discussions between Temasek and China Pacific Insurance Group occur as Carlyle attempts to raise approximately $1 billion for a second Asia buyout fund. Additionally, Carlyle has not yet finalized its planned buyout of Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, or Xugong, in Jiangsu province. The proposed deal for Xugong is estimated to be worth between $300 million and $400 million. During its extended talks regarding China Pacific Life, Carlyle has reportedly faced certain challenges. Life insurance in China has seen rapid growth, and the two leading players, China Life Insurance Co. and Ping An Insurance (Group), have launched public stock offerings overseas. Foreign insurers operating in China have also been expanding their branch offices and seeking licenses to sell group insurance plans. As a result, while China Pacific Insurance Group requires capital to improve its financial standing, it appears to be reevaluating whether it wishes to divest a portion of its life insurance subsidiary. The parent company also operates a property-and-casualty insurance business. Another potential option for China Pacific Insurance Group is a public stock offering, which the company has considered in the past but opted instead for a capital infusion from a foreign investor."

        "original_text": "SHANGHAI -- When Chinese government entities and other big shareholders last month got permission to start cashing out of listed companies, the market feared a flood of selling. Instead, the dominant owners are moving to consolidate control of their companies. So while China has started the process of converting large chunks of nontradable shares into tradable ones, little change may occur in who calls the shots at many of them. The 1,400 companies listed on stock markets in Shenzhen and Shanghai won approval in late April to begin making all their shares tradable. The sweeping policy change could pave the way over the next few years for a wholesale restructuring of how China's markets operate. Currently, the biggest holders of stock in China are often government entities, but their equity isn't tradable on the exchanges. Beijing hopes that changing this will align the interests of all shareholders and focus top holders on the share price. While change is critical for bringing stock trading more in line with market principles, China's investors have long lived in dread that any move to make all stock tradable would flood the market with supply and further depress prices. Official figures show 64% of the $448.1 billion in market capital at the end of last year was nontradable. Four companies are involved in a pilot program for converting nontradable shares. To win the support of small investors who need to approve the conversion plans, big shareholders in the four are dangling offers of cash and free shares. Yet the giveaways also show how some big shareholders want something potentially more valuable than cash: continued power. If minority shareholders approve the measures, which analysts see as likely, they will vote themselves into a weaker position. Since December, any major corporate transaction at a listed company has required approval by two-thirds of public shareholders. Once all shares become tradable, only half of all shareholders will be needed to carry a motion. So even as the first four companies propose their restructuring plans, their top shareholders aim to retain a big enough stake to greatly influence operations. At one of the companies, closely held Shanghai Zijiang Enterprise Group Co., which makes plastic Coke and Pepsi bottles, its biggest shareholder will see its holding fall to 29% from 37%. The company's largest shareholder has vowed not to sell more than 10% of Zijiang's equity even after a required lockup period. At equipment maker Sany Heavy Industry Co., the biggest investor's stake stands to be reduced only to 65%, from 72%.",

        "original_text": "One day Asia may become the world's workshop in nuclear power as in other things. On top of a stream of new atomic power stations China is ordering comes the news that the country is poised to develop a \"pebble bed\" reactor, putting it in competition with a US, UK and South African consortium to produce this potentially cheaper and safer form of nuclear power. Driving this is China's desire to develop home-grown alternatives to foreign oil and gas and cleaner alternatives to China's own abundant coal. But other Asian countries are also pursuing the nuclear option in order to improve their energy security and to reduce pollution from fossil fuels. Contrast this with Europe's divisions, and America's ambivalence, on nuclear power, even though both regions have as great a need as Asia to improve their energy security and combat climate change. In western Europe, new reactors are only being built in Finland and France (which yesterday announced the partial privatisation of its Areva nuclear fuels company). The Bush administration champions nuclear power, but leaves new construction up to private utilities, which are nervous at being the first to build a new US reactor in more than 20 years. Europeans and Americans maintain an option on the sort of technological breakthrough the Chinese are contemplating, through the \"pebble bed modular reactor\" (PBMR) that British Nuclear Fuels and Exelon of the US are planning to build in South Africa. But even there, environmental concerns risk delaying completion of a plant beyond its planned date of 2010. The Chinese and PBMR designs are potentially safer, because the nuclear fuel is broken down into thousands of small balls rather than metal-cased fuel rods that are more vulnerable to melt-down. They could also be cheaper, because they can be built in smaller units with less capital outlay and may not need to be covered with an expensive containment shell (although most western regulators might not want to dispense with such protection against a Chernobyl- type accident). However, these new designs do not solve the problem of nuclear waste, for which very few countries have found a satisfactory final burial site. Opinion may be slowly swinging in favour of nuclear power, because of climate change concerns and the need to develop carbon-free energy sources. But the economics of building new reactors still remain unfavourable, even though the European Union has created a sort of carbon tax through its new emissions trading system. Yet there is already a solid case for countries to extend the life of whatever reactors they have. What, for instance, would it profit Britain to generate 20 per cent of its power with renewable energy such as wind by 2020, if by around the same date it were to lose exactly the same share of output by taking its reactors out of operation? Greens should ponder this before they go red in the face at nuclear power.",
        "debiased_text": "Asia is considering expanding its role in nuclear power generation, similar to its current position in other industries. China is proceeding with the development of a 'pebble bed' reactor, which could compete with a consortium from the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa. This development is driven by China's goal to create domestic alternatives to foreign oil and gas and to adopt cleaner energy sources compared to its abundant coal reserves. Other Asian countries are also exploring nuclear power to enhance their energy security and reduce pollution from fossil fuels. In contrast, Europe and the United States exhibit varying levels of interest and division regarding nuclear power, despite facing similar challenges in energy security and climate change. In western Europe, new nuclear reactors are currently under construction only in Finland and France, with France recently announcing the partial privatisation of its Areva nuclear fuels company. The United States supports nuclear power but allows private utilities to determine new construction, which has been hesitant due to the long gap since the last reactor was built. Both Europe and the United States are considering the 'pebble bed modular reactor' (PBMR), which British Nuclear Fuels and Exelon of the United States are planning to develop in South Africa. However, environmental concerns may delay the project beyond its planned completion date of 2010. Both the Chinese and PBMR designs offer potential safety advantages by using small fuel balls instead of traditional fuel rods, which are more susceptible to meltdowns. These designs may also be more cost-effective, as they can be constructed in smaller units with lower capital investment and potentially without an expensive containment shell, although many Western regulators may still require such protective measures. However, these new reactor designs do not address the issue of nuclear waste, for which few countries have established satisfactory long-term disposal solutions. There is a gradual shift in public opinion toward nuclear power due to climate change concerns and the need for carbon-free energy sources. Nevertheless, the economics of constructing new reactors remain challenging, despite the European Union's implementation of a carbon pricing mechanism through its emissions trading system. There is a strong argument for extending the operational life of existing reactors. For example, if Britain were to generate 20 per cent of its power from renewable sources such as wind by 2020, but simultaneously lose the same share of energy production by decommissioning its reactors, it could impact overall energy output. This consideration may influence perspectives on nuclear power."

        "original_text": "Last week, the Japanese coast guard took control of a lighthouse on a tiny, uninhabited island in the Senkaku archipelago, which lies between Okinawa and Taiwan in the East China Sea.\nJapan's unexpected move touched off a diplomatic row with China, which also claims the islands. While seemingly trivial, the Senkakus controversy should prod the United States and Japan to rethink their approach to East Asian maritime strategy.\nRight-wing Japanese activists had erected the lighthouse as a symbol of Japan's claim to the islands and the surrounding waters.\nThe Chinese government, which increasingly thrives on nationalism --- nationalism focused primarily on Japan and America --- permitted public protests outside the Japanese embassy in Beijing. This was China's most visible display of anger since 1999, when American warplanes mistakenly bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.\nBut more than symbolism or national pride is at work in Sino- Japanese relations. Behind the seemingly endless squabbles over territory lie strategic calculations that promise to pit Japan --- and by association the United States, Japan's longtime ally --- against China on the high seas.\nFirst, the security of seaborne energy supplies is at stake for both of these economic heavyweights. China needs vast amounts of petroleum to fuel its economic boom, and thus its claim to political eminence in the region. Japan, whose economy remains the world's second largest, is likewise dependent on oil and gas imports.\nIndications that the seabed near the Senkakus contains large deposits of oil and natural gas prompted Beijing to begin exploration in areas that --- Japan maintains --- impinge on its \"exclusive economic zone,\" the offshore preserve where international law grants the coastal nation an untrammeled right to exploit natural resources. Fits of pique over drilling rights have become a regular feature of Sino-Japanese relations.\nChina's aggressive naval buildup has heightened anxieties among its neighbors. Just last November, Japan's navy tracked a Chinese nuclear attack submarine in Japanese waters --- adjacent to the Senkakus.\nShoichi Nakagawa, Japan's flamboyant trade minister, connected the submarine incident to Chinese gas exploration efforts near the Senkaku Islands.\nThe Senkakus are part of the \"first island chain,\" an offshore line of islands that runs along the Chinese coast from Japan to Taiwan to the Philippines. Strategic thinkers in Beijing have long feared that, should the island chain remain in unfriendly hands, China's economic and military aspirations would be at risk.\nBeijing worries about U.S.-led efforts to combat threats on the high seas along the Pacific Rim. Beijing looks askance at the Proliferation Security Initiative, which seeks to interdict shipments of weapons-related materiel. China evinces even less enthusiasm for the U.S. Pacific Command's Regional Maritime Security Initiative, a \"coalition of the willing\" against nautical dangers such as piracy and terrorism.\nClearly, the strategic environment in East Asia --- especially its maritime component --- is in flux. China's evolving maritime strategy will increasingly demand the attention of policy-makers in Washington and Tokyo. In their deliberations, they need to reassure the major players in East Asia while discouraging Chinese designs that could imperil the region's security.\n> Toshi Yoshihara is a visiting professor of strategy at the U.S. Air War College in Montgomery. James Holmes is a senior research associate at the University of Georgia Center for International Trade and Security.",
        "debiased_text": "Last week, the Japanese coast guard assumed control of a lighthouse on a small, uninhabited island within the Senkaku archipelago, which is located between Okinawa and Taiwan in the East China Sea. This action has led to diplomatic discussions between Japan and China, as both nations claim sovereignty over the islands. The lighthouse was constructed by right-wing Japanese activists as a representation of Japan's territorial claim over the islands and surrounding waters. The Chinese government allowed public demonstrations outside the Japanese embassy in Beijing, which marks the most notable expression of public discontent since 1999, when American warplanes accidentally bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. Beyond the symbolic and nationalistic aspects, the dispute reflects strategic considerations that may impact Sino-Japanese relations concerning maritime affairs. Both countries have significant dependencies on imported oil and gas, making the security of maritime energy supplies a critical concern. Reports suggest that the seabed near the Senkaku Islands may contain substantial oil and natural gas reserves, prompting Chinese exploration activities in the area, which Japan asserts encroaches upon its exclusive economic zone. Disputes over drilling rights have frequently occurred in Sino-Japanese relations. China's growing naval capabilities have raised concerns among its neighboring countries. In November, Japan's navy reported that a Chinese nuclear attack submarine was detected in Japanese waters near the Senkaku Islands. Shoichi Nakagawa, Japan's trade minister, linked the submarine sighting with Chinese gas exploration efforts in the vicinity of the islands. The Senkaku Islands are part of the 'first island chain,' a series of islands stretching from Japan to Taiwan to the Philippines along the Chinese coast. Strategic analysts in Beijing have historically been concerned about the potential risks posed by unfriendly control of this island chain to China's economic and military interests. The Chinese government has expressed reservations about U.S.-led initiatives aimed at maritime security along the Pacific Rim, including the Proliferation Security Initiative and the U.S. Pacific Command's Regional Maritime Security Initiative, which target threats such as piracy and terrorism."

        "original_text": "THE YUAN STILL ISN'T as easy to trade as most other currencies -- but that doesn't mean hedge funds and other speculators aren't already placing bets. In fact, they have been doing so for years. Despite China's currency revaluation, strict capital controls prevent the yuan from trading like a regular, free-floating currency. Speculators have turned to the derivatives market or indirect trades to wager on whether the yuan will appreciate against the dollar, including buying stocks of companies with large operations in China or trading in other Asian currencies. Most notably, the professional traders are using the so-called nondeliverable forward, or NDF, market, which enables them to bet on currencies whose fluctuations are restricted by government fiat. The trading volume for the NDF market for the Chinese yuan has ballooned to about $3 billion to $5 billion a day, trader say, and regularly heats up whenever market speculation intensifies that the Chinese are about to tinker with their currency regime. \"This corner of derivatives markets is not new to hedge funds, which have been participating in it for more than decade now,\" says Glenn Stevens, a managing director at GAIN Capital, a currency-trading company in Bedminster, N.J. \"The currency move by the Chinese will only heighten the activity and desire by speculators to participate further in these markets.\" Wednesday, the day before China announced the revaluation, the NDF market was predicting about a 6% revaluation of the yuan to about 7.8 to the dollar one year from now. Following yesterday's announcement of a 2.1% revaluation, the NDF traders were taking orders for bets for further revaluation ranging from 2.5% to 6% for 12-month contracts. Historically, the NDF market has been used by companies with large investments abroad to protect them from any abrupt move in the local currency. Besides the yuan, there are or have been NDF markets for the Brazilian real, Polish zloty, Argentine peso and Russian ruble. In recent years, however, NDFs have become increasingly popular among hedge funds not as protection but as a way to bet on which way controlled currencies will move. Yuan NDF purchasers enter into a contract to buy a certain amount of yuan at a set price over a designated period. The buyer either receives or pays the difference between what the yuan is trading at and what the buyer bets it will be. Big banks such as Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. often craft these contracts and may be the counterparty between two opposing bets. Until yesterday's move, every yuan NDF contract that expired was essentially worthless. These NDF contracts can be bought and sold like other securities, and some speculators have profited from trading at times when speculation that China would revalue was high. Traders say speculation is likely to build in the NDF market that the yuan will strengthen further. \"There's probably going to be more market speculation for a more meaningful move down the road,\" says Sophia Drossos, a currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York. \"I would expect to see that in the NDFs.\" The revaluation could lead to further development of the NDF market for the yuan, which up until now has been more like a playground for hedge funds and speculators. This isn't to say that all speculators are making money. Those who tried to place their bets on the currency's direction via, say, stocks may be on the wrong side of a trade. For instance, some speculators had purchased shares of U.S. retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which source many of their wares from Chinese suppliers. Those purchases amounted to bets that the revaluation was still a ways off. Now companies such as Wal-Mart could see higher costs. On the other hand, the revaluation is having a positive knock-on effect on the shares of makers of high-end consumer products, particularly in Europe and Japan, on which investors believe Asian and particularly Chinese consumers will spend their stronger currencies. For instance, shares in French luxury-fashion house LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton rallied 2.2% to a four-year high and rival Hermes International SA climbed 3% to a 15-month high. One hedge-fund manager who oversees more than $2 billion loaded up on Swiss and European consumer goods companies, such as Nestle SA, and sold U.S. brands such as Coca-Cola Co. and U.S. auto parts companies. This \"multistrategy\" manager believes the European company results will be boosted by a currency that is weaker against both dollar and yuan in coming months. Hedge funds have made other trades in Asian currencies that amounted to parallel bets on the timing and degree of the yuan revaluation. For example, many hedge funds have been buying Malaysian ringit Treasury bills, anticipating that the Malaysian currency will move up as well. Sure enough, Malaysia authorities yesterday said they were going to abandon their currency peg in favor of a so-called managed float, allowing the ringgit to trade in a band against a basket of currencies. \"This is more than just a single country's revaluation,\" says James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. \"This is a revaluation of an entire region, which is very significant for Europe, for Japan and for us,\" he adds.",
        "debiased_text": "The Chinese yuan remains subject to restrictions that prevent it from being traded as a typical, freely floating currency. Despite this, hedge funds and other speculators have been actively participating in markets that allow them to wager on the yuan's potential movement against the U.S. dollar. These participants often use the derivatives market or engage in indirect trades, such as purchasing stocks of companies with significant operations in China or trading in other Asian currencies. A notable method involves the use of non-deliverable forwards (NDFs), which are contracts that enable speculation on currencies with government-imposed exchange rate controls. The daily trading volume of the NDF market for the yuan has reached between $3 billion and $5 billion, according to traders, and tends to increase during periods of heightened speculation regarding potential changes to China's currency regime.\n\nPrior to China's recent announcement of a currency revaluation, the NDF market was predicting a 6% revaluation of the yuan to approximately 7.8 per dollar within one year. After the announcement of a 2.1% revaluation, NDF traders began taking orders for additional revaluation bets ranging from 2.5% to 6% for 12-month contracts. Historically, NDF markets have been used by businesses with foreign investments to hedge against sudden currency fluctuations, and similar markets have existed for currencies such the Brazilian real, Polish zloty, Argentine peso, and Russian ruble. In recent years, however, NDFs have been increasingly employed by hedge funds not for hedging but for speculative purposes.\n\nIn the yuan NDF market, participants enter into agreements to buy a specific amount of yuan at a predetermined price during a set period. At the end of the contract, the buyer either receives or pays the difference between the spot rate and the rate that was bet on. Major financial institutions such as Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. often create these contracts and serve as counterparties in trades between opposing parties. Before the recent revaluation, all expiring yuan NDF contracts were essentially worthless.\n\nThese contracts are traded similarly to other financial instruments, and some investors have profited during periods of high speculation about a potential revaluation. Traders indicate that speculation regarding further strengthening of the yuan is likely to continue. A currency strategist at Morgan Stanley noted that there may be more market speculation in the future regarding a substantial movement in the yuan's value.\n\nThe revaluation could potentially lead to increased development of the yuan NDF market, which has historically functioned as a primary arena for hedge funds and speculators. It is important to note that not all speculators have benefited from these moves. For example, those who placed bets on the direction of the yuan via stocks, such as U.S. retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc., may have been affected by increased costs following the revaluation. In contrast, some investors have seen gains by investing in high-end consumer products manufacturers in Europe and Japan, anticipating that stronger Chinese purchasing power would benefit those sectors. For instance, shares in LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Hermes International SA experienced gains. A hedge-fund manager overseeing over $2 billion in assets increased positions in Swiss and European consumer goods firms like Nestle SA while reducing exposure to U.S. brands such as Coca-Cola Co. and U.S. auto parts companies, based on the expectation that the euro and other currencies may weaken relative to the yuan in the future.\n\nHedge funds have also made investments in other Asian currencies, effectively making parallel bets regarding the timing and extent of the yuan's revaluation. For example, hedge funds have been purchasing Malaysian ringgit Treasury bills, as Malaysian authorities announced they would move away from a currency peg, allowing the ringgit to trade within a flexible band against a basket of currencies. A chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management described the development as not just a revaluation in one country but as a revaluation across a region, with significant implications for Europe, Japan, and the U.S."

The international press freedom group Reporters Without Borders has criticised the new rules, saying they would force people with dissenting opinions to shift websites overseas. Mainland Chinese users could be barred from accessing them because of government censorship filters. \"Those who continue to publish under their real names on sites hosted in China will either have to avoid political subjects or just relay the Communist party's propaganda,\" the group said. \"This decision will enable those in power to control online news and information much more effectively.\" The latest restrictions follow the introduction of many other measures.

        "original_text": "* First-quarter leap raises overheating fears * Trade surplus soars as demand remains strong * Currency reform calls likely to strengthen China's economy expanded by an unexpectedly strong 9.5 percent in the first quarter, driven by a soaring trade surplus and powerful consumer demand. Official statistics released yesterday will bolster hopes that retail sales and exports are reducing the Chinese economy's reliance on investment as an engine of growth, a dependency often seen as a structural weakness. But the continuing high rate of year-on-year growth - well above government targets for the year - will keep alive concerns of possible overheating, while the Dollars 16.6bn trade surplus published for the quarter is likely to intensify US calls for revaluation of the renminbi. Exports surged 35 per cent year-on-year to Dollars 156bn in the first three months, while imports grew a relatively slim 12 per cent to Dollars 139bn. Economists said the trade surplus in part reflected reduced domestic demand following government action to cool the economy. \"The composition of growth is healthier than last year,\" said Ben Simpfendorfer, an economist at JPMorgan. \"There has been steady, robust consumer spending coupled with a buoyant export sector.\" Domestic consumption in the first quarter was strong, with total retail sales up 13.7 per cent, compared with growth of 13.3 for all of 2004. Zheng Jingping, spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, said government efforts to rein in investment through administrative measures introduced last year had shown clear progress. Fixed-asset investment was up 22.8 per cent year-on-year in the first three months - far below the growth rates of more than 40 per cent early last year. \"The growth rate is still high, but the momentum of investment in fixed assets has been restrained,\" Mr Zheng said. But he underlined Beijing's commitment to keeping investment in big projects under control by monitoring credit growth, strengthening land use controls and enforcing environmental standards. In a sign of continued investor confidence, urban fixed- asset investment climbed 26 per cent year-on-year in March, up from the 24.5 per cent recorded for the first two months of 2005. Beijing has been particularly concerned about investment trends in urban property markets, with some experts warning of dangerous price bubbles in big cities such as Shanghai. Mr Zheng said property investment accounted for about a fifth of total investment, up from about 12 per cent in the late 1990s, and drew attention to government efforts to limit property speculation. \"We should encourage people to buy homes for living purposes and not for investment purposes,\" he said. Some observers said the strength of the economy would increase the chance that China might raise interest rates again and prompt a slight loosening of its currency peg. The strong export growth is likely further to fuel US demands for currency reform. Ministers from most of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations backed a US call at the weekend for Beijing to adopt immediately a more flexible currency regime. China, which is unwilling to tailor its policy to the demands of trading partners such as the US, has so far ignored the G7 call.

The trade surplus for the quarter reached 16.6 billion dollars, with exports increasing by 35 percent year-on-year to 156 billion dollars and imports rising by 12 percent to 139 billion dollars.

        "original_text": "Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's chief executive, is preparing to step down early from his post following his appointment yesterday to China's leading political advisory body. Mr Tung, Hong Kong's first post-colonial leader following the 1997 transfer of sovereignty from Britain, has faced growing criticism of his administration. Over recent months he has played a less visible role, with Sir Donald Tsang, the chief secretary, taking charge of some of the most sensitive issues on the territory's agenda. Under Hong Kong's post-colonial constitution, Sir Donald would take over as acting chief executive should Mr Tung step down. In December, Hu Jintao, China's president, took the unusual step of publicly criticising Hong Kong's government during a ceremony in Macao. Mr Hu said Hong Kong officials should \"look over the past seven years and find out what has gone wrong\". Mr Tung later denied the comments were a dressing down, but failed to quell speculation that Beijing was unhappy with his performance. He has struggled to assert his leadership and has faced a number of protests, including a July 2003 demonstration that drew hundreds of thousands of people to the streets and that forced his government to shelve controversial anti-subversion legislation. One of 10 prominent Hong Kong people appointed to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Mr Tung is also widely expected to be nominated as a vice-chairman of the body. Although this would be a position equal to a \"state leader\", the CPPCC's powers are largely symbolic and the body is seen as a transition point for Chinese officials on their way to retirement. The CPPCC is the most junior of China's four \"leadership bodies\". The top body is the Communist party central committee, followed by the cabinet or State Council and the National People's Congress or national parliament. The chairmen and vice-chairmen of these bodies are considered \"state leaders\", but their political power varies widely. Christine Loh, a former lawmaker and chief executive of Civic Exchange, a Hong Kong think-tank, said she would not be surprised if Mr Tung were to resign. \"I was always sure that on his retirement from his post he would be given some honorary appointment, which is exactly what becoming a vice-chairman of the CPPCC would be,\" Ms Loh said.",

Tung is one of 10 notable Hong Kong individuals appointed to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and is likely to be nominated as a vice-chairman of the body. While the position is considered equivalent to that of a 'state leader,' the CPPCC's role is largely symbolic and is viewed as a transitional body for Chinese officials nearing retirement. The CPPCC is the least senior of China's four main leadership bodies, which include the Communist Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the National People's Congress. The chairmen and vice-chairmen of these bodies are regarded as 'state leaders,' though their influence can vary significantly. Christine Loh, a former lawmaker and head of Civic Exchange, a Hong Kong think-tank, stated she would not be surprised if Tung were to resign. 'I was always sure that on his retirement from his post he would be given some honorary appointment, which is exactly what becoming a vice-chairman of the CPPCC would be,' Loh noted."

        "title": "Larry Elliott: Britain relies heavily on global balancing act",
        "original_text": "British general elections tend to be parochial affairs. Sometimes a big foreign policy event looms in the background, such as the Falklands war or the invasion of Iraq, but while the campaign is on, a visitor from another planet might believe that the rest of the world had ceased to exist. So far, the campaign has boiled down to one issue: which party can do its sums. Labour says the Tories cannot be taken seriously when they talk about cutting taxes, cutting borrowing and increasing spending at the same time. The Tories say that Labour has a black hole that it will fill with tax increases if it wins on May 5. Both arguments have some merit, although the Conservatives have the tougher job in persuading voters that they can make their fiscal arithmetic work by shaving £35bn off public spending. Gordon Brown has had a grand old time attacking Oliver Letwin's plans for being a ragbag of nonsense, and with good reason, since the Conservative fiscal plans look flakier than anything Labour came up with during its long years in opposition. Even so, the chancellor could have done without the International Monetary Fund last week issuing one of its regular warnings about the need to rein in spending or raise taxes and gave the fund's managing director, Rodrigo de Rato, both barrels at a press conference in Washington on Saturday. Brown insisted that he had been proved right in the past and would be proved right again. The fact is, however, that the IMF is not alone in thinking that action will be required sooner or later if Brown is to keep to his own fiscal rules: the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Institute for Fiscal Studies and an array of City analysts all say the same. Brown believes the IMF's economists are dogmatic neo-liberals who make a fetish of balanced budgets and he argues that Britain's public finances are in far better shape than those of other leading industrial nations. He's right about that, but although he won't lose much sleep about being taken to task about the fund, he should be concerned about the grotesque imbalances in the global economy and the impact that a period of severe disruption could have on Britain. The debate in the UK about tax and spend will look a lot different should the economy grow less rapidly than the Treasury is anticipating, let alone suffer from its first recession in more than a decade. The chances of that happening would be substantially greater in the event of a global downturn, and despite the confidence of the IMF there are two reasons to be concerned. One is that the problems of the global economy - highlighted at meeting after meeting - are getting worse, not better. The other is that nothing is being done about it. The G7 group of finance ministers was set up in the 1970s as a means by which the rich countries could coordinate economic policy. It is supposed to have a full and frank discussion of the state of the global economy and come up with solutions that all members can sign up to. It is, however, many years since the G7 fulfilled this role and its meetings are now dialogues of the deaf. Here's the problem. The United States has a whopping trade deficit, running at more than $60bn (£32bn) a month. It acts as the spender of last resort for the global economy, pulling in imports from the rest of the world. At some point, although nobody knows when for sure, the deficit will have to be cut. That can only be achieved if domestic demand in the US grows more slowly than growth overall, with resources diverted from consumption into exports. The Americans believe that could happen if the rest of the developed world - Europe and Japan - grew more quickly, although there would have to be a staggering increase in growth in these laggards for this to happen. Alternatively, the dollar could fall - making US exports cheaper - and fiscal policy could be tightened to prevent a cheaper currency leading to higher inflation. This, though, would be painful for American consumers. The prospect of a period of belt-tightening has started to have both economic and political consequences. There are signs that the economy is losing a bit of momentum, and there are growing grumbles about the unwillingness of the Chinese to revalue the yuan. Protectionist voices are being heard on Capitol Hill. Clearly, the potential is there for a period of considerable upheaval. If, for example, the US trade deficit continued to expand, there will come a point when the holders of US assets will panic. The Asians who have financed the US trade deficit by buying American bonds and equities will start to take fright at the prospect that the value of these assets will be reduced by a devaluation of the dollar. If they dump them, the dollar could go into freefall. Interest rates in the US would go up sharply and the economy would tank. Given America's importance to the global economy, everybody else would suffer too. Clearly, the potential is also there for the G7 plus China to manage the problem away. In the 1980s, when exchange rates were as out of kilter as they are today, there were agreements to do something about it. There is nothing like a Plaza agreement or a Louvre accord on the horizon today, however, and the likelihood is that the G7 will only get its act together when the crisis has already broken. A similar inertia has also gripped the IMF and the World Bank. The IMF's initial purpose was to manage the international monetary system in an era of fixed exchange rates and capital controls, but its sphere of operations has gradually shrunk. It no longer has any real role in the developed world, but rather lends large amounts of cash to middle-income countries when they have financial crises and lays down the law to poor countries. The G7 is conducting a review of the IMF and the starting point for that should be what the organisation is actually for. Making poor countries richer should be the job of the World Bank; the fund needs more firepower if it is to be an effective lender of last resort. If the inability of the G7 and the IMF to coordinate effective action to tackle global economic imbalances is one example of a dysfunctional international economic management, the painfully slow progress towards a deal on development is another. Labour has done much to be proud of in this field over the past eight years and its manifesto promises to do a lot more in a third term. Although the chancellor spent less than 24 hours in Washington, he had breakfast with Paul Wolfowitz, the next president of the World Bank, and used his role as chairman of the IMF's main policy-making committee to press for more generous help for poor countries and had dinner with Kofi Annan to discuss the UN's special summit on development in September. There is some frustration at the Treasury that progress on development is slower than anticipated at the time of the February meeting of the G7 in London, when there was confidence that a deal on multilateral debt would be sealed in Washington over the weekend. Brown's achievement over the past two years has been to create unanimity in the G7 that something has to be done; the problem is that finance ministers are wary of asking their taxpayers to foot the bill. Brown thinks the politicians are behind the people on this, and he's right. There will be action on development by the time of the G8 summit at Gleneagles. But with storm clouds gathering over the global economy, the question is just how good that deal will be.",
        "debiased_text": "British general elections often focus on domestic issues, with foreign policy events sometimes taking a backseat. During the current campaign, the central issue has been fiscal policy, with both the Labour and Conservative parties presenting arguments regarding the feasibility of their respective economic plans. Labour claims the Conservatives' approach of reducing taxes, borrowing, and increasing spending simultaneously is unsustainable. Conversely, the Conservatives assert that Labour's plans would require significant tax increases to address potential budget shortfalls. The Conservative proposal involves reducing public spending by £35bn, which presents a challenge in convincing voters of its feasibility. Gordon Brown has criticized the Conservative fiscal plans, stating they are inconsistent, and this critique is supported by various analyses. However, Brown has faced criticism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has issued warnings about the need for spending control or tax increases. The IMF, along with other organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and financial analysts, has suggested that some form of fiscal adjustment might be necessary. Brown argues that the IMF's stance is overly focused on balanced budgets and that the British economy is comparatively healthier than other major industrial nations. While this assertion holds some truth, concerns remain regarding the broader imbalances in the global economy and the possible consequences of economic disruption on the UK. The likelihood of economic downturns and the current global economic challenges have implications on the UK's fiscal debates. The US has a significant trade deficit, which has raised concerns about future economic adjustments. Either the global economy must grow more rapidly, or the US dollar must depreciate, both of which pose challenges. Additionally, international economic coordination has been lacking, with the G7 group's recent meetings failing to achieve meaningful solutions. The IMF and World Bank have also shown signs of inefficiency in dealing with global economic issues. Despite these challenges, Brown has worked to foster international consensus on addressing these issues. While progress on development issues is slower than desired, there is expected to be some agreement by the time of the G8 summit at Gleneagles. However, the uncertainty surrounding global economic conditions raises concerns about the extent and effectiveness of such agreements."

Prime Minister Sharon left the rightwing Likud, the party he co-founded, triggering a general election in March and a huge shift in the political landscape. Mr Sharon's move, provoked by new Labour leader Amir Peretz's withdrawal from the ruling coalition, was seen as an astute tactical move and opinion polls made his new party, National Responsibility, favourites in a close run with Labour. Opinion was divided on whether the realignment of Israeli politics would improve peace prospects but British views were crystal clear over Israeli tactics to annex Arab east Jerusalem. A confidential Foreign Office document said the Israelis were jeopardising peace. The HIV/Aids pandemic was highlighted by a UN report estimating that 40 million were living with the virus. Five million more cases were reported last year, an under-estimate given unreliable data from China and India. The Chinese faced a different threat after a chemical factory blast polluted water supplies in the north-eastern city of Harbin, where citizens had to find alternative supplies through stockpiling or clearing supermarket shelves. The spill raised more questions about China's environmental policies. In Kenya the government lost a referendum on changing the constitution in a vote that split largely on tribal lines, and the president, Mwai Kibaki, responded by sacking all his ministers.

        "original_text": "A meeting between the foreign ministers of China and Japan was abruptly cancelled yesterday after the Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, paid tribute to Japan's war dead at a nationalist Shinto shrine, drawing an angry response from China and South Korea. In an apparent attempt to placate Japan's Asian neighbours, who regard Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo as a symbol of Japanese militarism, Mr Koizumi wore a business suit rather than ceremonial dress and did not enter the revered inner shrine, choosing instead to pray and make a token monetary offering at the outer shrine. But the visit, the fifth of Mr Koizumi's premiership, prompted a furious outburst from China, with the country's ambassador to Tokyo calling it a \"grave provocation to the Chinese people\". The Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement: \"Towards his wilful injury of Chinese feelings and dignity, and serious wrongdoings to hurt Sino-Japanese relations, the Chinese government and people express strong indignation.\" The foreign ministers' meeting planned for later this week was cancelled, and protesters shouted anti-Japanese slogans outside the Japanese embassy in Beijing. Yasukuni honours 2.5 million Japanese who have died in wars since the end of the 19th century. Among them are 14 class-A war criminals hanged by the allies after the war, including the wartime prime minister, Hideki Tojo. Although there were no reports of violence in Beijing, Japan warned its nationals to be cautious in case of a repeat of April's violent anti-Japanese demonstrations, called after Tokyo approved a history textbook that plays down atrocities by Japanese troops in China before and during the second world war. Officials in Seoul said the South Korean president, Roh Moo-hyun, was unlikely to meet Mr Koizumi for a summit originally planned for later this year. An unrepentant Mr Koizumi insisted he had paid his respects at Yasukuni as a private citizen and had done so to demonstrate his commitment to peace, not to celebrate Japanese militarism. In a swipe at Beijing and Seoul, he added: \"A foreign government should not take issue with the way the Japanese express condolences to the Japanese war dead, as well as to the world's war dead.\" Despite the bravado, Mr Koizumi, Japan's most hawkish prime minister for years, has avoided visiting Yasukuni on August 15 - the anniversary of the end of the war. While the powerful lobby of war-bereaved families and conservative politicians applaud the pilgrimages, Japanese businesses fear they could harm trade with China, worth $212bn (£120bn) a year. Analysts noted that yesterday's visit came soon after Mr Koizumi had bolstered his personal authority by securing a huge majority in the September 11 general election and less than a week after his controversial postal privatisation bills were passed. \"Nobody can speak against him now,\" Minoru Morita, a political analyst, told the Associated Press. But the visit is expected to further sour Japan's relations with China. The countries are embroiled in disputes over the ownership of island chains and gas deposits, and Beijing says it will oppose Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the UN security council unless Tokyo shows greater remorse for its wartime atrocities. The Japanese public, fearful of confrontation with China, is divided over Yasukuni. A poll taken over the weekend found that 47.6% supported Mr Koizumi's visits, while 45.5% opposed them. Last month the Osaka high court ruled that the visits violated the constitutional separation of religion and the state, although other local courts have ruled in his favour.",
        "debiased_text": "A meeting between the foreign ministers of China and Japan was cancelled after the Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, visited a Shinto shrine that honors Japan's war dead.

Koizumi made a monetary offering and prayed at the outer shrine rather than entering the inner shrine, and he wore a business suit instead of ceremonial dress. The Chinese government expressed strong disapproval of the visit, citing concerns over the injury of Chinese feelings and the potential negative impact on Sino-Japanese relations. The ambassador of China to Tokyo described the visit as a 'grave provocation to the Chinese people'. The planned meeting between the foreign ministers was consequently cancelled, and there were reports of anti-Japanese slogans being shouted by protesters outside the Japanese embassy in Beijing. South Korea also indicated that the planned summit between its president and Koizumi would likely not proceed. Koizumi stated that his visit was as a private citizen and aimed at expressing condolences to the war dead, rather than celebrating Japanese militarism. He also remarked that a foreign government should not question how Japan honors its war dead. Koizumi avoided visiting Yasukuni on August 15, the anniversary of the end of World War II, despite the support from some political and familial groups. Japanese businesses have expressed concerns that such visits could negatively affect trade relations with China, which amounts to $212 billion annually. The timing of the shrine visit followed Koizumi's recent political strengthening, which included securing a large majority in the September 11 general election and the passage of his postal privatisation bills. The Japanese public is divided on the issue, with recent polls indicating that 47.6% support Koizumi's visits and 45.5% oppose them. In a related legal development, the Osaka High Court ruled that the visits may violate the constitutional separation of religion and state, although other courts have ruled in favor of Koizumi's actions. Meanwhile, ongoing disputes between Japan and China, including issues over island chains and gas deposits, and China's stance on Japan's UN Security Council bid, are expected to remain unresolved."

        "original_text": "Britain and its EU allies were heading for failure last night in their first attempt to penalise Iran for its nuclear ambitions by having Tehran reported promptly to the UN security council. But a British-crafted compromise backing away from an instant referral to the security council retained withering criticism of Iran and held open the option of security council action at a later date. Amid frantic discussions at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, the EU troika of Britain, France, and Germany withdrew a hardline draft resolution that called for Iran to be reported to the security council for breaching the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). The wording could not command sufficient support among the 35 countries on the IAEA board, with Russia in particular rejecting security council action. Rather than pushing the resolution to a divisive vote, the British drafted a new formula which was being discussed last night. The tough language, however, remained hard to swallow for Russia, India, China and most of the 14 non-aligned members of the board. \"If you go with this language, it still ends up at the security council,\" said a diplomat familiar with the IAEA. \"This is not conducive to negotiations. It's still a fait accompli. This new resolution is unlikely to fly, there's no consensus.\" EU members, with strong American backing, were demanding unanimous support for the new revised formula. Otherwise they could revert to the earlier demand for instant security council referral and insist on putting that to the vote. With Russia and China opposed - countries which have vetoes on the security council - the EU and the Americans were reluctant to push the issue. The new British-authored document, obtained by The Guardian, says: · Iran is not complying with the NPT; · There is an international \"absence of confidence that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes\"; · Iran must expand the scope of UN nuclear inspections by providing \"any access to location, personnel and information\" requested by IAEA investigators; · It must reinstate the freeze on uranium processing lifted by the Iranians last month; · It must return to negotiations with the EU that collapsed last month. The tough wording also holds open the possibility of future resort to the security council by referring to IAEA statutes and by declaring that Iran's conduct has \"given rise to questions that are within the competence of the security council\". There was no mention of sanctions, which the security council is empowered to impose. For the past two years of negotiations on the nuclear dispute between Iran and the EU, the Europeans kept to their pledge to the Iranians to resist US pressure to take the crisis to the security council. This week for the first time joined the Americans, with Britain taking the lead in Vienna and in talks with senior Iranian figures in New York. \"This is a critical moment,\" said a senior Iranian official. But the Iranians appear to have the upper hand, successfully lobbying for support from Russia, India and China. But the outcome is still unclear. Even the new document being haggled over last night may be unacceptable to a significant minority of the IAEA board and could be opposed by the IAEA chief, Mohamed ElBaradei. Dr El Baradei, while frustrated by the Iranians' tactics and their frequent ploys aimed at confounding the UN nuclear inspectors, fears that taking the dispute to the security council will hobble his inspections and worsen the crisis. Tehran publicly hailed yesterday's tabling of a new document as a European climbdown. In private, Iranian officials viewed it as a face-saving formula for both sides that could lead to resumed negotiations. \"The British are taking the lead on this. They are being bolder than the others,\" said a senior Iranian official. The IAEA board invariably takes decisions by consensus. But strong statements to the closed board session on Wednesday from the British and US ambassadors as well as from Canada, Australia and Japan, calling for security council action on Iran, were followed yesterday by opposing speeches from Russia, China, India, and non-aligned countries.",

This proposed resolution includes statements that Iran is not in compliance with the NPT, that there is a lack of confidence in Iran's nuclear program being exclusively peaceful, and that Iran should allow broader access to locations, personnel, and information for IAEA inspectors. Additionally, the document calls for Iran to reinstate a freeze on uranium processing and return to negotiations with the EU, which had previously collapsed. The resolution also references IAEA statutes and mentions that Iran's actions have \"given rise to questions that are within the competence of the Security Council,\" but it does not explicitly call for sanctions, which are under the Security Council's authority. Over the past two years, European nations had committed to resisting U.S. pressure to escalate the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council. This week, however, they aligned with the United States, with Britain leading efforts in Vienna and in New York meetings with senior Iranian officials. A senior Iranian official described the situation as a critical moment. The Iranians have been successful in gaining support from Russia, India, and China, who are opposed to an immediate Security Council referral. However, the outcome remains uncertain, with concerns that the new document may not be accepted by a significant portion of the IAEA board or could face opposition from the IAEA chief, Mohamed ElBaradei. ElBaradei expressed concerns that moving the dispute to the Security Council may hinder IAEA inspections and heighten tensions. Tehran publicly praised the submission of the new document as a European retreat. In private, Iranian officials viewed it as a potentially agreeable resolution for both sides that could pave the way for renewed negotiations. The IAEA board typically makes decisions by consensus. On Wednesday, a closed session of the board heard strong statements from the British and U.S. ambassadors, as well as from Canada, Australia, and Japan, supporting Security Council action. This was followed by opposing views from Russia, China, India, and non-aligned nations on Thursday."

        "title": "Chinese general warns of nuclear risk to US",
        "original_text": "A senior Chinese general has warned that his country could destroy hundreds of American cities with nuclear weapons if the two nations clashed over Taiwan. Major general Zhu Chenghu, a dean at the National Defence University, said he was expressing a private opinion, but his comments, the most inflammatory by a senior government official in 10 years, will fuel growing concerns in Washington about the rise of China. Speaking at a lecture arranged by the foreign ministry and attended by several foreign correspondents on Thursday, Mr Zhu said China was prepared to initiate non-conventional warfare over Taiwan. \"War logic dictates that a weaker power needs to use maximum efforts to defeat a stronger rival,\" he was reported as saying by the New York Times. \"If the Americans draw their missiles and position-guided ammunition on to the target zone on China's territory, I think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons.\" Echoing threats last made in 1995, Mr Zhu, who has a reputation as a hawk in Chinese military circles, said his country was ready to sustain heavy casualties in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other heavily populated areas. \"We Chinese will prepare ourselves for the destruction of all of the cities east of Xian,\" he said. \"Of course, the Americans will have to be prepared that hundreds of cities will be destroyed by the Chinese.\" Although Mr Zhu said war was unlikely, his proposal that China should adopt a first-strike nuclear option against the US will alarm the Pentagon. China tested its first atomic bomb in 1964, but it claims that its arsenal of nuclear weapons is the smallest among the five nations on the UN security council. According to a recent article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, China has only 18 intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the US mainland. Most sit in their silos unarmed. However, US intelligence predicts that over the next 15 years, China will expand its IBM force to 75-100 strategic nuclear warheads targeted primarily at the US. They will be mounted on a new mobile solid-fuel rocket, the Dong Feng-31, and, possibly, miniaturised for launch from China's submarine fleet. The US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, recently expressed concern about Beijing's growing military power. Such strategic fears come at a time of rising Sino-American tensions over the bilateral trade deficit and competition for global energy resources. The Chinese government refused to comment on Mr Zhu's statement, but in recent weeks the state-run media has carried several articles rebutting US claims about a military build-up. Earlier this month, Major General Ding Jiye, head of the finance office of the People's Liberation Army, said the 12.6% rise in defence spending this year was in line with economic growth and was mainly used to improve the living conditions of soldiers. The China Daily, the English-language paper aimed at an overseas audience, focused on the planned reduction of 200,000 military personnel from the 2.5 million-strong army by the end of this year. Analysts say China has learned from the collapse of the Soviet Union that it would be economic suicide to attempt an arms race with the US. But there are still risks of a clash over Taiwan, a self-governing island that China considers part of its territory and the US has vowed to protect. The president of the European commission, José Manuel Barroso, urged his hosts yesterday to resume dialogue with Taiwan before 2008. \"This will also greatly advance China's international standing and reputation as a global player with a particular responsibility for peace and security in east Asia,\" said Mr Barroso, who was on his first official trip to China.",
        "debiased_text": "A senior Chinese general, Zhu Chenghu, who is a dean at the National Defence University, stated during a lecture arranged by the foreign ministry and attended by several foreign correspondents that China could potentially destroy hundreds of American cities with nuclear weapons in the event of a conflict over Taiwan. Zhu emphasized that his comments were a private opinion. His remarks, which are considered the most provocative by a senior government official in a decade, are likely to increase concerns in Washington regarding China's growing military influence. During the lecture, Zhu indicated that China is prepared to use non-conventional warfare strategies in a conflict involving Taiwan. He cited the principle of war logic, stating that a weaker power may need to employ maximum efforts to counter a stronger rival. Zhu mentioned that if the United States were to deploy missiles and guided munitions into a target zone on Chinese territory, China might respond with nuclear weapons. He also referenced past threats made in 1995, noting that China is willing to endure significant casualties in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. Zhu stated that China would prepare for the potential destruction of cities located east of Xian and warned that the United States should be ready for the destruction of numerous cities by China. While Zhu acknowledged that war between the two nations is unlikely, his suggestion of a first-strike nuclear option against the United States has raised concerns within the Pentagon. China conducted its first atomic bomb test in 1964 and asserts that its nuclear arsenal is the smallest among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. According to a recent report in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, China currently possesses only 18 intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the United States mainland, with most of these missiles stored in silos without warheads. US intelligence estimates predict that China will increase its intercontinental ballistic missile force to 75-100 strategic nuclear warheads over the next 15 years, which will likely be equipped with a new mobile solid-fuel rocket, the Dong Feng-31, and possibly miniaturized warheads for submarine-based launches. The US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, recently voiced concerns over the increasing military capabilities of Beijing. These strategic anxieties arise during a period of heightened tensions between the United States and China, driven by issues such as the bilateral trade deficit and competition for global energy resources. The Chinese government did not comment on Zhu's statements, but state-run media has recently published several articles challenging US claims about China's military expansion. Earlier this month, Major General Ding Jiye, head of the finance office of the People's Liberation Army, indicated that the 12.6% increase in defence spending for the current year aligns with economic growth and is primarily intended to enhance soldiers' living conditions. The China Daily, an English-language publication aimed at an international audience, highlighted the planned reduction of 200,000 military personnel from the 2.5 million-strong Chinese army by the end of the year. Analysts suggest that China has learned from the collapse of the Soviet Union that engaging in an arms race with the United States would be economically damaging. Nevertheless, potential conflicts over Taiwan, a self-governing island that China regards as part of its territory and the United States has pledged to protect, continue to pose risks. José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European commission, urged Chinese officials during his first official visit to China to resume dialogue with Taiwan before 2008, stating that such actions could enhance China's international standing and reputation as a responsible global actor in promoting peace and security in east Asia."

        "original_text": "Boeing could face civil charges alleging it violated US restrictions on the sale of military technologies to China. A state department spokesman said the government was in negotiations with the aircraft maker over potential violations of US export rules relating to sales of civilian aircraft to China between 2000 and 2003. At issue is the sale of a coin-sized guidance chip, known as the QRS-11, embedded in the flight systems of commercial aircraft sold to China by Boeing. The chip, made by a Californian company, is part of a commercial navigation system made by Thales of France and used not only by Boeing but by Airbus, Bombardier and other aircraft makers. It has also been used in missile guidance systems, however, and has been classified by the US government as a \"munitions\" item that cannot normally be sold to China. The Seattle Times, which first reported the story yesterday, said a state department draft of possible charges against Boeing alleged the company committed 94 violations of export laws by shipping aircraft containing the chip without first obtaining a licence from the US government. Washington claims the company knew it was violating US laws when it made the sales, and continued after it was told to stop. The developments come as Boeing is trying to shake off a series of government procurement-related scandals. The company could face fines of as much as Dollars 47m under the charges. Boeing would not comment, saying it was continuing to work with the state department on a resolution. The charges could also raise new questions over the application of US export controls, which many companies say needlessly prohibit sales. When the issue of the QRS-11 sales first arose between Boeing and the state department in 2003, the department waived the law to allow two jet sales to China to proceed. The US government then further agreed in January 2004 to permit future sales as long as the chip was embedded in a navigation system. Airbus, however, says it was forced to delay several sales while it sought export licences, and to remove the QRS-11 chip from aircraft it had already sold.",
        "debiased_text": "Boeing may be under consideration for civil charges related to alleged violations of US export restrictions on military technologies to China.

The US government claims Boeing was aware of these violations and continued the sales even after being instructed to cease. These developments follow a period of multiple government procurement-related controversies involving the company. Boeing could face potential fines of up to $47 million if the charges are finalized. As of now, Boeing has not issued any public comments, stating that it is in the process of working with the state department to address the matter. The potential charges may also prompt further discussion on the application of US export controls, which some companies argue impose unnecessary restrictions on sales. In 2003, the US state department issued a waiver to Boeing to allow two jet sales to China to proceed despite the QRS-11 issue. In January 2004, the US government agreed to permit future sales of aircraft equipped with the chip, provided it was embedded in a navigation system. Meanwhile, Airbus reportedly had to delay several sales while pursuing export licenses and removed the QRS-11 chip from aircraft it had previously sold."

        "title": "On tour with Tottenham in Mauritius",
        "original_text": "'I'm not going back in there!' Michael Dawson yelps, sprinting out of the sea. 'I just saw a snake fish!' The Tottenham defender's amused team-mates watch from their sun loungers as he waves his hands about to show the size of the creature. This is 'down time' - a rare chance for the players to relax. Tottenham are in Mauritius on an off-season tour. These trips are increasingly popular: Manchester United are heading for Hong Kong and Japan, Arsenal and Real Madrid to a retreat in Austria, Manchester City to Thailand, Chelsea went to Korea. Tottenham's trip to a tropical island stirred envy among other teams. 'Can we swap?' José Mourinho asked Martin Jol as he set off for Seoul. Summer tours are primarily profit-making ventures, with clubs exploiting the spending potential of fans whose own leagues cannot compete with Europe. Spurs, keen to spread the club's brand, had been to Mauritius before, with Bill Nicholson in 1974. Back then, local club games could fill the stadiums, but these days the Premiership is far more popular. The change came in 1999 when all competitive sport on the island was banned for 18 months. At that time Mauritian football was in turmoil since club allegiances depended on race and religion, which led to repeated outbreaks of violence. Events came to a head after a match between Muslim Scouts and Roman Catholic side Fire Brigade, which sparked three days of rioting and ended with seven people dead. Only the national team were given permission to play during the ban and 'home' matches took place on the neighbouring island of Reunion. When the league was reformed, new clubs were set up on the basis of regions and the fans shunned them in favour of the Premiership. Across the island, houses are daubed with club badges and placards are nailed to trees. Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool and now Chelsea are the most popular teams, though a visit from Tottenham may have helped elevate their status. There is no sign of support for either Milan or Paris St Germain, the clubs that have just sold and bought the most successful player of Mauritian descent, Vikash Dhorasoo. The trip, sponsored by Air Mauritius, was run in conjunction with travel agent Suresh Taurah, who has lived and worked in the Tottenham area of London since 1968. As an ex-pat Mauritian, he promotes the Mauritian Sports Association (MSA) who play in the Middlesex County Premier League, and hopes they will act as a feeder for the national team in his homeland. As part of the cultural exchange he has brought four of the squad to play for the national side against Tottenham, the tour's main event. Day one: afternoon Bleary-eyed after a 12-hour flight, the team land at Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam international airport packed with locals dressed in Manchester United shirts as Taurah doles out the garlands to his visitors. Local press and fans swarm on to the teambus for interviews and autographs, which the players are happy to grant. After checking into the hotel, a press call is scheduled. The Mauritians seem unsure what to ask Frank Arnesen, Martin Jol, Ledley King and the others on an eight-man panel, and inquire about Liverpool and other Premiership clubs. Two further questions follow after which the local media sit in stubborn silence. 'They wouldn't ask any questions,' laughs Jermain Defoe. 'If that had been England we would have been there all night.' Tottenham's standing among the locals is evident when Defoe is approached by a radio reporter. 'The guy said to me, \"If you could play for any team who would you play for?\" I said to him, \"What, on the PlayStation? Be serious, you can't ask me that.\"' Day two: morning Today is Christmas at the Rose Belle school,' the announcer intones over the speakers as the players battle the rain to reach a marquee in the schoolyard. 'Christmas has come early, children,' he repeats. Lining the dirt path behind the school, hordes of shivering children, in their specially manufactured multi-coloured Tottenham baseball caps, are blowing plastic horns to greet their esteemed guests. 'I feel so bad for them,' says Irish full-back Stephen Kelly. 'They've been out there for half an hour just to do a dance for us.' Little girls in brightly coloured outfits shake sodden pompoms to the beats of a Mauritian medley while the players look on from the shelter of a large tent. Behind the fences and in the trees overlooking the muddy yard, hundreds have gathered to catch a glimpse of the Premiership visitors. Some even manage to sneak in and watch as the team take to the pitch to train with the kids. They seem glad to get out and get stuck in. Robbie Keane is the first to come up against the language barrier, struggling to get his group to stand in a line. 'Excuse me, where is Jamie Redknapp?' a little girl asks, unaware that he has not only moved on but is preparing to announce his retirement. The exercise session soon turns into an autograph hunt. Keane, his face streaked with dirt, is surrounded by a muddy mob, waving pictures from the goody bags they've been given. Michael Brown is handing out more, hobbling through the mire on his plastic foot cast. Even the injured players have come along, as Spurs see this as an excellent opportunity for team bonding. Defoe is still kicking a ball around with the winner of the 'player-of-the-day' award. 'He was good, you know,' Defoe says. 'Being a footballer you can just tell straight away.' When the players are led away from the melee, they look disappointed. 'It was only supposed to last an hour,' Kelly says. 'We were there for two, maybe three. We'd have stayed there all day but we have to stick to the schedule.' Next is an open training session at a run-down playing field. More crowds gather to watch the warm-ups and shuttle runs, among them a group of die-hard Tottenham supporters, who have travelled 6,000 miles to be with their team. 'I'm married to Spurs,' says Roy Woodward, a 62-year-old from Edmonton, preparing to make the Mauritius friendly his 2,700th first-team game. 'But one of my hobbies is travel so it's a good combination. I've travelled all over with the club, South Africa, the US, China, Japan and across Europe.' Behind the fans, a treatment table has been put up and Brown and Dawson are given massages in front of spectators and stray dogs. Before long a mini-market is set up, with vendors selling hot snacks from the backs of their bicycles. When the session ends the team are ushered through the grass, past the crowds and back on to the coach. Day two: evening The bus makes a quick stop at the hotel to offload the players before taking Frank Arnesen on to the Anjalay stadium, in the north of the island, where a triangular under-17 tournament is taking place. Each young player is hoping to impress Tottenham's soon-to-be-suspended sporting director, renowned for his ability to scout players, including Ronaldo in 1994 when he was at PSV Eindhoven. 'I love it,'Arnesen says from the stands. 'Especially watching young players, you see the dream in them, it's beautiful.' Team sheet in hand, he makes frequent annotations against the names of a number of individuals. 'I usually begin with 10 players in mind, then I narrow it down to five, and then down to the last two,' he explains. Only one young player will be given the chance to travel to the Spurs academy for a six-week placement. To Arnesen's right sits the elderly coach of the national team, clutching a copy of the original Mauritius v Tottenham Hotspur matchday programme from 1974. Arnesen calls out numbers to the nodded approval of the old coach. 'White number nine. And I like blue number 17.' The spectators around him strain to catch his expert observations. 'I think I will take red number nine, the smallest of them all,' he decides. 'I could have chosen one of the bigger fellows, but he was quick with his head as well as his feet. He took a throw-in and took it correctly, his first touch and his dribble. Those are small things, but he did them naturally.' After shaking the hand of each hopeful and presenting him with a Tottenham insignia pen, pin badge and key-ring, Arnesen sits the boys down for a quick team talk. He explains that he will only be announcing the successful candidate at tomorrow's match, but thanks them all for their efforts on the field. 'The most important thing is to enjoy playing,' he says. 'To really enjoy playing you have to be good at it and to be good at it you have to enjoy it. And if you are no good at it you will never really enjoy it.' Driving back to the hotel, Arnesen begins a detailed analysis of his scouting technique. 'You look for tactical awareness, not just for skill. You look for the mentality, how the player acts when he is playing well, and most importantly how he is when he is playing badly. He can either go down or he can fight to improve. Often players will start moaning at the referee, or their team-mates. They will stop running just because things are not going their way. 'Character is important, although even a player who is very lazy but has a lot of skill can still be fantastic. They can be an arsehole, selfish in a team game, but still make a great footballer. Romario is a good example. There were times when he didn't train for three days, but he still scored nearly a goal a game. Midfield players are different though, they need to be strong leaders with a social mentality. They are not always stars, but they know their work is important. Like Makelele, for example. At Real Madrid he made the big stars play well. He didn't need to play 'show' football, he only took the ball when he needed to and played it at the right time: pap, pap.' For Arnesen, scouting for players is not just about spotting new talent. 'It's about good planning for the team. A young team like Tottenham you look for a leader, you need experienced players, like Noureddine Naybet for instance. He is the piece in the puzzle that makes other players better.' The young No 9 who Arnesen chose had talent enough to stand out in the tournament, but travelling to a far away country and culture doesn't always come naturally. Just as Mbulelo Mabizela discovered. The talented Kaizer Chiefs defender, picked up on Tottenham's visit to South Africa in 2003, found settling in a new environment an unpredictable challenge. 'You can have a brilliant player who will never adapt because of homesickness,' says Arnesen. That is the most difficult part of scouting - you can never actually know what is in a player's head, they don't even know themselves until they experience it. You have to calculate the risk: if you pay £10 million the risk should be very low and if he is already from the same country and culture then it is even lower. But look at Ronaldo. I had him when he was 17 and he couldn't have cared less whether he was in Holland or Brazil, he just wanted to be the best player in the world. You just can't know. If everything was predictable in life then it would be boring.' Day three: morning Time for the players to relax in the luxurious grounds of the Meridien hotel. Most of the team are due to catch early flights home the following morning to join their respective international squads, and they are making the most of their limited leisure time. 'It's a beautiful island,' says Kelly, who clearly has a wider perspective than many Premiership footballers. 'But it's pretty run down in some areas. I've been to a few African countries where it's quite similar. You come out here to the beach and it's totally different. It's almost like a world of its own around the hotel, but the towns and cities are full of little shacks. 'If I could stay longer I'd try and see the island a bit more, do some more charity work. It'd be easy to go and help out a bit but we haven't had much time. It's so important to visit under-developed countries where you can do a bit more, give a bit to the community.' Kelly has been with Tottenham since he was 16, when he left home in Dublin. Five years later he is one of the success stories, a regular in the first-team. Kelly counts himself lucky. 'You get to see the world and that's something to be proud of on its own,' he says. 'It's such a great opportunity to see everywhere. Like on this trip, we've been able to go out a bit, and it's not all football-based.' Andy Reid, on his first tour with the club after signing from Nottingham Forest in January, sits on a wall overlooking the sea as beach sellers stroll past, interrupting to sell their wares. One wears a Tottenham shirt from the 1996-97 season. 'Stephen Carr's brother gave it to me when he visited Mauritius,' he insists. 'He's my favourite Tottenham player.' 'He's at Newcastle now,' Reid says with a wry smile, leaving the beach seller as dejected as the Jamie Redknapp fan. 'People really love their football here,' says Reid. 'You can see it in their faces. It's the kind of thing people back home take for granted. What annoys me is when you see people back home leaving football matches with 10 or 15 minutes to go. If you didn't want to watch the match then why go in the first place? It's ridiculous, and considering the amount of money they've spent on their tickets. I don't think you'll get anyone leaving early tonight.' Reflecting on the previous day's visit to the school, Reid softens. 'The kids were so good I couldn't believe it. Back home you'd have them all being cheeky and not doing what you asked them, but those kids were just delighted to have us there. Kids back home are probably spoilt, they can go and watch a Premiership game week in week out, whereas the kids here don't get things like this all the time. I always like coaching kids, I've got a daughter myself.' Defoe and Anthony Gardner are at the far end of the pool. A member of the hotel staff strolls past and Defoe leaps up to shake his hand. 'This one here's a quality player,' Defoe grins. 'Fancy another game of beach football after the match tonight?' Defoe and the others had played a seven-a-side game against the locals the previous evening. 'I'm still knackered,' he complains. 'You see how small the goals are? You can imagine how hard it was to score, it took us about an hour just to get one in. If I could I'd just play football all day long though.' The conversation moves on to plane journeys - and crashes. 'And they say put your seat belt on?' says Defoe, incredulous. 'If they had parachutes everybody could just jump out the plane. People say that planes come down horizontally. You always think that the nose would come down first but it doesn't. That's just what it does in films. 'But I loved that film on the plane on the way over, Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events . Amazing. I love watching Christmas films, like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , and Annie .' Day three: the big match The team bus edges through the milling crowds into the Anjalay stadium in the afternoon an hour-and-a-half before kick-off. A match is already under way between two local women's teams as the Tottenham side file into their dilapidated dressing room. There are concerns about the condition of the pitch and the amount of garlic in the pre-match pasta. 'Does anyone have any chewing gum?' Defoe asks. There's also some confusion as to who Tottenham's opponents will be. 'I heard they've got one or two Premiership players coming over,' says Kelly. 'I don't know whether it's true or not but there are loads of rumours flying around the camp.' The Mauritian papers have been filled with talk of Nicolas Anelka, Sylvain Distin and Laurent Robert all turning up to play for the national side. Around the ground there is evidence of Mauritian football's troubled past. Rainbow-coloured terracing, to invoke the multicultural harmony of the island, is offset by barbed wire and cctv cameras. On the other side of one fenced section stands Chris Smith, one of the travelling Spurs contingent. 'I haven't missed a game in four years, since I was 18,' he says. 'I work three jobs: one in a factory packing boxes of food to be sent on airlines and two in restaurants. I work about 78 hours a week so I can follow Spurs. I don't know what I'll do when the new working hours come in.' The stadium is still only two thirds full because the £4 ticket price is too high for many locals, whose monthly income averages £100. Team sheets are distributed - showing no Premiership players in the Mauritius side. The muddled state of the national team has left the MSA players from London in doubt as to whether they will play that evening. Tottenham find an alternative solution. 'Last night we were walking down from the bar,' says Vissen Appadu from the MSA team. 'And we started talking to Martin Jol about the game. That's how two of us - in the end it was Eric and Roy - ended up on the Spurs' bench.' Later Roy would say, 'Pure fantasy. That's what football dreams are made of. From fans, to sitting on the bench, to training to being in the changing room afterwards with the players. It was just unbelievable.' Appadu had a run-out for Mauritius. Fearful of injuries, Tottenham play tentatively. The ball bobbles on a poor surface and the standard of football suffers. An error by the Mauritius goalkeeper, Nicolas Doro, allows Robbie Keane to score the first goal. Young striker Lee Barnard - 17 goals in 17 games last season for the reserves - comes on as substitute and scores the second and final goal of the match. After the whistle as the Tottenham players hold their 'Friendship' trophy aloft, Mauritian fans with flags and photo phones surround them on the pitch. The players are led to their dressing room and the crowds move to the stadium entrance to wait. Before an escape route can be engineered there is time for a rapidly staged press conference. Arnesen wanders across the back of the conference room. 'Three points,' he jokes before taking his seat. Fans and bystanders cram into the room and those unable to gain access peer in through a window. For Taurah it is another opportunity to outline his vision for Mauritian football and explain his role in Tottenham's visit. For the Mauritian press, it is an chance to express dissatisfaction at the result. 'You may not be satisfied,' Martin Jol replies, 'but we are.' The players are led through the hubbub and on to the bus where they sign autographs and struggle to pass balls and shirts through the tiny windows to the outstretched arms below before moving off. 'It would have been nice to stay longer,' says Defoe. 'But it's been good to be with all the boys, just having a laugh. 'I was speaking to one of my mates on the phone the other day and was moaning a bit and he said: \"What are you moaning for? You're going to Mauritius. How can you moan about that?\" He's right. You can't.' Day four: afternoon With most of the squad departed and the sporting schedule all but over, a box has been reserved at the racecourse. Mauritians are renowned for their love of gambling and the biggest attraction by far is a Sunday afternoon at the races. The previous evening's match drew around 10,000 and local matches rarely draw more than 100. Champ de Mars racecourse is filled with more than 30,000 punters. The course is at the foot of the Moka Mountains, in downtown Port Louis. Thousands swarm to the centre of the course where they climb fences and market stalls for the best viewing position. This is where Saleem Golam, one of the most improved jockeys in British racing and the son of Mauritian ex-pats living in London, first fell in love with racing. Overlooking the finish line, a long colonial building forms the 'first class' area where the Tottenham party gather. Behind this building is an enclosed courtyard accommodating the bookmakers who operate out of tiny red-roofed huts. Taurah is busy. Not only are Tottenham and Imbel Travel sponsoring a race each, but there is a lot of betting to be done and he races back and forth through the chaos providing tips. Martin Jol soon takes charge and slips down to the stables to recruit his own advisers, whose advice helps him win a few rupees. The afternoon softens the blow of another early start and a 12-hour flight home. Day five: evening Down a bumpy dirt road, just a 10-minute drive from the hotel is someone with first-hand experience of the decline of Mauritian football. In a small bungalow, home to international goalkeeper Nicolas Doro, his wife, twin daughters and hundreds of giant mosquitos, there are framed pictures of huddled teams posing in packed stadiums. 'I don't know if the crowds will ever return,' says Doro. 'Every weekend they show matches from the Premiership and leagues like Spain and France. It's difficult for us. People are more interested in the Premiership than anything else. On Friday they came to see Tottenham, not Mauritius, to see Robbie Keane and Defoe.' Doro was on the bench for the Muslim Scouts during the 1999 match when the riots broke out. 'You didn't have to be Muslim to play for them,' he explains. 'It was just the fans. There was a big problem with communalism: Muslims, Indians, Christians - they all had their own teams. They always clashed, the fans were always fighting.' 'It was a very hot atmosphere,' Doro says of the day. 'The fans were fighting, throwing seats at us on the pitch, burning things. It was horrible. They killed seven people.' In the aftermath, Doro admits, he thought about giving up football altogether. 'After the politicians banned it we could only play for the national team, not for clubs. And we couldn't play in Mauritius, so we had no fans.' As football is semi-professional, Doro works full-time as a clerk for Mauritius Telecom as well as playing for local side Pamplemousse. He earns around £100 a month from football, with win bonuses of £10. 'The system is now regionalised,' he explains. 'We play for the place we live. The atmosphere is very different: we might have five or 10 people watching now in a big stadium. It's not like before when you had people coming to watch, when you would raise the level of your game.' While Tottenham return to international duty, controversy over Arnesen, and the high-pressured world of the Premiership, life in Mauritius carries on as before. Would Tottenham's visit make any difference? 'For the long term,' Doro says, 'it doesn't really help our national game. But it was a dream to play against them. They were on another level. I hope the experience will help us improve our game, help us grow.'",
        "debiased_text": "Michael Dawson runs out of the sea, shouting, 'I'm not going back in there!' and waving his hands as he shows the size of the creature he claims to have seen. His teammates, who are on sun loungers, are amused. This is 'down time,' a rare opportunity for the players to relax during Tottenham's off-season tour in Mauritius. Summer tours have become common among football clubs, with teams such as Manchester United, Arsenal, Real Madrid, Manchester City, and Chelsea also taking similar trips. Tottenham's visit to the tropical island has generated interest from other clubs. José Mourinho expressed curiosity about the trip when he was heading to Seoul. These tours are primarily for financial reasons, utilizing the spending power of fans outside of Europe. Tottenham has visited Mauritius before, during a trip in 1974 when Bill Nicholson was the manager. At that time, local football matches could fill stadiums. However, since the Premiership has become more popular, local interest has shifted. In 1999, an 18-month ban on competitive sport was imposed on the island, due to football-related violence connected to racial and religious divisions among clubs. A match between Muslim Scouts and Fire Brigade led to three days of rioting and the death of seven people. During the ban, only the national team was allowed to play, with 'home' matches taking place on the neighboring island of Reunion. When the league was reformed, new clubs were established on a regional basis, resulting in decreased support for local teams in favor of the Premiership. Across the island, club badges appear on homes and signs are mounted on trees. The most popular teams among locals include Manchester United, Arsenal, and Liverpool, with a visit from Tottenham possibly increasing the prominence of the local team. The trip, sponsored by Air Mauritius, was arranged in collaboration with travel agent Suresh Taurah, who has been living in the Tottenham area of London since 1968. As an expatriate Mauritian, he promotes the Mauritian Sports Association (MSA) who compete in the Middlesex County Premier League, with the goal of serving as a feeder for the national team. As part of the cultural exchange, he brought four players from the MSA team to compete against Tottenham in the tour's main event. Day one: afternoon The players arrive at Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam international airport after a 12-hour flight. The airport is full of local fans wearing Manchester United shirts, and Taurah is giving them garlands. Local media and fans gather on the team bus for interviews and autographs, which the players are willing to provide. The players check into their hotel and a press call is scheduled. The local media and fans are somewhat unsure of what to ask the eight-man panel that includes Frank Arnesen, Martin Jol, Ledley King, and others. After a few questions, the local media appear to sit in silence. Jermain Defoe comments on the questioning, noting that in England, the press would have asked many more questions. Day two: morning The players arrive at a school, where the event is dubbed 'Christmas at the Rose Belle school.' Despite the rain, children are dressed in specially manufactured multi-coloured Tottenham baseball caps and blow plastic horns in an attempt to greet the players. The players train with the children, which is also attended by some fans who have traveled from abroad. The crowd is large, and the training is less formal due to the conditions. During the session, some of the players struggle with the local language. The training eventually turns into an autograph session. Michael Brown is surrounded by fans, handing out autographs while on a plastic foot cast. Even the injured players participate in the training and other events, seeing it as a team bonding opportunity. Defoe interacts with young participants, showing his appreciation for their performance. At the end of the session, the players appear to be disappointed with the short time they spent with the children. Day two: evening The team bus arrives at the Anjalay stadium in the north of the island for a triangular under-17 tournament. The sporting director, Frank Arnesen, is present and notes the potential of young players. The stadium's atmosphere reflects the legacy of the island's football history. Arnesen's discussions with the young players focus on performance, effort, and attitude. He comments on the challenging nature of scouting, since it involves not only identifying talent but also judging character and adaptability. Day three: morning The players have an opportunity to relax at the Meridien hotel. Some players are preparing to return to their respective international squads. Stephen Kelly, a Tottenham player, reflects on the contrast between the hotel and the surrounding areas of the island. He comments on the opportunity for cultural experiences and charity work. Andy Reid, on his first tour with the club, shares his observations on the local football culture. Defoe and Anthony Gardner engage with the hotel staff and reflect on activities like plane crashes and beach football. Day three: the big match The team bus arrives at Anjalay stadium for the match an hour and a half before kick-off. A game between two local women's teams is already underway. There are concerns about the quality of the pitch and the garlic in the pasta before the game. There is also some confusion about the identity of Tottenham's opponents. Local newspapers reported rumors about players such as Nicolas Anelka, Sylvain Distin, and Laurent Robert joining the national team. The stadium's infrastructure reflects the history of football in Mauritius, with some areas still displaying remnants of the nation's past challenges. A member of the local Mauritian Sports Association, Vissen Appadu, ends up on the Tottenham bench after speaking with Martin Jol. Roy Woodward, a long-time fan of Tottenham, travels from Edmonton to watch the match and comments on the cost of entry for many locals, whose average monthly income is £100. The match goes ahead and is played with Tottenham taking a cautious approach. Robbie Keane scores the first goal, and a substitute, Lee Barnard, scores the second. After the match, the players are surrounded by local fans and media. A press conference is held, during which Martin Jol addresses the outcome and confirms the team's satisfaction with the performance. The players leave the stadium, signing autographs for the fans from the bus. Day four: afternoon With the majority of the squad returning home, the final event is a visit to the Champ de Mars racecourse. The railway line to the racecourse is filled with thousands of punters. The racecourse is a popular venue for locals, who are known for their betting activities. Taurah is involved in the betting aspect, offering advice to those in the crowd. Martin Jol also participates in full by attending the stables to recruit experts for the event. This is the last significant event before the players begin their journey back to England. Day five: evening Tottenham's visit draws attention to the ongoing challenges of local football in Mauritius. Nicolas Doro, a local goalkeeper, lives in a small bungalow with limited resources and shares his perspective on the state of football in his country. He reflects on the past, recalling the 1999 riots that led to an 18-month sports ban. After the ban, club football was only available for the national team, with locals unable to watch matches in their home country. Despite the current regionalized system, the interest in local football remains low, with the public preferring to watch foreign leagues. Doro works as a clerk for Mauritius Telecom and earns part of his income from football, which includes bonuses for wins. He comments on the difficulty of rekindling the former passion for local football, but still hopes that the interaction with a top-tier team like Tottenham might offer some inspiration to local players."

Geoff Dyer andRichard McGregor report: [ASIA EDITION]; Delicate balancing skills needed to control China's property boom: A slowdown in prices would be welcome but a sharp fall disastrous, saddling banks with new bad loans and destroying families' savings. Geoff Dyer andRichard McGregor report:   [ASIA EDITION ]",
        "original_text": "In the space of only a few years, the Pudong financial district has become Shanghai's most famous image, with its TV tower and the world's tallest hotel vying for attention with the neon-lit signs of capitalist titans. Look a bit further south, however, and the view is not so eye- catching. The skyline is still crammed with high-rise buildings, but only a few lights on some towers are visible, a tell-tale sign that many new luxury apartments in Pudong are empty. Shanghai, China's commercial capital, has become a lightning rod for the central government's concerns about a swelling property bubble in many cities, especially along the affluent coast. After trying with little success to cool the market by squeezing lending, Beijing more recently delivered a edict to the mayors of these cities: get your property markets under control or lose your jobs. But bringing the property market under control requires a delicate balancing act. A slowdown in prices would be welcome but a sharp fall disastrous, saddling Chinese banks with large wads of new bad loans and destroying the savings of many families. \"Both a rapid rise and a rapid fall will get officials sacked,\" says Ren Zhiqiang, of the Huayuan property company, in Beijing. \"The officials will be more worried than the developers if that happens.\" Mr Ren says a slowdown is already apparent in Beijing, in spite of the huge construction under way in the city in readiness for the 2008 Olympics. \"Many buyers are waiting for prices to fall,\" he says. For the past two months anecdotal evidence suggests the campaign is starting to work in Shanghai as well, with prices cooling following the imposition of a speculative gains tax and a ban on re- selling flats until mortgages have been repaid. Ever since the Shanghai city government announced in the early 1990s its plan to develop the largely farmland area of Pudong into one of the world's financial centres, critics have predicted imminent disaster. Yet the buildings kept on going up, making Pudong the epicentre of a boom that saw prices rise 28 per cent in the city centre last year and many apartments triple in value in as many years. With a weak stock market and low interest rates, property is one of the few investments available for ordinary Chinese. Foreigners have also poured in, especially from Taiwan and Hong Kong, some hoping to benefit from a revaluation of the renminbi. Investors have even bought office space in Pudong that they did not bother to let out because they were focusing only on the potential capital gain. But assessing the state of the market has always been made difficult by the disconnection between official statistics and what military strategists like to call \"the facts on the ground\". According to the Shanghai statistics bureau, only 2.7 per cent of the properties in the city are empty. However, the residential areas of Pudong reveal a different story. Five minutes from the financial district, the Summit Residence is a new, luxury development of 909 flats. A year after they were finished, Albert Zhao of Zhonghai Property Management Company, which runs the complex, reckons about 50 per cent of the flats are occupied, even though the complex has been largely sold. Andy Mei at the nearby 21st Century estate agents says the 50 per cent figure is good for the area. \"It is normal for around here,\" he says. Such factors led one senior Chinese academic, Yi Xianrong at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, to predict the Shanghai market could fall by 50 per cent. However, a large proportion of empty properties does not necessarily mean demand has been artificial, or that prices will inevitably collapse. Yin Kuanghua, director of the property research centre of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, says there are many reasons why properties might be kept empty. Many Chinese living abroad have bought properties in Shanghai in the hope of returning there, once they have made enough money. \"As Chinese, their root is here. And it's reasonable for them to buy such properties here,\" he says. \"Some rich Chinese collect paintings and calligraphy or antiques to hedge against inflation. That applies to property investors too. They don't rent the flats but just keep them.\" Property experts caution that the Shanghai market is very segmented and the current weakness is concentrated in the luxury end. The demand for low-cost housing remains strong, they say. Lawrence Wu, managing director of Shui On Land's commercial division, says he sees little signs of weakness. \"One of my salesmen got a call at 2am in the morning from a customer asking where he had to queue up the next day to bid for a property,\" he says.",
        "debiased_text": "In a short period of time, the Pudong financial district has become one of the most recognizable areas of Shanghai, known for its TV tower and the world's tallest hotel. Further south, the skyline is also filled with high-rise buildings, although only a small number of lights from these structures are visible, indicating that many newly developed luxury apartments are unoccupied. Shanghai, considered China's commercial capital, has drawn attention from the central government regarding concerns over a growing property bubble in various cities, especially along the coastal regions. The government has attempted to manage the market by restricting lending, and more recently, issued instructions to city mayors to regulate their property markets or risk consequences for their positions. Regulating the property market requires a careful balance; a gradual slowdown in prices is acceptable, but a sharp decline could lead to significant financial issues, including increasing bad loans for Chinese banks and affecting family savings.\n\nRen Zhiqiang from the Huayuan property company in Beijing states that both a rapid price increase and a decrease can lead to officials being removed from their positions, and that officials may be more concerned about this than developers. Ren notes that a slowdown in prices is already visible in Beijing despite extensive construction projects preparing for the 2008 Olympics. He adds that many buyers are currently waiting for potential price reductions.\n\nAnecdotal evidence over the past two months suggests that a similar trend is emerging in Shanghai following the introduction of a speculative gains tax and a ban on reselling flats before mortgage repayments are completed. Since the 1990s, the Shanghai government has been developing the Pudong area, which was mostly farmland, into a major financial hub. Despite predictions of potential problems from critics, construction continued, transforming Pudong into a focal point of economic growth, with property prices increasing by 28 per cent in the city center last year and some apartments tripling in value over the same period.\n\nWith a weak stock market and low interest rates, property remains a popular investment among Chinese citizens. Additionally, foreigners, particularly from Taiwan and Hong Kong, have invested heavily in Shanghai's real estate, some of whom are hopeful for future currency revaluations. Some investors have purchased office spaces in Pudong without immediately renting them out, as they are prioritizing potential capital gains.\n\nThere are discrepancies between official statistics and the actual market conditions. According to the Shanghai statistics bureau, only 2.7 per cent of the properties in the city are vacant. However, residential areas in Pudong display a different picture. The Summit Residence, a new luxury development with 909 flats, has an estimated occupancy rate of about 50 per cent a year after completion, according to Albert Zhao of Zhonghai Property Management Company, which manages the complex.\n\nAndy Mei from the nearby 21st Century estate agents considers the 50 per cent occupancy rate typical for the area. Senior Chinese academic Yi Xianrong from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has predicted a potential 50 per cent decline in the Shanghai property market.

The same applies to property investors; they keep the flats rather than rent them out.\"\n\nProperty experts indicate that the Shanghai market is highly segmented, with current weakness primarily observed in the luxury housing segment.

        "title": "Paralysis patients take a chance ; Experts question Chinese surgeon's fetus-cell treatment: [FINAL Edition]",
        "original_text": "BEIJING -- In January 2004, Kim Allen suddenly began having trouble turning the key in her car's ignition. All too quickly, a spreading weakness slurred her speech and limited her ability to walk.\nAfter two failed surgeries, endless trips to the doctor and eight months of steady deterioration, she was diagnosed with the incurable nerve illness known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The doctors told the 49- year-old native of Sioux City, Iowa, that she had no more than 18 months to live.\nBut then Allen learned of Huang Hongyun, a Chinese neurosurgeon who performs an experimental surgical procedure on patients with spinal cord injuries or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the formal name for Lou Gehrig's disease. Huang's controversial technique, using cells from aborted fetuses, is not available in the USA, and medical experts say there is no scientific evidence that it works.\nA desperate Allen brushed aside those concerns. \"This was the only chance I had,\" she says. \"I was determined to come here to see if it would help me.\"\nAllen is among dozens of seriously ill Americans who have gambled on an unproven medical procedure in a country better known for its plastic toys than for the quality of its health care. \"Americans are the laboratory rats\" in Huang's program, says Barth Green, president of the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, which is affiliated with the University of Miami.\nThe Chinese doctor says he has operated on about 500 spinal cord patients and 200 others with ALS. About one-quarter were Americans. During her surgery April 19, Allen received only a local anesthetic before Huang drilled two holes in her skull. The surgeon then injected 2 million cells harvested from the nasal linings of aborted second-trimester fetuses into her frontal lobe.\nWithin days of the 45-minute procedure, Allen says, she felt tangible improvement. \"I can smack my lips for the first time in eight months,\" she says. \"It sounds like a simple thing, but when it's something you can't do ...\"\n'No scientific evidence'\nSkeptical doctors back home aren't convinced. They say Huang doesn't keep track of his patients, so no one knows how many experience lasting benefits. And they say he has failed to perform the controlled studies that could verify anecdotal reports of improvement.\n\"We don't know why what's happening is happening. ... We want the data. Unfortunately, the data doesn't exist,\" says Maura Hofstadter, director of education and scientific liaison at the Reese-Irvine Research Center in Irvine, Calif., which studies spinal cord injuries.\nThe Miami Project sent a team of doctors to Huang's clinic about six months ago, but they came away unimpressed, Green says. \"There really was no scientific evidence to substantiate that this was a safe or effective treatment.\"\nGreen says he offered to pay for a second team to spend six months to one year in Beijing performing a scientific study of Huang's work, but Huang opted to expand his practice to eight medical centers rather than accept the offer.\nInterviewed at his clinic in Beijing's Fragrant Hills area, Huang, 50, grows visibly exasperated. The clinic lacks the money and manpower to follow every patient. Any objections to his work stem from a cultural bias against Chinese methods, he says. \"It's discrimination. They don't really know what I'm doing. It's just nonsense.\"\nHe refuses to disclose his compensation, though in December he told a British newspaper, The Guardian, that he received a flat $500 monthly salary no matter how many operations he did.\nIn defiance of the experts' doubts, Huang's ward is full of patients from the USA and Europe; his waiting list extends into 2007. Reflecting his global appeal, the waiting-room wall clocks read New York, London, Paris, Moscow, Tokyo and Beijing.\nGoal is to prolong life\nThe clean, well-lit facility is a world apart from the slightly grubby state-owned medical center one floor below. As if to underscore the separation, a uniformed guard restricts entrance.\nHuang's patients praise the care they receive at a facility the doctor charitably likens to a \"five-star hotel.\" During a recent visit, the staff seemed plentiful and attentive. \"It's very good,\" Allen says. \"They come in and check on you all the time.\"\nStill, because of a scheduling mix-up, no one was at the airport to meet Allen and her husband, Joe, on April 17 when they arrived from the USA. And while she waited for a room to become available, she spent an entire day parked in a wheelchair.\nIn an interview in his office, Huang, a broad-faced man with neat black hair, betrays a slightly harried air. A flat-screen computer monitor and two speakers occupy his desk. The only decor is a wall- mounted map of the world.\nHuang spent three years researching the use of fetal cells at Rutgers University and New York University before returning to Beijing in 2000. Earlier, he worked in remote Xinjiang province in western China and a military hospital in Beijing.\nA licensed neurosurgeon in China but not in the USA, Huang experimented on rats before beginning the surgery on humans in October 2001. He is careful not to promise too much. \"This is not a cure,\" he says.\nIndeed, Huang concedes he can't explain how the fetal tissue -- called olfactory ensheathing cells -- might work on damaged brains and spinal cords. The cells have a unique ability to perpetually regenerate. But the progress reported by spinal cord patients, for example, occurs too quickly to represent regeneration of damaged nerves.\nGreen says patients may feel temporary improvement because the operation eases pressure on the spinal cord or eliminates harmful scar tissue.\nResults vary for each person. Because victims of spinal cord injuries can generally remain stable without treatment, Huang aims to improve their quality of life. After the two- to three-hour surgery, some patients are able to breathe without a ventilator. Others regain control of urination and sexual function, Huang says.\nFor victims of the progressive, fatal ALS, Huang's goal is simply staving off the inevitable. \"Right now, our methods can only make them survive a little longer: one month, a few months, one year,\" he says. \"But this result is much better than nothing.\"\nHuang's patients are willing to take the chance. Almost all come here over the objections of their personal physicians, who worry that the experimental treatment might be a scam. Because insurance does not cover such unproven techniques, each must raise privately the $20,000 treatment fee plus thousands more for travel. (Huang charges $7,000 to $8,000 for Chinese citizens.)\nAllen's friends raffled off a Ford Focus and held a spaghetti supper and pancake breakfast to help.\nBut perhaps what attracts the most debate in the USA is Huang's use of cells from aborted fetuses.\nSandy Gullett's husband, Roger, 55, a circuit court clerk in Kentucky, hasn't spoken for a year after being diagnosed with ALS. Sandy, 50, who describes the couple as \"Christian people,\" says the origin of the cells used in her husband's surgery April 20 posed a moral dilemma.\n\"We prayed about that. We talked to other Christians,\" she says, sitting by her husband's side. \"It's a way of taking something bad that's happening and maybe making something good out of it.\"\nBefore coming to China, many patients, including Allen, were offered the chance to participate in experimental treatment programs in the USA. But federal regulations require that some participants receive the potentially lifesaving treatment being studied, while those in a control group receive no treatment or a harmless placebo.\nThe aim is to make sure that proposed innovations are safe and effective before they are widely used. For Allen, however, that meant a high-stakes choice. She could gamble on receiving medicine in a Mayo Clinic trial -- or on Huang.\nShe chose China. \"I wanted to be able to talk better and walk better and get my strength back,\" she says. \"I lost a brother to ALS 15 years ago, and at that time they didn't have anything like this.\"\nStill, the absence of data means that American doctors can't be sure whether any improvement is the result of the fetal cells, the patient's belief that the treatment will help, or some other unknown factor.\n\"We do find his work interesting and potentially promising. But there isn't any current published data supporting his work,\" says Jennifer Brand, director of chapter-patient services for the ALS Association in Calabasas Hills, Calif.\nNo controlled trials\nHuang has published articles in professional journals that are little known outside China, including the Chinese Medical Journal and the Chinese Journal of Clinical Rehabilitation. While both are regarded here as reputable, peer-reviewed journals, they are less prestigious than Western publications, says Zhang Hongde of Peking Union Medical College's publishing house. \"The top articles usually go to the foreign medical journals,\" he says.\nHuang bristles when asked about his failure to perform controlled trials, which could involve operating on patients without giving them the fetal cells. He says such \"sham surgery\" is unethical. \"I hate to discuss this. I think it is a stupid question. I'm not allowed to do this by Chinese law.\"\nBut his refusal to comply with standard scientific practice guarantees that the criticism will continue.\n\"He's in an environment that's scientifically unsophisticated. There's no control. You can do whatever you want,\" Green says. \"What he's doing is wrong.\"",

He did not disclose his compensation for the procedure, though he mentioned in an earlier interview with The Guardian that he receives a flat $500 monthly salary, regardless of the number of operations performed.\n\nDespite the doubts, the clinic in Beijing's Fragrant Hills area is attracting patients from various parts of the world, with a waiting list extending into 2007. Patients report receiving good care and praising the staff's attentiveness, describing the facility as comparable to a 'five-star hotel.' During a recent visit, the clinic appeared to have adequate staffing and resources. However, due to a scheduling issue, no one was present at the airport to greet Allen and her husband when they arrived from the USA. Allen spent a day in a wheelchair while waiting for a room to become available.\n\nHuang, a licensed neurosurgeon in China but not in the United States, conducted research on the use of fetal cells at institutions including Rutgers University and New York University before returning to China in 2000. He performed experiments on rats prior to beginning human trials in October 2001. Huang emphasizes that this procedure is not a cure and is uncertain about the exact mechanism by which the olfactory ensheathing cells from aborted fetuses may exert any effect on damaged nervous tissue.\n\nHuang reports that some patients have experienced benefits following the surgery, such as the ability to breathe without a ventilator or regaining control of urination and sexual function. For ALS patients, he aims to prolong life, stating that his methods can provide survival extensions ranging from one month to a year. Patients are generally aware that outcomes vary, and improvements may also be influenced by factors unrelated to the treatment itself.\nThe procedure is not covered by insurance, so each patient must personally cover the $20,000 treatment fee, in addition to expenses for travel. Huang charges $7,000 to $8,000 for Chinese citizens.\n\nThe use of cells from aborted fetuses has drawn significant attention and debate in the United States. Roger Gullett, a 55-year-old circuit court clerk from Kentucky who has not spoken for a year after an ALS diagnosis, received the treatment alongside his wife, Sandy. The couple described the issue as a moral dilemma, given their Christian beliefs, but expressed hope that the treatment could yield positive outcomes.\n\nPrior to traveling to China, Allen had been offered the possibility of participating in similar experimental treatment programs in the United States. However, federal regulations necessitate that some participants receive the treatment under study and others receive a placebo or no treatment, to ensure safety and effectiveness. For Allen, this offered an alternative gamble: either participate in a trial at the Mayo Clinic or pursue treatment in China. She opted for the latter, citing a personal connection to the disease, as her brother had died of ALS 15 years earlier.\n\nThe lack of published data and controlled trials presenting objective results makes it difficult for American medical professionals to determine whether patients' improvements are due to the treatment, placebo effect, or other variables. Huang has published articles in professional journals based in China, such as the Chinese Medical Journal and the Chinese Journal of Clinical Rehabilitation. While these journals are considered reputable within China, they are not as widely recognized as Western medical publications, according to Zhang Hongde of Peking Union Medical College's publishing house.\n\nWhen questioned about conducting controlled trials, which would involve performing surgeries without administering the fetal cells, Huang stated that he finds the idea unethical due to legal restrictions in China. His refusal to implement standard scientific controls has led to ongoing criticism from medical experts who note the lack of scientific rigor in his practice."

Andrew Yeh reports: [LONDON 1ST EDITION]; Chinese couples find breaking up is not so hard to do: The divorce rate is rising as the legal process becomes more straightforward and the social stigma declines. Andrew Yeh reports:   [LONDON 1ST EDITION ]",
        "original_text": "Mr Su, a 30-something IT worker in Beijing, last month divorced his wife of five years. She had been his college sweetheart but he had fallen in love with a younger co-worker. Even though he feels bad for his wife and sorry that his parents and in-laws are upset, he is relieved that the new process for getting divorced in China means that what is essentially a private matter remained private. \"I'm very depressed about the divorce,\" he said. \"I hope others, especially young people, don't follow our actions.\" In previous generations the situation would have been very different. Had Mr Su wanted to divorce, he would have needed letters of certification from his work unit and the matter would have been the subject of local discussion. A marriage registration clerk in Beijing's Xicheng district was recently quoted as saying in a Chinese newspaper that \"opposition from parents, gossip from neighbours and colleagues, and division of property - all these problems could put people off (divorcing), not to mention the interference of work units or neighbourhood committees\". With stringent family and social pressures, the common way to deal with a failed or arranged marriage in the past was simply to stay in it. That is no longer the case. Both the social, and legal, dynamics of marriage in China are changing. The number of divorces rose 21 per cent last year to 1.6m - still a low number per capita compared with some developed countries but a number that is fast on the rise - and some observers suggest that rate of increase will continue for the rest of the decade at least. In contrast the number of newly married couples last year only increased 2.8 per cent on the previous year. China's upward divorce rate is indicative of the greater personal freedoms and privacy that the country's citizens are being allowed. The rigid confines of marriage and family that existed for decades under a strict communist rule have in recent years been eroded, and many Chinese couples are now more willing to admit, and put an end to, a failed marriage. Wang Fang, a divorce lawyer in Beijing, knows all too well that her own family circumstances could have been very different had she grown up in today's China. \"If my parents had been of this era, they probably would have divorced,\" said the 32-year old Ms Wang. Her parents never formally separated despite their marriage failing because it was unacceptable during the 1980s and would have damaged their reputations within the Communist party. Ms Wang, who herself divorced last year after an eight-year marriage, handles between five and 10 divorce cases each month, giving her a first-hand view of marriage break-up in China. Most divorcees are aged between 30 and 45, the most common cause of a marriage breakdown is infidelity and the social stigma that was once attached is less onerous. In China today, it is also far less complicated to get divorced compared with even 10 years ago. It has become quicker and easier to legally annul a marriage and there are fewer socio-economic constraints to stay married. Since a new regulation was implemented in late 2003, divorces can now be carried out simply by having personal identification and marriage papers - there is no longer a need for letters from your workplace for instance; in essence it ensures greater privacy. The higher number of divorces is also attributable to China's social mores slowly changing. The concept of pursuing personal freedom and happiness over a stable married family life has become more common in Chinese society. Extramarital affairs, or suspicion of them, are frequent in China today. A hit television show called Chinese Style Divorce tells the story of a wife obsessively suspicious of her doctor husband. The show was about how loyalties can be constantly tested in a complex Chinese marriage. Chinese attitudes toward marriage are changing, especially among younger generations influenced by foreign cultures. \"In the positive sense, people are experiencing more and demanding more quality out of their marriages,\" said Ms Wang. \"If we are giving ourselves a better life, it's not a bad thing. \"But in another sense, there are inappropriate attitudes and views toward sexual freedom - and this can hurt one's spouse,\" she said, adding that in many of her cases, divorces are initiated by the men and the men are also involved in nearly all of the extramarital affairs. There is a Chinese saying about couples commonly \"sharing the same bed but having differing dreams\". That might have been appropriate a few years ago. Increasingly it is another proverb - \"a couple is like two birds in the same forest, and part from each other when there is a disaster\" - that is perhaps now more appropriate for unhappy Chinese couples.",
        "debiased_text": "Mr Su, a 30-something IT worker in Beijing, recently divorced his wife of five years. The couple was previously in a relationship during college, but Mr Su developed feelings for a younger co-worker. Despite expressing regret over the emotional impact on his wife and concerns about the reactions of his parents and in-laws, Mr. Su stated he felt relief that the current process for divorce in China ensures that such matters remain private. He described feeling depressed about the divorce and expressed a hope that others, especially younger individuals, would not follow the same path. In previous generations, divorcing would have required letters of certification from a work unit, and the process would have been subject to local discussion and social scrutiny. A marriage registration clerk in Beijing's Xicheng district recently stated in a Chinese newspaper that factors such as parental opposition, neighborly and colleague gossip, property division, and interference from work units or neighborhood committees could deter individuals from seeking a divorce. In the past, due to strong family and social pressures, it was common for couples in failing marriages to remain married. This is no longer the case, as both social and legal aspects of marriage in China have evolved. Last year, the number of divorces increased by 21 per cent, reaching 1.6 million. While this remains a relatively low figure per capita when compared to some developed countries, it is on an upward trajectory, with some observers predicting that the rate of increase will continue through the remainder of the decade. In contrast, the number of newly married couples last year saw a more modest 2.8 per cent increase compared to the previous year. The rise in divorce rates is reflective of the increasing personal freedoms and privacy granted to citizens. Over the years, the strict constraints on marriage and family life that existed under communist rule have lessened, making couples more open to admitting and ending a failed marriage. Wang Fang, a divorce lawyer in Beijing, noted that her family's circumstances might have been different had they lived in the current era. She mentioned that if her parents were from the present day, they would likely have considered divorce, as it was not an option during the 1980s due to the social stigma and the risk of damaging their reputations in the Communist party. Ms. Wang, who recently divorced after an eight-year marriage, handles between five and ten divorce cases per month. This provides her with a direct perspective on marriage dissolution in China. The majority of individuals seeking divorce are aged between 30 and 45, with infidelity being cited as the most common cause of marriage breakdown. Social stigma associated with divorce has also diminished. In China, the process of obtaining a divorce has become simpler and faster in recent years compared to a decade ago. A regulation introduced in late 2003 allows for divorce to be processed with just personal identification and marriage papers, eliminating the requirement for workplace letters. This change has contributed to greater privacy for individuals involved in divorce proceedings. The increased divorce rates also correlate with a gradual shift in societal values. An increasing number of people in China are prioritizing personal freedom and happiness over traditional ideals of a stable married family life. Extramarital affairs or the suspicion of them are reported to be more frequent in contemporary Chinese society. A popular television show titled 'Chinese Style Divorce' features a wife who is suspicious of her doctor husband and explores themes of tested loyalties within a complex marriage. Social attitudes toward marriage are changing, particularly among younger generations influenced by foreign cultures. Ms. Wang remarked that people are experiencing more and expecting higher quality in their marriages, which is a positive development. However, she also indicated that there are some inappropriate views emerging regarding sexual freedom, which can have negative consequences for a spouse. She added that in many of her cases, men initiate the divorce and are also involved in most instances of infidelity. A Chinese proverb states that couples commonly 'share the same bed but have differing dreams,' which might have been well-suited to describe past relationships. In recent years, another saying 'a couple is like two birds in the same forest, and part from each other when there is a disaster' has become increasingly relevant to describe unhappy couples."

        "original_text": "A manager from a minor branch of Bank of China, one of the mainland's \"big four\" state banks, has become one of the country's most wanted men. His case is the latest scandal to hit China's biggest banks and threaten their efforts to turn themselves into world-class lenders. Bank of China, which is preparing to list its shares on international markets, has implicated manager Gao Shan in a fraud case involving \"several hundred million yuan\" of deposits at a branch in Harbin, capital of northeastern Heilongjiang province. Such wrongdoing has rattled local regulators. \"Cases violating rules and law are still taking place,\" the China Banking Regulatory Commission said at the weekend. \"These cases involve huge sums of money, the plots are vile and the losses are relatively serious.\" The CBRC said recent scandals exposed \"lax internal management\" at some of China's state-controlled commercial banks, which were \"not observing rules, not investigating violations thoroughly and not punishing violators severely enough\". The scale of the Harbin scandal points at serious problems in Bank of China's internal controls, even as it extols its improved corporate governance to potential foreign investors. Police are searching for Mr Gao, who is believed to have fled abroad, and details of the Hesong branch case remain unclear. The scandal has affected some enterprises with ties to the branch, including the Shanghai-listed Northeast Expressway, which has filed suit against Bank of China claiming it is missing about Rmb293m (Dollars 35m) in deposits. Bank of China has been in damage control mode in recent days. It announced that an investigation team has been dispatched to the north-east, that it will conduct an internal review and reform its internal auditing and supervision operations. At a press conference last week, Wang Zhaowen, a Bank of China spokesman, downplayed concerns the scandal might have a big effect on the lender's overall business. A press release giving details of the bank's \"good financial results\" for 2004 was handed out at the meeting. An official with the Hesong branch has reported that business is continuing as usual. Unfortunately, tales of misconduct at regional bank operations are business as usual. Liu Jinbao, who headed Bank of China's Hong Kong unit, is facing a corruption trial on charges of embezzling more than Rmb41m from its operations in the city. Last April, US federal authorities handed over to Beijing a former Bank of China branch manager from the southern province of Guangdong. Yu Zhendong was accused of playing a leading role in swindling USDollars 485m from the bank in the 1990s. People accused of such crimes in China often get away before investigators can figure out what happened. A study released by the Ministry of Commerce last year estimated 4,000 corrupt officials have fled the country with some USDollars 50bn in the past 20 years. China's police ministry has estimated there are about 500 outstanding \"economic crime suspects\" living overseas. China has in recent years been stepping up work to get some of them back through co-operation with foreign governments. Such efforts sometimes pay off. The official Legal Daily reported on Friday that a joint operation between Russian and Chinese police had resulted in the arrest of an official from a township finance institution who had fled in November with more than Rmb9m embezzled over several years. He was caught just inside the Russian border in a public bathhouse.",

        "original_text": "The Toronto StockExchange plans to compete withlarger US and UK rivals to attract Chinese companies seeking capital to its market, its chief executive said last week. Richard Nesbitt, chairman and chief executive of the TSX Group, which operates the exchange, said the energy, mining and biotechnology sectors would be the main targets of a drive to attract new listings to the Canadian capital markets. \"We do more mining finance than anywhere in the world and we have more energy companies than any other market, and we're strong in biotech,\" Mr Nesbitt said in his first international news interview since taking up the post in December. \"We can compete with anyone in these areas.\" His statement comes amid heightened competition between larger competitors on both sides of the Atlantic for international listings - Chinese in particular. The New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq stock market and the London Stock Exchange are all pursuing foreign listings in a bid to increase their revenues. Currently, 18 Chinese companies are listed on the TSX, while the NYSE has 17 such listings and the Nasdaq has 10. Alongside new listings, the TSX aims to increase revenues from distributing data and building new markets for structured products, such as exchange-traded funds and income trusts, the Canadian equivalent of real-estate investment trusts. In addition, an equity derivatives market is planned for possible launch in March 2009, when a non-compete agreement with the Montreal Exchange ends. Mr Nesbitt expects sharp growth in derivatives markets, which are relatively underdeveloped in Canada. In the long run, the TSX Group is likely to follow the European model of exchanges offering trading across several asset classes, ranging from cash equities to futures, options and derivatives. Last year, it bought NGX, a leading exchange for natural gas and electricity futures, for CDollars 38m (USDollars 31.2m). Mr Nesbitt said acquisitions could be a part of the TSX's future but took a dim view of the opportunities available in the US following an unsuccessful attempt to buy a stake in Archipelago, the US electronic exchange. \"Some of the brands we see are not worth much,\" he said, questioning the Nasdaq's decision to buy Brut, an electronic marketplace, and to bid for Instinet, another electronic market. \"We won't pay only for order flow because these days order flow is very portable.\" The NYSE's plans and moves will dictate the outlook for the US market and by extension the TSX's plans, Mr Nesbitt said. While praising the Big Board as the world's best brand among exchanges, he cautioned that there was \"no future for floor-based, mutual exchanges\". The NYSE is deciding whether to become a for-profit company, while it awaits approval of landmark regulations for US stock markets and for reforms that would see its market become a hybrid of floor-based and automated trading. The TSX Group and Canadian stock exchanges have undergone a process many analysts say is long overdue in the US, where several regional exchanges are struggling to compete while other operators are gaining market share. The TSX's growth strategy follows a successful demutualisation in 2000, listing as a public company two years later. This came after the Toronto Stock Exchange had become the largest North American exchange to shut down its trading floor in the late 1990s, having introduced decimal trading a year earlier. In 1999, the Canadian Venture Exchange was formed by the Vancouver and Alberta stock exchanges, later joined by the equities side of the Montreal exchange. The exchange, a marketplace for younger, developing companies, was acquired by the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2001, and rebranded as TSX Venture a year later. Last year, the TSX Group had CDollars 295.6m in revenues, up 26 per cent, achieving net profits of CDollars 98.4m, up 29 per cent from 2003. The Toronto exchange attracted 204 new listings last year, of which 115 were initial public offerings. Its 1,421 listings have a capitalisation of CDollars 1,546bn and trade about 251.1m shares a day on average.",

He noted that the TSX has a significant presence in mining finance and energy companies, and is also strong in biotechnology. His comments were made against a backdrop of increased competition among major exchanges in the US and UK for international listings, particularly from Chinese firms. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, and the London Stock Exchange are also pursuing foreign listings to boost their revenues. As of the latest data, 18 Chinese companies are listed on the TSX, compared to 17 on the NYSE and 10 on Nasdaq. In addition to new listings, the TSX plans to expand revenue streams through data distribution and the development of new markets for structured products, such as exchange-traded funds and income trusts, which are similar to real-estate investment trusts in the US.

He praised the NYSE as the world's best exchange brand but suggested that traditional floor-based exchanges may not have a sustainable future. The NYSE is currently considering transitioning to a for-profit company while awaiting regulatory changes that would transform its market into a hybrid system combining floor-based and automated trading. The TSX Group and Canadian stock exchanges have implemented changes that some analysts believe are overdue in the US, where certain regional exchanges are experiencing difficulties in maintaining competitiveness. The TSX's growth strategy has been supported by a successful demutualization in 2000 and its subsequent listing as a public company in 2002. This followed the closure of the Toronto Stock Exchange's trading floor in the late 1990s, after the introduction of decimal trading in 1998. In 1999, the Canadian Venture Exchange was established by merging the Vancouver and Alberta stock exchanges, later joined by the equities segment of the Montreal exchange. The exchange, which serves as a marketplace for younger and developing companies, was acquired by the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2001, and rebranded as TSX Venture in 2002. Last year, the TSX Group generated CDN$295.6m in revenues, a 26 per cent increase, and achieved net profits of CDN$98.4m, up 29 per cent from 2003. The TSX attracted 204 new listings in the previous year, 115 of which were initial public offerings. The exchange currently lists 1,421 companies with a total market capitalization of CDN$1,546bn and an average daily trading volume of 251.1m shares."

        "original_text": "The eurozone's trade deficit with China soared to Euros 41.1bn (Dollars 48.1bn, Pounds 28.6bn) in the first 10 months of last year, reducing sharply the region's overall trade surplus. The figures from Eurostat, the European Union's statistical office, highlighted the pace of change in European trade patterns. Chinese products are penetrating higher value-added markets, such as electronics, but the sharp rise in imports also reflected the impact of EU investment in China, economists said. \"These trends are going to continue. You are seeing, for instance, the German corporate sector investing massively in China and there after re-importing goods into Europe,\" said Jacques Cailloux, economist at JP Morgan. The Euros 41.1bn deficit with China - by far the biggest with any of Europe's trading partners - is already larger than the entire 2003 deficit. In the first 10 months of 2003 the deficit with China was Euros 32bn. Imports from China into the 12-country eurozone in the 10 months to October were 23 per cent higher than the same period a year before, while exports to China were up 16 per cent. In comparison, the eurozone had a trade surplus with the UK of Euros 53.2bn in the same period and a surplus of Euros 50.3bn with the US. For the full EU, the trade deficit with China in the 10 months to October last year was Euros 62.7bn, up from Euros 51.8bn in the same period a year before. The UK, not a eurozone member, has been running one of the biggest deficits with China in recent years - followed by the Netherlands, Italy and France. Separately, Eurostat said that the eurozone's trade surplus with the rest of the world in November fell to a seasonally-adjusted Euros 2.8bn - the lowest level since July 2001. Economists said penetration of Chinese goods was a factor. In the eurozone, export growth remained robust in November, rising by 2.5 per cent compared with the previous month - raising hopes external demand would continue to support the region's modest economic recovery, despite the strength of the euro against the dollar. Germany last year confirmed its position as the world's top export nation. See International Economy page",
        "debiased_text": "The eurozone recorded a trade deficit with China of 41.1 billion euros (approximately 48.1 billion US dollars and 28.6 billion British pounds) during the first 10 months of last year. This deficit significantly reduced the region's overall trade surplus. According to data from Eurostat, the European Union's statistical office, this reflects a shift in European trade dynamics. Chinese imports have increased in higher value-added sectors, including electronics. The increase in imports was also attributed to EU investment in China, as noted by economists. Jacques Cailloux, an economist at JP Morgan, stated that these trends are expected to continue, citing examples such as German corporate investment in China followed by re-importation of goods into Europe. The 41.1 billion euro deficit with China is the largest among all of the eurozone's trading partners and exceeds the entire deficit recorded in the same period of 2003, which was 32 billion euros. Imports from China into the eurozone for the 10 months ending in October were 23 percent higher than the same period a year earlier, while exports to China increased by 16 percent. In the same period, the eurozone had a trade surplus of 53.2 billion euros with the UK and a surplus of 50.3 billion euros with the US. For the full EU, the trade deficit with China during the 10 months to October last year amounted to 62.7 billion euros, compared to 51.8 billion euros in the same period a year prior. The UK, which is not part of the eurozone, has been experiencing one of the largest trade deficits with China in recent years, followed by the Netherlands, Italy, and France. Additionally, Eurostat reported that the eurozone's trade surplus with the rest of the world in November dropped to a seasonally-adjusted 2.8 billion euros, marking the lowest level since July 2001. Economists indicated that the increasing presence of Chinese goods in the market contributed to this decline. In November, export growth in the eurozone remained strong, rising by 2.5 percent compared to the previous month, which raised expectations that external demand would continue to support the region's gradual economic recovery, despite the euro's strength against the dollar. Germany confirmed its position as the world's leading exporter in the previous year."

        "title": "Snooker: Davis holds his nerve",
        "original_text": "Steve Davis's 9-6 semi-final defeat of Stephen Hendry in the UK Championship at York last night was not the trouncing that appeared likely when he led 8-2, but it was still a memorable success and won him a place in the 100th final of his 27-year professional career. Victory over either Joe Perry or the 18-year-old China Open champion Ding Jun Hui, who meet in today's semi-final, would give Davis his 74th title and make him, at 48, the oldest UK champion. The result made a nonsense of head-to-head statistics, 41-16 in Hendry's favour, including their last nine meetings, but this week Davis has rediscovered the form that enabled him to dominate the 1980s with six world and six UK titles. A marginal but highly significant change in his sighting and alignment has underpinned what may look like a magical restoration of his powers. Davis's third Masters title eight years ago had seemed increasingly likely to stand as the last major success of his career, particularly as he could not quite get over the line from three up with four to play against Ronnie O'Sullivan in their 2004 Welsh Open final. For almost a decade Davis has appeared to be hanging on in a tier of players just below the regular title contenders. This week, though, he has proved himself anew as a master. His 9-8 defeat of the defending champion Stephen Maguire, which included a career-high break of 145 (excluding the game's first televised maximum in the Lada Classic 23 years ago), arose from what was essentially a potting and break-building contest. His 9-7 quarter-final defeat of Ken Doherty, set up with a virtually watertight tactical game that gave him a 6-1 lead, was to show him cool under the pressure of the Dubliner's recovery. It was no surprise that Davis kept it tight yesterday, as Hendry much prefers a fast flowing game. Assisted by winning the second frame on the black and the third on the pink, and with Hendry failing to exploit his admittedly infrequent chances, Davis led 5-0. \"Every time I played what I thought was a good safety shot, Steve played a better one,\" said Hendry. Mostly through his initial 52, Hendry won the sixth, but made no impact in the remaining two frames of the afternoon as contributions of 57 and 87 helped Davis to his commanding 7-1 interval lead \"Stephen has never played as badly against me as he did in the afternoon,\" said Davis. Judging by the number of pots he missed, Hendry was psychologically shattered. Davis confirmed his delight at being in tomorrow's final. \"It makes it even more special to have beaten Stephen because he's been my nemesis. I owe him one. I owe him about 30, actually.\"",
        "debiased_text": "Steve Davis defeated Stephen Hendry with a score of 9-6 in the semi-final of the UK Championship at York last night. The match was not as decisive as the initial score suggested, with Davis leading 8-2 at one point. This victory earned Davis a place in the 100th final of his 27-year professional career. If Davis wins against either Joe Perry or Ding Jun Hui, the 18-year-old China Open champion, in the upcoming semi-final, it would mark his 74th title and make him, at 48 years old, the oldest UK Championship champion in history. The result contradicted previous head-to-head statistics, which had shown a 41-16 advantage in Hendry's favor, including their last nine encounters. However, Davis has demonstrated a resurgence in form this week, reminiscent of his dominant years in the 1980s when he won six world titles and six UK titles. A slight but meaningful adjustment in his sighting and alignment appears to have contributed to his improved performance. Davis's third Masters title, achieved eight years ago, had seemed to be his final major success, especially after he fell short against Ronnie O'Sullivan in the 2004 Welsh Open final. For nearly a decade, Davis was often seen as a player just below the top contenders in terms of title competition. This week, however, Davis proved his capability once again as a top-level competitor. His 9-8 victory over the defending champion Stephen Maguire included a career-high score of 145, excluding the first televised maximum break in the Lada Classic 23 years earlier. The match was characterized by a contest focused on potting and building breaks. In the quarter-final, Davis defeated Ken Doherty with a score of 9-7, having established a 6-1 lead through a strong tactical performance, which demonstrated his composure under pressure as Doherty made a comeback. Davis maintained a tight game against Hendry, who prefers a fast-paced style of play. Davis took the second frame on the black and the third on the pink, and Hendry did not effectively capitalize on his limited opportunities, allowing Davis to build a lead of 5-0. Hendry commented on Davis's skill, stating, 'Every time I played what I thought was a good safety shot, Steve played a better one.' During the first half of the match, Hendry managed to win the sixth frame, but had no further success in the afternoon sessions. Davis's scores of 57 and 87 in the afternoon contributed to his lead of 7-1. Davis noted Hendry's performance, saying, 'Stephen has never played as badly against me as he did in the afternoon,' and remarked that Hendry missed numerous shots. Davis confirmed his satisfaction with reaching the final and mentioned, 'It makes it even more special to have beaten Stephen because he's been my nemesis. I owe him one.

        "title": "Carlyle Group to Acquire 85% Of Chinese Construction Firm; Carlyle Group to Acquire 85% Of Chinese Construction Firm",
        "original_text": "Carlyle Group agreed to acquire 85% of a Chinese construction- equipment manufacturer in a $375 million pact that may usher in an era of bigger deals by foreign private-equity funds. The buyout of state-owned Xugong Group Construction Machinery Co. took more than two years to complete, as Carlyle and local Chinese government officials wrangled over potential deal sinkers, including cost cutting and staff reductions. For private-equity firms angling to get into China, this transaction offers a lesson in delays that can occur and encouragement that China may be warming to buyouts of some state-owned enterprises. Last month Carlyle agreed to invest $400 million for 24.9% of China Pacific Life Insurance Co. A dispute with China Pacific Life's state-owned parent had delayed the deal's signing for more than a year. Also in recent months, Warburg Pincus of the U.S. and Hong Kong's Citic Capital Markets Holding Ltd. have taken control of another state entity, Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holding Co. Until now, most deals have involved minority stakes in privately run Chinese companies. In the Xugong deal, Carlyle will pay $375 million to parent company Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, which will keep a 15% stake. People close to the deal said a handful of second-tier foreign banks agreed to extend a loan as part of the financing. Carlyle will guarantee the loan, these people said, declining to identify the banks involved. The deal requires a final nod from China's central government. Still, the deal's structure is a far cry from the kind of leveraged buyout known in the U.S. and Europe. In Western-style LBOs, private- equity shops put up around one-third of the total purchase price, financing the rest with debt on the target company's balance sheet. Xugong's parent had owned 51% of the company. In August, Citigroup Inc. provided credit to the parent so Xuzhou could buy back Xugong's shares from other state entities and resell them to Carlyle. People familiar with Citigroup's loan say it was less than $50 million. Located in Jiangsu province, north of Shanghai, Xugong is one of China's biggest construction companies. Amid the two-year-long talks, Xugong named several foreign suitors it said had come courting, including construction-equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. and private- equity fund J.P. Morgan Partners. Xugong's business is almost entirely domestic, and one of Carlyle's main tasks is building exports, especially to the Middle East and Southeast Asia, said Yang Xiang-Dong, co-head of buyouts in Asia at Carlyle. In evaluating Xugong, Carlyle brought in executives from U.S.-based Grand Vehicle Works, a maker of transportation products, another Carlyle-owned firm. Grand Vehicle executives helped the fund determine what it would take to expand Xugong's business overseas and make the company an attractive joint venture partner, Mr. Yang said. Carlyle doesn't plan significant layoffs at the company, he added. --- Carlyle in China A look at Carlyle Asia's investing activities in China DATE TARGET (value in millions of dollars) STAKE OCT. 2005 Xugong Group Construction Machinery ($375) 85% SEPT. 2005 China Pacific Life Insurance ($400) 24.9% JUNE 2001 Pacific China Holdings ($135) 40%",
        "debiased_text": "Carlyle Group has reached an agreement to acquire 85% of Xugong Group Construction Machinery Co., a Chinese construction-equipment manufacturer, in a $375 million transaction. The acquisition process took more than two years to finalize, as discussions between Carlyle and local Chinese government officials addressed various aspects of the deal. This transaction may serve as an example for other private-equity firms interested in entering the Chinese market, highlighting both the potential challenges and opportunities associated with acquiring state-owned enterprises. In a separate investment, Carlyle agreed last month to invest $400 million for a 24.9% stake in China Pacific Life Insurance Co. The signing of that deal was delayed for over a year due to a dispute with the state-owned parent company of China Pacific Life. Recently, Warburg Pincus and Citic Capital Markets Holding Ltd. have also taken control of another state-owned entity, Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holding Co. Previously, most deals in China involved minority stakes in privately run companies. In the Xugong deal, Carlyle will pay $375 million to the parent company, Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, which will retain a 15% ownership stake. Individuals associated with the deal mentioned that several second-tier foreign banks agreed to provide a loan as part of the financing, with Carlyle assuming responsibility for guaranteeing the loan. The banks involved have not been named. The deal still needs approval from China's central government. The structure of the deal differs significantly from the leveraged buyouts commonly used in the U.S. and Europe. In Western-style leveraged buyouts, private-equity firms typically cover about one-third of the purchase price and finance the remainder using debt on the target company's balance sheet. Xugong's parent company previously held a 51% stake in the company. In August, Citigroup Inc. provided credit to the parent company so that Xuzhou could repurchase Xugong's shares from other state entities and resell them to Carlyle. Those familiar with the loan said the amount was less than $50 million. Based in Jiangsu province, north of Shanghai, Xugong is a large construction company within China. During the two-year negotiation period, Xugong reportedly received interest from several foreign companies, including Caterpillar Inc. and J.P. Morgan Partners. According to Yang Xiang-Dong, co-head of buyouts in Asia at Carlyle, one of the company's primary goals is to expand Xugong's international business, particularly in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. In its evaluation of Xugong, Carlyle involved executives from Grand Vehicle Works, a U.S.-based transportation products manufacturer that is also owned by Carlyle. These executives assisted Carlyle in determining the necessary steps for expanding Xugong's overseas operations and making the company a more attractive joint venture partner. Carlyle has stated that it does not plan for significant staff reductions at the company."

It was the first time the governor had spoken about the three- month-old incident, which has been widely reported by the international media. Mr Huang also admitted that Guangdong was facing a problem with social unrest which was caused mainly by land requisition disputes and public anger at \"a few corrupt grass-roots cadres\".

There are many conflicting interests and voices. Social strife and a high crime rate are common phenomena at this stage of development, not just for us but also for other countries,\" he said. Guangdong has seen a number of high-profile social protests in the past year - including a crackdown on activists and villagers in Taishi, and police firing on villagers in Shanwei. In his Government Work Report, delivered on Sunday, Premier Wen Jiabao also noted that unlawful land requisitions had caused public resentment. Mr Huang said Guangdong party secretary Zhang Dejiang had repeatedly asked officials to comply with land requisition procedures and most requisitions had been carried out in accordance with the law.

        "original_text": "Beijing -- CHINA'S IMPOSITION of further controls on foreign financial media represents the latest stage in Beijing's long-term strategy to transform its national news agency from a lumbering propaganda organ into a globally competitive media giant. New rules issued Sunday cast a spotlight on Xinhua, a news organization that has long been the mouthpiece of China's leadership but that is also struggling with its changing role as China's economy opens and its people have access to new forms of information. The move amounts to a Xinhua land grab in the nation's quickly expanding market for financial news and information, making clear that it wants to limit the expansion of economic-news vendors such as Reuters Group PLC, Bloomberg LP and Dow Jones & Co. -- and eventually take over their business. Xinhua, a behemoth of 13,000 employees with reporters around the world, also reasserted its traditional control over what information the Chinese general public can read, imposing new restrictions on foreign-news content entering China. Foreign general newswires, as distinct from economic-news vendors, have never been allowed to sell directly to domestic publications and must already go through Xinhua. In an interview, an official of the Xinhua subsidiary that foreign economic-news vendors would be required to use as their sales agent in China said fees will be part of negotiations with the vendors. The annual revenue of all foreign-information suppliers in China is estimated at $100 million. More broadly, the rules, according to media analysts and insiders, fit in with the Communist government's plans to use Xinhua -- once known as the Red China News Agency -- to shore up its domestic political control and further its international ambitions. President Hu Jintao has been using Xinhua to reassert political order over a once-monolithic domestic news media fragmented by the explosive growth of the Internet. In addition, Xinhua and its state- owned siblings are being groomed for another mission: to spread China's ideas and values around the globe. The rules are drawing international attention and criticism as China is preparing for a prominent appearance on the global stage: the Beijing Olympics in 2008.",
        "debiased_text": "Beijing -- China has implemented additional regulations on foreign financial media, marking a development in its ongoing efforts to reposition its national news agency, Xinhua, as a globally competitive media entity. New guidelines introduced on Sunday have drawn attention to Xinhua, which has historically served as the voice of China's leadership but is currently adapting to China's evolving economic landscape and increased public access to diverse information sources. The regulations are seen as an effort to establish greater influence over the growing market for financial news and information within the country, aiming to restrict the operations of foreign economic news providers such as Reuters Group PLC, Bloomberg LP, and Dow Jones & Co. Xinhua, which employs approximately 13,000 people and has a global presence, has also reinforced its control over the information available to the general public in China, imposing new restrictions on foreign news content. Unlike economic news vendors, foreign general news agencies have not been permitted to sell directly to domestic publications and must currently route their content through Xinhua. An official from a Xinhua subsidiary, which will act as a sales agent for foreign economic news vendors in China, mentioned that fees will be part of future negotiations with these vendors. The estimated annual revenue of all foreign information suppliers in China is approximately $100 million.

        "original_text": "China is turning to vocational training as a means of prolonging its economic ascendancy and quelling unrest. It's an urgent priority, given that recent college graduates can't find jobs and the lack of educational opportunities in the countryside is stoking rural unrest. Last month the All-China Federation of Trade Unions announced a \"small business-credit plan for nationwide workers,\" which will provide $125 million in loans to help some 250,000 laid-off workers get additional vocational training in order to find new jobs. Similarly, the Shanghai Committee of the Communist Party of China endorsed a development blueprint to create a \"new socialist countryside,\" including higher subsidies to farmers for training in modern agricultural methods. The appeal of vocational schools is growing partly in response to the growing realization that a Chinese university degree can be a ticket to nowhere. When China's schools reopened after the Cultural Revolution, there weren't enough universities to accommodate a generation of disenfranchised scholars. Now the opposite is true. In the last seven years the number of Chinese college graduates has quintupled, reaching 4.1 million this year. But the National Development and Reform Commission reports that at least 60 percent of these graduates can't find work. In contrast, vocational schools are popular because students learn real skills, from plumbing to nursing, that can be applied outside the classroom. When Li Xiangdong graduated from high school last year, he defied his parents' wish that he find a job, and enrolled in a vocational school near his home in southwestern Beijing offering classes in Leisure Sports Service and Management in anticipation of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics. \"Now I know I will have the training to find a better job when I graduate,\" he says. \"I will be able to assist my family and improve my future.\" And while urban universities draw the best and the brightest from the countryside--worsening a vast urban-rural divide--most of China's more than 17,000 vocational schools are located in small villages. \"Vocational training can help improve the standard of living of an entire community,\" says Peng Peigen, an architecture professor at Qinghua University. Peng's China First Joint Venture Architecture Firm endowed a vocational school in China's southern Yunnan province last year to train what he calls \"barefoot architects\" to take energy-efficient building methods to farm regions.

A July 14 meeting will be held in Beijing for investors to vote, China Asset Management said in a statement published in the Shanghai Securities News. The conversion will also require approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. China Asset Management said it was pursuing the change to shield investors from price fluctuations as the fund's Nov. 14 maturity nears. It is the first fund to plan such a vote. A closed-end fund has a fixed number of shares, usually listed on a stock exchange. Unlike open-end funds, they don't stand ready to redeem and issue shares continuously. Investors in an open-end fund have an equity position in the fund that they can sell back to the managers, an appealing proposition if the fund's share price trades at a discount to the net value of the fund's underlying assets.",

        "title": "Tesco spends £180m to take control of Chinese joint venture",
        "original_text": "Tesco yesterday increased its stake to 90% in a Chinese joint venture, Ting Hsin, that owns the Hymall chain of 44 stores. The deal, valued at £180m, marks a bolder phase in the group's expansion into China. Until now the British firm has kept a relatively low profile in the world's most populous nation. When Tesco bought its first stake in 2004, Ting Hsin had only 25 stores, and almost all of them were in the stretch of the Yangtze delta near Shanghai. Since then, new supermarkets have opened at the rate of almost one a month. In the new year, the company will start trading from its first store in Beijing, its 44th nationwide outlet. The large Beijing store, the first to carry the Tesco name, will open next year employing 500 staff. Tesco said raising its stake in Hymall from 50% will allow the company to accelerate its growth in China. Sir Terry Leahy, Tesco's chief executive, said: \"We have seen exciting growth in China since announcing the joint venture two years ago and are looking forward to the partnership entering a new phase. Ting Hsin continues to be a large shareholder in the business. They are a valued supplier of food products and we benefit from their unrivalled local knowledge as we grow the Hymall business together.\" Tesco's growth of about 12% a year is pedestrian by Chinese standards, where the market contains more than 1 billion shoppers. This year WalMart - which has 66 stores - announced plans to create 150,000 jobs in China by 2010. Carrefour still leads the field with 76 hypermarkets, and more than 100 discount shops. Even this pales by comparison with the dominant domestic player, Hualian, with 2,000 outlets. While foreign rivals are pushing inland into the second-tier cities where the retail markets are relatively undeveloped, Tesco has taken a more conservative approach. It has focused on the four main urban centres - Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou and Beijing - where incomes are far higher than the national average but competition is tougher. Tesco has a long way to catch up in terms of establishing brand awareness. While Carrefour and WalMart have been marketing for several years under their own names, Tesco sat coyly behind Hymall and its Happy Shopper logo. This policy changed in September, when the firm announced that it would introduce 500 products, including noodles, soap and napkins, under its own brand. Few British visitors would recognise Tesco in China and the merchandise could not be more different. In the tradition of Asian wet markets, the frogs, turtles, fish and silkworm grubs are so fresh that they jump, crawl, swim and wiggle around in the displays.",

The transaction is valued at £180 million and represents a more aggressive step in Tesco's expansion strategy in China. Previously, Tesco had maintained a lower profile in the country. When it first acquired a stake in 2004, Ting Hsin operated only 25 stores, primarily located in the Yangtze delta region near Shanghai. Since that time, the company has opened new supermarkets at a rate of nearly one per month. In the coming year, Tesco will open its first store in Beijing, marking its 44th store nationwide. The new Beijing store, which will be the first to feature the Tesco brand, is expected to employ 500 staff. Tesco stated that increasing its stake in Hymall from 50% will enable the company to enhance its growth in the Chinese market. Sir Terry Leahy, Tesco's chief executive, noted that the company has observed significant growth in China since the joint venture was announced two years ago and expressed anticipation for the partnership's next phase. He emphasized that Ting Hsin remains a major shareholder and is a valued supplier of food products, providing the company with essential local market expertise. Tesco's growth rate of approximately 12% annually is considered modest compared to the rapid development seen in the Chinese retail sector, which serves over 1 billion shoppers. This year, WalMart, which currently has 66 stores in China, announced plans to create 150,000 jobs in the country by 2010. Carrefour leads with 76 hypermarkets and over 100 discount shops. However, both WalMart and Carrefour have fewer outlets compared to Hualian, the leading domestic player, which operates 2,000 stores. While some foreign competitors are expanding into second-tier cities with less developed retail markets, Tesco has focused its efforts on the four major urban centers: Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Beijing. In these areas, average incomes are higher than the national average, but competition is also more intense. Tesco still faces challenges in establishing brand recognition within China. While Carrefour and WalMart have marketed their own brands for several years, Tesco has previously operated under the Hymall name and its Happy Shopper logo. This approach changed in September, with the company announcing plans to introduce 500 products, including items such as noodles, soap, and napkins, under its own brand. The merchandise and store environments in China differ significantly from those in the United Kingdom. In line with traditional Asian wet markets, the Hymall stores feature fresh produce such as frogs, turtles, fish, and silkworm grubs, which are displayed in a manner that showcases their liveliness."

        "original_text": "From Mr Daniel J. Aronoff. Sir, Martin Wolf's thoughtful essay on China's political situation focuses on the shifting balance of power between the emperor and the bureaucracy that runs through Chinese history and its implication for contemporary political prospects (\"An autocracy of bureaucrats can only crush China's growth\", May 31). I wish to suggest another perennial source of tension that will crucially affect China's future. The China scholar John King Fairbank wrote of the evergreen struggle between the imperial court, which controlled the centre, and the provinces. A weakened emperor not only lost control to rent- seeking bureaucrats, but also lost control of his hinterland and the revenues and perquisites that flowed from it. Periods of decentralisation have been feared above almost all else in Chinese society as a breeding ground for chaos or destructive warlordism. A fundamental value of Confucian philosophy is the preservation of order, from the household to the state. If Mr Wolf means to suggest that China would be better off with a strong, autocratic leader than a weak one, I think he is mistaken. There are clearly trade-offs. In the brief period of the Chinese republic of the early twentieth century, weak central control resulted in chaos and profiteering, but it also created the space for a flourishing of culture, political expression and economic growth beyond anything attained in all prior Chinese history. Today, the relative autonomy of the provinces has led to unchecked pressure on banks to lend to crony corporations controlled by provincial chieftains, an under-appreciated dimension of China's banking problems, but it has also engendered inter-regional competition for foreign investment that has increased economic growth. Chinese people have feared decentralisation in part, as Mr Wolf points out, because Chinese society has lacked the underpinnings of western civil society that allow for a \"spontaneous order\" to emerge leading to prosperity and freedom without descending into chaos, corruption or warlordism. The hope of China's future lies in the spread and belief in such civil values among the emerging educated middle class and the likelihood of people with these values ascending to power. Daniel J. Aronoff, Bloomfield Hills, MI 48304, US",

Sir, Martin Wolf's essay on China's political situation discusses the historical dynamic between the emperor and the bureaucratic system, and its implications for current political developments. I wish to highlight another long-standing tension that may significantly influence China's future. John King Fairbank, a China scholar, noted the recurring conflict between the imperial court, which governed the central authority, and the provinces. A weakened emperor not only faced increased influence from rent-seeking bureaucrats but also lost control over the provinces and the associated revenues and benefits. In Chinese society, periods of decentralization have often been regarded as a potential source of instability or warlordism. Confucian philosophy emphasizes the maintenance of order, ranging from the household to the state level. If Mr. Wolf implies that a strong, autocratic leader is preferable to a weak one, I believe this may be an oversimplification. There are trade-offs involved. During the early twentieth century, when China was a republic with weaker central authority, it experienced chaos and corruption but also saw cultural, political, and economic advancements not previously observed in Chinese history. Today, the relative autonomy of the provinces has contributed to banking challenges, as provincial leaders have exerted pressure on banks to provide loans to crony corporations under their control. However, it has also fostered inter-regional competition for foreign investment, which has spurred economic growth. The fear of decentralization in China, as Mr. Wolf notes, is partly due to the absence of certain foundational elements of Western civil society that enable spontaneous order, leading to prosperity and freedom without descending into chaos, corruption, or warlordism. The future prospects for China may depend on the increasing presence and influence of civil values among the emerging educated middle class and the possibility of individuals adhering to these values attaining positions of power."

From the Royaum sedan to the Excelle hatchback, it's fleet is known for style, precision design and superior quality in China. There, GM is the hot No. 1 carmaker, and Toyota struggles in fifth place. This is a mirror image of the auto market in America, where the plants that best resemble Buick's Shanghai operation are run by foreign labels like Toyota, Honda, Hyundai and BMW in the sun belt, not Michigan. These transplants are the reason that the U.S. automotive sector employs more people today than it did in 1990 and delivers 55 percent more output, despite the decline of Detroit. Taken together, however, the stories of GM in Shanghai, and Toyota in America, offer a simple lesson: the problem with U.S. carmaking is not management or work force, but the way they mix in the century-old bureaucracies of Detroit. By measure--labor efficiency--the Big Three are closing the gap with foreign rivals, according to the 2006 Harbour Report, a survey of industry competitiveness. The average number of worker hours GM takes to make a car is now 33.2, within minutes of Honda and just 7.3 hours behind industry pacesetter Nissan. In 1998, that gap stood at 16.6 hours and represented more than $1,000 in additional costs per vehicle for U.S. makers.

The brand's models, such as the Royaum sedan and the Excelle hatchback, are noted for style and precision. In China, General Motors holds the top position in the automotive market, while Toyota ranks fifth. This contrasts with the U.S. auto market, where foreign car manufacturers like Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, and BMW operate in regions such as the Sun Belt, rather than Michigan. These foreign operations have contributed to increased employment and production levels in the U.S. automotive sector compared to 1990, despite the decline of Detroit. The performance of GM in Shanghai and Toyota in America suggests that challenges in U.S. car manufacturing may be attributed to the traditional, long-established management structures in Detroit.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission published a draft of rules it said it will adopt to reflect the regulatory environment in Hong Kong and other markets. A key element in the draft, published on the commission's Web site late Monday, is to permit stock issuers to set a single price for institutional and \"retail,\" or individual, investors. Institutional investors would be consulted to set a price range for the stock, and retail investors would make refundable applications to pay the top price. The effect of the rules would be to help make it possible for companies to sell stock simultaneously on mainland China's stock markets and exchanges elsewhere, specifically Hong Kong. A number of pricing and accounting changes are needed before ICBC, China's largest bank by assets, can go ahead with an IPO that could raise as much as $19 billion in Hong Kong and Shanghai -- which would make it the world's biggest and the first to launch simultaneously in those two markets. \"This arrangement is the same as share-offering procedures in Hong Kong . . . and it is very important for companies seeking dual listing of A- and H-shares to set IPO prices at the same time and get listed at the same time,\" a CSRC official said in a statement published yesterday in the official China Securities Journal, which also carried text of the proposed rules. Class-A shares are denominated in yuan and traded by domestic investors and selected foreign institutional investors. Class H shares are Hong Kong-listed shares issued by companies registered and based in China. The simplified IPO-pricing process would shorten the share-offering period, improve efficiency and make offerings more market-oriented, analysts said. They also said IPO prices could now be higher, however, as a result of the early-stage participation of IPO-hungry retail investors who are expected to get half of big offerings, compared with just 10% in developed markets elsewhere. \"The rules are removing the technical obstacles for the simultaneous listing of ICBC and other large-sized Chinese companies in the future,\" said Zhou Lin, an analyst at Huatai Securities. Documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires show ICBC could sell shares before the end of October.

Mr Wen's comments, ahead of a meeting with Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, reflected Beijing's careful public diplomacy aimed at drawing North Korea back to the negotiating table after its nuclear test two weeks ago. \"China would like to work more closely with relevant parties to break the stalemate and resume the stalled six-party talks,\" said Li Zhaoxing, China's foreign minister, before his meeting with Ms Rice. The US has said a resumption of the six-party talks, which also involve Russia, Japan and South Korea, would not be sufficient to justify ending sanctions imposed by the UN on Pyongyang last week. China has put further restrictions on financial transactions with its neighbour in the wake of the test, and has been debating more stringent sanctions on top of the UN restrictions. Beijing supplies about 70 to 80 per cent of North Korea's oil, at what are believed to be discounted prices. It was reported to have briefly interrupted oil supplies to North Korea in 2003 during a breakdown in talks on the nuclear programme, but international relations experts in Beijing said they doubted such action was taken. Ms Rice travelled to Beijing after meetings in Tokyo and Seoul in a bid to retain a united front between the five nations negotiating with Pyongyang and to ensure the UN sanctions were carried through. \"We talked about the importance of the full implementation of (UN resolution) 1718 so we can make certain there is not a transit and trade in illegal materials, dangerous illegal materials, concerning the nuclear programme of (North Korea),\" she said. Beijing has long had a tense, frustrating relationship with its fraternal neighbour and has been angered by Pyongyang's behaviour in recent months. But it puts some of the blame for Pyongyang's actions on the US and its refusal to conduct bilateral talks with North Korea, and its unilateral imposition of financial sanctions last year. Mr Li said he hoped \"all the involved parties will be cool- headed and responsible and adhere to dialogue and negotiation as the general direction of our efforts\". He said China would \"strive to break the stalemate as soon as possible and restart the six-party talks.\" Hu Jintao, China's president, dispatched a diplomatic delegation to Pyongyang this week headed by a special envoy, Tang Jiaxuan, a former foreign minister, after reports that North Korea was planning a second test. Mr Tang told Ms Rice that his visit, during which he met Kim Jong- il, the North Korean leader, \"had not been in vain\", but gave no details. Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, citing diplomatic sources in Beijing, said last night that Mr Kim had told Mr Tang he did not plan any further tests.",

China has implemented additional restrictions on financial transactions with North Korea since the nuclear test and is considering further sanctions in addition to the UN measures. Beijing is reported to supply approximately 70 to 80 percent of North Korea's oil at discounted prices.

        "original_text": "Three hundred million people from rural China - that's five times the UK population - will move to its cities in the next 20 years. Existing cities will expand and grow at an almost unimaginable pace - and more than 300 new ones are to be built. One of them is Dongtan, on Chongming Island at the mouth of the Yangtze river, close to Shanghai. I visited it in July. It is to be an eco city, an environmental experiment on a huge scale. It will have a number of satellite towns in an area the size of several English counties, providing homes for hundreds of thousands of people - all living and working sustainably on an island that is designated as an internationally important wetland under the Ramsar treaty. I wanted to see the work going into the design of a city in which the ultimate aim is to be carbon neutral. The first phase includes capturing and purifying water, waste management recycling, reducing landfill and, most importantly, creating combined heat and power systems linked to renewables that will provide the technology to source clean and reliable energy. The UK can be particularly proud that its environmental expertise is helping to make this possible. The University of East Anglia has led the development of the Yangtze Star, a renewable, low-carbon power station that will power Dongtan. Smart design is wonderful, but we wanted to find out if a city can be truly self-sustaining in the long term. In Dongtan, a sustainability framework sets out the objectives and requirements for the whole development, which make the environment the city's first focus. Those requirements will be written into every development and construction contract for the project. China hopes that the new technology and the innovative way of urban living being pioneered at Dongtan will be replicated throughout China and beyond. The challenges in the UK are different. We don't have available to us the vast swaths of empty land that China has, and people in Britain have much greater influence over how their money is spent. Most significantly, our approach to planning authorisation and public consultation is radically different - giving greater autonomy and voice to regional and local governments, to interest groups and to residents. But Britain can learn from the Chinese. We must have their level of aspiration here in the UK. Our children are like the inheritors of Midas - given a world in which all true beauty and everything natural has been despoiled in a relentless pursuit of wealth. But people, just as much as governments, can and do aspire to leave the world a better place. We are willing to do what is difficult, what is almost beyond the limits of our imaginations. No matter where we live, such action is absolutely fundamental to the survival of humans on this planet. Part of that lies in making small but significant changes in our daily lives - changes that many of us are already starting to make. But alongside those small changes must stand ambitious, imaginative and daring projects like Dongtan. · Barry Gardiner is minister for biodiversity. · Email your comments to society@theguardian.com.

        "debiased_text": "Three hundred million people from rural China are expected to move to cities within the next 20 years, which is five times the population of the United Kingdom. This urbanization will lead to the expansion of existing cities and the construction of more than 300 new cities. One of these new cities is Dongtan, located on Chongming Island at the mouth of the Yangtze River near Shanghai. A visit to the site in July revealed that the city is designed as an eco-city, intended to be a large-scale environmental experiment. The development will include satellite towns over an area comparable to several English counties, designed to accommodate hundreds of thousands of residents living and working in a sustainable manner on a site designated as an internationally important wetland under the Ramsar treaty. The primary goal of the project is to achieve carbon neutrality. The first phase focuses on water capture and purification, waste management and recycling, reduction of landfill, and the implementation of combined heat and power systems linked to renewable energy sources. This initiative aims to provide clean and reliable energy for the city's needs. The University of East Anglia is leading the development of the Yangtze Star, a renewable and low-carbon power station that will supply energy to Dongtan. The city’s design includes a sustainability framework that sets environmental objectives and requirements for all development and construction contracts. China aims to replicate the new technologies and innovative urban living approaches pioneered in Dongtan across the country and potentially beyond. The challenges in the United Kingdom differ, as there is less available land for such large-scale projects compared to China, and British citizens have greater influence over the usage of public funds. The UK’s planning authorization and public consultation processes are structured differently, granting more autonomy and input to regional and local governments, interest groups, and residents. However, the UK can benefit from China's aspirations and efforts. There is a need for similar levels of ambition in the UK to address the environmental impact of economic development. Individuals, in addition to governments, can and do aim to improve the world for future generations. Taking on difficult and imaginative projects, alongside making small, significant changes in daily life, is essential for the long-term sustainability of human existence on the planet."

        "original_text": "The first state visit to America by Hu Jintao, Chinese president, next month presents an important opportunity for both countries to establish a more productive path to further mutual interests. With the US as China's second largest trading partner and China as America's third largest our countries are economically intertwined in such a way that we are increasingly dependent on each other's success. Yet notwithstanding the incentives we have to work together, the relationship between the US and China is in need of improvement. Throughout the 1990s, the US business community was a forceful advocate for China, especially in supporting its accession in 2001 to the World Trade Organisation - an important milestone in China's rise. But as US businesses continue to encounter restrictions on their access to China's markets and as China's enforcement of intellectual property rights remains weak, the US business community faces challenges in continuing to be an advocate for China. In response to growing US trade deficits, the senators Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham have introduced a bill to impose an across-the-board tariff on Chinese imports in an effort to influence China's exchange rate policy. Opponents of the bill believe the renminbi exchange rate should be driven by market dynamics and international monetary co-operation, not by punitive US legislation. But whether one agrees or disagrees with this proposed law, it offers an early warning to Chinese leaders that the US business community is in jeopardy of losing political support for policies that would promote China's economic growth through open trade and investment liberalisation. In February Rob Portman, US trade representative, issued a review of US-China trade policy, emphasising that \"China must play its part in addressing the global imbalances that have arisen during the past four years of rapid global growth\". Mr Portman expressed \"concern that the US-China trade relationship lacks balance in opportunity, as well as equity and durability\". The time has come to strengthen the constructive relationship between the US and China. China can start by demonstrating its willingness to remove barriers and open markets, enforce protection of intellectual property rights, strengthen its currency and signal its readiness to level the playing field by, for example, joining the WTO agreement on government procurement. China also has a responsibility to play a leadership role in the successful completion of the Doha multilateral trade negotiations, which could help hundreds of millions of people who now try to survive on less than Dollars 2 a day. The business community needs to help the American public understand the importance of our relationship with China. We need to rebut calls for counterproductive, protectionist measures and support a co-ordinated, comprehensive China policy that addresses key issues and provides for effective communication to the public. That policy should include making the Group of Eight nations the Group of Nine with the addition of China. Our China policy must be set in the context of a policy for Asia. The need to strengthen relationships and deepen understanding between Asia and the US has never been more vital. Priorities include negotiating and implementing free trade agreements with South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia, and Vietnam's accession to the WTO. We in the US must also address impediments to American competitiveness, understanding that this issue will not be solved through protectionist legislation. We need, for example, to strengthen our educational infrastructure to boost student performance and close achievement gaps; increase competencies in subjects such as maths, science and engineering; ensure that our students acquire the skills - including language skills - necessary to succeed in international and intercultural environments; and embed continuous learning in our culture. This is a big agenda and now is the time for the US and China to move forward. We must make headway on areas of mutual interest, continue a constructive dialogue aimed at removing impasses and improve the relationship. Some critics see China's economic rise as a zero-sum game, where China's gain is our loss. China needs to work with us to prove the critics wrong.

        "debiased_text": "The upcoming state visit to America by Hu Jintao, Chinese president, offers an opportunity for both countries to explore ways to enhance their mutual interests. The United States is China's second largest trading partner, and China is the United States' third largest, indicating a significant level of economic interdependence. However, the relationship between the two nations is experiencing challenges and requires further development. During the 1990s, the U.S. business community expressed strong support for China, notably in facilitating its accession to the World Trade Organisation in 2001. Currently, U.S. businesses face difficulties related to market access restrictions and China's enforcement of intellectual property rights. In response to increasing trade deficits, senators Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham proposed a bill to impose tariffs on Chinese imports to influence China's exchange rate policy. Views on the bill differ, with some arguing that the renminbi exchange rate should be determined by market forces and international cooperation. This proposal serves as a reminder to Chinese leaders that the U.S. business community may be at risk of losing political backing for policies aimed at promoting China's economic growth through open trade and investment. In February, Rob Portman, the U.S. trade representative, released a report evaluating U.S.-China trade policy, stating that 'China must play its part in addressing the global imbalances that have arisen during the past four years of rapid global growth'. He expressed concerns regarding the lack of balance, opportunity, equity, and durability in the U.S.-China trade relationship. It is now essential to reinforce the constructive relationship between the U.S. and China. China could begin by showing commitment to removing trade barriers, opening markets, enforcing intellectual property protection, strengthening its currency, and joining the WTO agreement on government procurement. Additionally, China has a role to play in supporting the completion of the Doha multilateral trade negotiations, which could benefit millions of people living on less than $2 a day. The business community has a responsibility to assist the American public in understanding the significance of the relationship with China. It is necessary to counter calls for protectionist measures that could be detrimental and promote a coordinated and comprehensive China policy that tackles key issues and communicates effectively with the public. This policy should consider the broader context of U.S. strategy in Asia. Strengthening ties and fostering understanding between the U.S. and Asia is increasingly important. Current priorities include negotiating and executing free trade agreements with South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and supporting Vietnam's accession to the WTO. The U.S. must also resolve issues affecting its competitiveness, recognizing that this cannot be achieved through protectionist legislation alone. Initiatives should include improving the educational infrastructure to enhance student performance, narrowing achievement gaps, and increasing competencies in subjects such as mathematics, science, and engineering. It is also important to ensure students possess the necessary skills, including language abilities, to thrive in international and intercultural settings. This is a significant agenda, and now is the time for the U.S. and China to progress. Both nations must advance mutual interests, maintain constructive dialogue to resolve deadlocks, and improve overall diplomatic relations. Some critics perceive China's economic rise as a zero-sum scenario, where China's growth comes at the expense of the U.S. China has an opportunity to work with the U.S. to address these concerns."

        "original_text": "Inside a gloomy tower block on the northwestern outskirts of Moscow a team of young computer programmers is deep in concentration. In a former life it was a nuclear research facility at the heart of the cold war. Now this dark skyscraper is home to a different kind of power struggle. Each day a dozen team members at the anti-virus firm Kaspersky Lab - mostly in their late teens or early 20s and nicknamed \"woodpeckers\" - work in 12 hour shifts to crack, decode and eradicate some of the world's most malicious computer viruses, or \"crimeware\". They examine and create antidotes to more than 200 pieces of code every day, but it is a task that is proving increasingly difficult. Over the weekend thousands of computers worldwide were crippled by the latest virus, Kama Sutra. The worm, which spread through emails and inside computer networks over the past month, was estimated to have caused tens of thousands of pounds damage as it attempted to erase files on infected computers. Last week the Russian stock exchange, a short distance from Kaspersky Lab, shut down for an hour after a virus attack. The danger of crimeware and hackers is being recognised by authorities and law enforcement around the globe. Last week Britain unveiled plans to stiffen its computer crime laws, doubling the maximum jail sentence for hacking to 10 years and making it illegal to own \"hacking tools\" such as password cracking software. And with good reason, say experts. \"Hackers don't want to damage computers any more, they want to own them,\" said Eugene Kaspersky, the founder of Kaspersky Lab. \"They've started to run direct attacks where just one business, or even just one computer, is infected.\" Mr Kaspersky knows the mind of a cyber-criminal better than most. For 15 years he has worked on understanding viruses and their creators. His company is one of a host of anti-virus and internet security companies fighting to keep their customers secure. It is a battle that is getting bigger. According to figures released by the FBI last week, around 90% of people have experienced computer security problems recently. Research published last year suggested that the global cybercrime industry is now worth more than the international illegal drugs trade. Through viruses and worms, hackers can control thousands of computers - turning them into \"zombies\". After that, they can steal people's identities, engage them in complex fraud or blackmail, send spam, attack websites, or run cyber-protection rackets. The internet security firm Sophos estimates that an unprotected computer connected to the internet has a 50% chance of being infected within 12 minutes. It is all a far cry from the earliest days of hacking, when viruses were created by bored teenagers. It is 20 years since the first widespread PC virus, Brain, which was created by brothers Amjad and Basit Farooq Alvi. Brain was a piece of trickery that began as a benign experiment but left corporate America shaking. Although there had been viruses before, business simply didn't understand the concept of security. As a result, Brain caused panic. \"What we saw 20 years ago was really technical enthusiasts, and people creating proof of concept viruses,\" said Sal Viveros, a security specialist with the anti-virus company McAfee. \"For the first seven or eight years that was really who made these things.\" But the days of playing for fun are long gone. According to research, just 5% of malicious programs are now written by bored teenagers. The rest are produced by ever increasing numbers of professional criminals and fraudsters. \"A lot of people are stuck in the 1990s, with their image of a virus writer as a kid eating pizza in their bedroom,\" said Graham Cluley, an expert with Sophos. \"In fact they are now much more serious, and much nastier.\" Mr Viveros agrees. \"Now that there's money involved, the threats have become a lot greater. The widespread adoption of broadband internet means that hackers have targets they can always access.\" Russia is often blamed for such activities, and a huge influx of computer science graduates and a large criminal fraternity have certainly combined to create a thriving underground. But China and Brazil are also notorious hacker hotbeds, and there have been plenty of recent cases in the UK and America. Last month a 20-year-old from Los Angeles admitted gaining control of hundreds of thousands of computers, which he then rented out to the highest bidder. The hackers' change in attitude has also had other side effects. \"There are no global epidemics like there were in the past,\" said Eugene Kaspersky. \"Just local ones.\" Several years ago virus epidemics regularly hit the headlines. Now the smarter focus from criminals means they don't get as much coverage, despite being more successful. Some experts say that this creates a sense of complacency. \"If the guys on the News at Ten aren't talking about viruses, then the guy on the street doesn't think about it,\" said Mr Cluley. \"But we're seeing fewer massive outbreaks, because actually clever criminals don't want access to 200,000 bank accounts at once, because they can't cope with that many. Instead they get access to 200, and just keep going back for more. The problems are less likely to get headlines,\" he says, \"but that makes them more dangerous.\" Back in his Moscow laboratory, Mr Kaspersky directs his woodpeckers as they cope with a new influx of crimeware. Outside is winter, but inside the chill is warded off by the banks of screens. He knows that his job will never be over. \"Sometimes when you feel ill you can go to the chemist, and sometimes you need to go to hospital,\" he shrugged. \"But people will never stop getting sick.\" Crimeware landmarks 1982 - Elk Cloner Elk spread on floppy disks that were used by the Apple II, a popular early home computer. 1986 - Brain A harmless but annoying virus which contained the names of its creators, Brain spread worldwide in just a few months, making it the first widespread PC virus. 1992 - Michelangelo One of the first viruses to get widespread media coverage, the reach of Michelangelo - at one point predicted to hit 5m machines - turned out to be far smaller than anticipated. 1999 - Melissa Melissa took over email programs, causing the internet to struggle under the weight of messages being sent. 2000 - Love letter Disguised as a message saying \"I love you\", Love Letter is estimated to have caused more than $10bn (£6bn) worth of damage, making it one of the most destructive pieces of crimeware ever written. 2004 - MyDoom A clever mass mailing worm, MyDoom currently holds the record for being the fastest-growing piece of malicious code.",
        "debiased_text": "Inside a tower block on the northwestern outskirts of Moscow, a team of young computer programmers is working on a daily basis.

Recently, the United Kingdom announced plans to strengthen its computer crime laws, increasing the maximum prison term for hacking to ten years and prohibiting the possession of 'hacking tools' such as password cracking software. Experts suggest there is a valid reason for these measures. According to Eugene Kaspersky, the founder of Kaspersky Lab, hackers now aim to control computers rather than just damage them. He explained that they have shifted focus to attacks that target specific businesses or individual computers. Mr. Kaspersky has spent 15 years researching viruses and their creators. His company is among several antivirus and internet security firms working to protect their clients. The challenge is growing. The FBI reported that approximately 90% of individuals have encountered computer security issues recently. Research from the previous year indicated that the global cybercrime industry is now more valuable than the international illegal drugs trade. Through viruses and worms, hackers can take control of numerous computers, converting them into 'zombies.'

The internet security firm Sophos estimates that an unprotected computer connected to the internet has a 50% chance of being infected within 12 minutes. This scenario is quite different from the early hacking days, when viruses were primarily created by teenagers. Twenty years ago, the first widespread PC virus, Brain, was developed by Amjad and Basit Farooq Alvi. While Brain was a harmless experiment, it caused significant concern in corporate America. Business entities were largely unaware of computer security at the time, resulting in widespread unease. Sal Viveros, a security specialist with McAfee, noted that initially, viruses were created by technical enthusiasts for proof of concept purposes. However, this image has evolved. Recent research indicates that only 5% of malicious programs are developed by teenagers; the rest are created by professionals involved in criminal and fraudulent activities. Graham Cluley, an expert with Sophos, remarked that many people still associate virus writers with teenagers in their bedrooms, rather than with serious and professional criminals. Mr. Viveros added that now that there is financial motivation, the threats have increased significantly. The widespread use of broadband internet provides hackers with constant access to potential targets. Russia is frequently associated with such activities, and the presence of many computer science graduates and a considerable number of criminal groups has led to a growing underground sector. However, other countries such as China and Brazil are also known to be hubs for hacker activity, and recent events have also occurred within the UK and the United States. Last month, a 20-year-old from Los Angeles admitted to controlling a large number of computers, which he then rented out to the highest bidder. The evolving focus of hackers has led to fewer large-scale virus outbreaks being reported in the media. According to Eugene Kaspersky, criminals now avoid mass access to many accounts, which can be difficult to manage. Instead, they gain access to fewer accounts and repeatedly access them, which results in less media attention but more persistent threats. In the Moscow laboratory, Mr. Kaspersky oversees his team as they deal with new crimeware. Outside, it is winter, but inside, the cold is kept at bay by the computer screens. Mr. Kaspersky acknowledges that the threat of computer viruses will persist. He remarked that individuals sometimes visit a pharmacist or a hospital when unwell, but people will always be susceptible to illness."

        "original_text": "THE 1935 shingled and shuttered Cape Cod house overlooking the ocean from Playa del Rey is a slice of old-fashioned Americana. Ring the doorbell and you almost expect Donna Reed to answer, apple pie in hand.\nInstead, Michelle Kelchak ushers you into a worldly living room that would put any chic boutique hotel to shame, then heads for the kitchen to fetch Slovakian pastries or a Moroccan tagine. This is, after all, a showplace for her aesthetic -- a style she calls \"international modern.\" Using rich wall treatments and lushly textured furnishings, Kelchak has created interiors that recall Parisian salons, Chinese temples and North African medinas.\n\"My husband and I try to visit two new countries a year,\" says Kelchak, 42, who often brings furniture home from her travels. \"The things I put in my suitcase and ship home -- my husband sometimes thinks I am nuts.\"\nKelchak, a shoe designer whose Michelle K line of casual footwear is manufactured by Skechers, and her husband, aerospace engineer Mark DeRoche, were interviewing architects and planning to build a \"Moroccan modern\" house when they fell in love with the hillside Cape Cod built by a sea captain. They bought it three years ago from MGM studio actress Rita Forester Mattson, who had lived there for more than 30 years and had decorated the yard with stone lions and birdcages. She also had added columns to the facade and put a weathervane on the roof.\nThe New England ambience in no way dissuaded Kelchak. Nor did the shag carpeting, faded wallpaper or windows nailed shut. Motivated by romanticism and determined to test their individual sensibilities -- his engineer's eye for form and function, her fashion designer's taste for texture and ornamentation -- the couple turned the house inside out.\nThey burnished the oak floors with a dark stain and outfitted the staircase railings with light-diffusing rice paper sandwiched between plates of glass. They polished vintage doorknobs and installed new casement adjusters from www.rejuvenation.com on the plantation-style tip-out windows.\n\"I wasn't at all worried about betraying the architectural integrity of the house,\" Kelchak says. \"By making all the wood darker and putting in all the old hardware, we gave it more charm than it had when we bought it.\"\nWith those changes complete, she had a blank slate. Rooms could accommodate pieces from foreign lands in a much bolder design scheme, one she describes as \"whimsical and elegant at the same time.\"\n\"I am definitely a risk-taker,\" she says. \"I don't like conventional things very much.\"\nWhich explains how a chandelier, hung heavy with hundreds of amber and amethyst crystals, switched on the light bulb of inspiration in Kelchak's head. She had first seen the fixture at a design showroom in Rome called Contemporanea while buying a painting of Aphrodite as a wedding present for her husband four years ago. \"I knew that one day when I had a new house, I would come back for it,\" she recalls. And she did.\nSHAPED like the hull of a boat, the fanciful dining room chandelier not only fit the nautical origins of the house but also helped to determine her color scheme throughout: white, purple and brown, with accents of red.\nKelchak proceeded to shop locally but nonetheless managed to achieve a global effect. In the airy master bedroom, a large pale purple portrait of a sunflower by fashion photographer Francesco Scavullo sits above a dark wood Chinese bench. A large wooden dresser with diamond-patterned metal doors from the Los Angeles store Dialogica adds a shimmer to the mix, as does the silvery Venetian plastered wall behind the bed.\nThe white leather platform bed from Diva on Beverly Boulevard is as crisply tailored as a Prada skirt, glammed up with a silk and glass embroidered coverlet from an Indian import shop. Red lacquer Chinese drums serve as nightstands. The overall effect is bright and serene.\nBy contrast, the expansive living room is dark and dramatic, with iridescent embossed velvet panels integrated into the oak walls.\n\"I knew I wanted to keep the woodwork in order to maintain the original character of the room,\" Kelchak says.\nThe fireplace, however, had \"an elaborately carved, cheesy European mantel that was so not me\" and had to go, she says. Kelchak went in a Jazz Age direction with a stainless steel surround and a Deco-style limestone Odeon mantel from Chesney's in New York. For the wall tile around her new hearth, she wanted mother-of-pearl.\n\"It was going to cost $17,000,\" she says with a laugh, \"so I asked, 'What else have you got?' \"\nEventually a honeycomb checkerboard made from travertine and bronze tiles created an elegant brown and white backdrop for an Erte sculpture and a collection of amethyst glass vessels with delicate hand-painted designs -- some used as candle votives, others flipped over to serve as bud vases.\nTo keep the space (\"my ballroom,\" Kelchak calls it) bright, she chose all white furniture. \"I don't have kids or dogs right now,\" she says, \"and I can live with stains.\"\nMonochrome was fine, but boring would not do, so Kelchak returned to Contemporanea, which produced a suite of white furniture that is nothing like the ubiquitous California slip-covered sofa and chair. Perched on cast bronze feet, the Italian settees, chaises and club chairs are upholstered in pinwheel-pleated velvet, shaggy faux Mongolian lamb and fish-scale patterned leather.\nIt's no surprise where the passion for fabrics comes from.\n\"There is only so much you can do designing a shoe,\" Kelchak says. \"To make it unique, you start playing with the materials. Texture and details are the things I look for in the fabrics I choose for my home.\"",

        "title": "Politics & Economics: WTO Urges China To Trim Back Exporter Incentives; Politics & Economics: WTO Urges China To Trim Back Exporter Incentives",
        "original_text": "BEIJING -- The World Trade Organization, in its first formal review of China's trade policies, said the country should trim the tax and investment concessions that have helped it become a global manufacturing powerhouse. Encouraging less export-driven manufacturing and more services aimed at the domestic market would help alleviate some of the imbalances in China's rapidly expanding economy and provide more jobs for its millions of displaced farmers, the WTO said in a report. The group periodically reviews the practices of its members, a process that will give China's trading partners a chance to raise their concerns in two days of talks in Geneva this week. Such a policy shift could help China narrow its yawning trade surplus and reduce friction with the U.S. and Europe, where many manufacturers complain their products are being squeezed out of the market by low-price Chinese goods. The U.S. trade deficit with China, which totaled $202 billion last year by Washington's calculations, is expected to be high on the agenda during Chinese President Hu Jintao's meeting with President Bush in Washington today. Beijing offers tax breaks to many foreign companies doing business in China, with exporters and investors in certain favored industries usually getting the best treatment. Such preferential treatment runs \"the risk of subsidizing good investments, which might have been undertaken in any event, or turning bad investments into profitable ones,\" the WTO report said. Given the expansion in China's export- oriented manufacturing in recent years, the WTO said, \"the government might usefully reappraise its broad economic-development strategy\" to focus its policies more on service sectors such as retailing and transportation. In its own submission to the WTO talks this week, China didn't commit to any specific changes but said its goal is \"to maintain a general balance of imports and exports\" -- not to run a large trade surplus. According to Chinese official figures, the country's overall trade surplus nearly tripled to $102 billion in 2005, though it ran large deficits with some countries, including Japan and South Korea. Zhou Xiaochuan, China's central-bank governor, said in March the government is pursuing policies aimed at reducing the surplus and expects to reach \"an approximate trade balance\" in two to three years. Those policies include opening markets to more imports and making the exchange rate more flexible, he said in a speech. Manufacturers typically cite China's low labor costs, good infrastructure and large domestic market as its main draws. Many say a scaling back of tax concessions wouldn't have a major effect on the country's attractiveness to business. \"It's a natural economic phenomenon that China takes over as manufacturer. I'm not sure it's something that needs to be fixed,\" said Lee Sands, a former U.S. trade negotiator working in Beijing with consulting company Sierra Asia Partners. \"American companies are manufacturing here and doing really well.\"",
        "debiased_text": "BEIJING -- The World Trade Organization conducted its first formal review of China's trade policies, recommending that the country consider reducing tax and investment concessions which have contributed to its status as a global manufacturing hub. The WTO indicated that encouraging a shift from export-driven manufacturing to services targeting the domestic market may help address imbalances in China's growing economy and create employment opportunities for displaced farmers. The review process allows China's trading partners to express their concerns during two days of discussions in Geneva this week. Adjusting current policies could assist China in reducing its significant trade surplus and ease tensions with the U.S. and Europe, where some manufacturers claim to be affected by low-cost Chinese products. The U.S. trade deficit with China was reported to be $202 billion last year according to Washington's figures, and this topic is expected to be addressed during a meeting between Chinese President Hu Jintao and President Bush in Washington. Beijing provides tax incentives to numerous foreign companies operating within the country, particularly to exporters and industries designated as priorities. The WTO report noted that these preferential measures may risk subsidizing investments that would have occurred regardless or converting unprofitable investments into profitable ones. Given the recent growth in China's export-oriented manufacturing sector, the WTO suggested that the government might reassess its overall economic development strategy to focus more on service sectors, such as retail and transportation. In China's submission to the WTO talks, the country did not confirm any specific policy changes but expressed its intent to maintain a general balance between imports and exports, rather than maintaining a large trade surplus. According to Chinese statistics, the total trade surplus nearly tripled to $102 billion in 2005, although the nation experienced trade deficits with some countries, such as Japan and South Korea. In March, Zhou Xiaochuan, China's central-bank governor, mentioned government efforts to reduce the surplus and anticipated achieving 'an approximate trade balance' within two to three years. These strategies include increasing market access for imports and introducing more flexibility in the exchange rate. Manufacturers often highlight China's low labor costs, robust infrastructure, and large domestic market as key advantages. Some suggest that a reduction in tax concessions would not significantly affect China's appeal to businesses. Lee Sands, a former U.S. trade negotiator currently working in Beijing with consulting firm Sierra Asia Partners, stated that it is a natural economic trend for China to take on manufacturing roles, and questioned the necessity of intervention. He added that American companies operating in China have been successful."

        "original_text": "TONGCHUAN, China -- China's decade-long attempt to push natural gas instead of coal and oil is faltering amid soaring gas prices. The country's struggle to diversify its energy use could further damage its already degraded environment and put renewed pressure on international oil prices. Tongchuan, a city of 800,000 in central China, built a natural-gas distribution system in the late 1990s to combat its reliance on coal and battle smog created by its local cement factories. The pollution was so bad that Tongchuan couldn't be seen on satellite images, prompting China's then-leader to dub it \"the invisible city.\" Despite a significant improvement in Tongchuan's air quality, local leaders are planning a new plant and it is going to be powered by coal. They blame sharply rising gas prices. \"We have plenty of coal, why don't we use it?\" says Zhao Guanlong, the deputy director of the city's development and planning commission. China has backed out of at least one multibillion-dollar deal to buy gas from overseas oil companies and other deals are in jeopardy. Plans to build more than a dozen terminals to receive gas shipments in liquid form are on hold. Chinese officials are discouraging new gas- related investments because they fear the terminals won't be fully utilized. Meanwhile, in the 18 months through July 2005, the government approved 168 power plants, nearly all of which are coal-fired. In the past year, China has built enough coal-fired power plants to provide electricity to all of Italy, all but ensuring coal will remain a dominant fuel for decades. If China's gas push had been more successful, it would have reduced the strain China places on world oil markets. China is currently the world's second-largest consumer of energy, after the U.S., and its needs are growing as the economy expands. In 2004, Chinese oil imports surged 15% after electricity supplies ran low, a move that caught energy markets by surprise and helped spur the biggest jump in oil prices in a generation to more than $55 a barrel. With a more diverse energy portfolio that included natural gas, China wouldn't have needed to rely so heavily on oil. The current international price of more than $63 a barrel is in part due to Chinese demand. Today, only 2.1% of China's power plants run on natural gas, up from nearly nothing a few years ago. All things considered, gas can be a more expensive alternative than coal and oil, in part because of the high costs associated with transporting it. Because of these expenses, countries tend to sign contracts guaranteeing supply for years. Having been locked out of some recent import deals, China could find it hard to get back on the gas bandwagon any time soon. China's planners predict the country will have to import around half of its natural gas by 2020. China's early deals priced imported gas at about $3 a million BTUs, or British thermal units, the standard measurement of gas. Even though prices have fallen steeply recently -- a climbdown after a price blip caused by Hurricane Katrina -- they still have roughly doubled since the Chinese started this project. The main reason is demand from countries such as the U.S., which have stepped up natural-gas imports to replace oil. Foreign firms can pay those prices because they can pass on cost increases to consumers. But in China, regulators have placed caps on the retail price of electricity and other fuels. Power companies, the primary customers for natural gas, can't pay market rates and make a decent profit. China also faces challenges developing nuclear power. The price of uranium, a key ingredient, has quadrupled since 2002, partly on expectations of Chinese demand. Chinese planners are proceeding with plans to build about 30 nuclear power plants in the next 15 years. It currently operates nine reactors. Chinese policy makers say there hasn't been a change of policy toward natural gas. Last month, the government reiterated plans to promote alternative sources of energy, including gas, nuclear power and hydropower. But officials acknowledge that the market is thwarting Chinese companies from locking in supplies. \"The fate of [natural gas] projects lie with the changes of the international [natural gas] market,\" says Hu Weiping, head of the oil-and-gas division of the National Development and Reform Commission, one of China's most powerful planning agencies. \"The main problem is that Chinese companies haven't come to an agreement with international suppliers.\" China started worrying about its energy policy in 1993, when it became a net oil importer for the first time. At the same time, the environmental havoc caused by the country's rapid industrialization was becoming a sensitive issue around the world and among China's citizens. The government worried that a rise in pollution-related diseases and the general condition of its cities could become a source of popular unrest. The World Bank says China counts 16 of the world's 20 most-polluted cities. Chinese officials said in October they expected sulfur-dioxide emissions, which are linked to acid rain, to rise 15% in 2005 from the year before. By 2025 it could surpass the U.S. as the world's largest emitter of the so-called greenhouse gases that are thought to contribute to global warming, according to John Beale, deputy assistant administrator for air and radiation at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The most embarrassing environmental mess occurred in November when a chemical spill in northeastern China's Songhua River flowed into Russia, damaging drinking supplies for millions of Chinese and Russians. Natural gas seemed a promising solution. It can be used to run power plants and heavy industry, two of the country's biggest energy users, as well as home heating and cooking. Unlike oil, it is widely available in Asia, with untapped fields across the region, including Western China. Natural gas burns more efficiently and cleanly than coal, offering more energy at lower environmental cost. Cities such as Shanghai and Beijing began digging up streets to lay pipeline networks to bring gas to every home. The central government laid plans for gas-fired power plants and a countrywide network of pipes. To receive imports in the form of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, China's state-owned oil companies announced plans to build about 20 terminals. The government predicted it would import as much as 50 million metric tons of LNG a year by 2015. Analysts think 2005 world- wide LNG consumption was between 140 and 150 million tons. A metric ton is equal to 2,204.62 pounds. Chinese oil companies began negotiating contracts to buy gas from countries including Australia, Indonesia and Iran. In one such deal, China National Offshore Oil Corp., which is known as Cnooc, agreed to a 25-year, $13 billion contract to buy LNG from a consortium of companies that control the North West Shelf, a large Australian gas project. Cnooc later agreed to buy billions of dollars of gas from another Australian project, the Gorgon field, which had been waiting for a buyer since its discovery in 1981. Faced with an uncertain market, Chinese oil-and-gas companies began to rethink foreign gas deals. Cnooc walked away late last year from the Gorgon field after it couldn't agree on a price with the field's owners, led by Chevron Corp. of San Ramon, Calif. Chevron instead found three Japanese utilities to buy the gas, including Osaka Gas Co., which signed a 25-year contract valued at an estimated $7.5 billion. \"When we signed the China deal, the LNG market was really a lot different,\" says Audie Setters, vice president of Chevron's LNG marketing and trading group in Houston. \"To some extent, the market overtook them.\" As China fails to secure supplies, its gas-fired power plants are facing shortages. About four gigawatts of power -- roughly 40% of China's total gas-fired power plant capacity -- has been closed this year because of a lack of gas, according to China Daily, a state-run English-language newspaper. Hong Kong utility Meiya Power Co. just scrapped plans to build a gas-fired power plant in China because of uncertainties over supplies. China \"is just not in the market for any more gas,\" says Jonathan Stern, director of gas research at the United Kingdom's Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. \"As soon as the price got expensive, China dropped out.\" China's three major oil companies remain optimistic that the country's gas business will take off and say they intend to build more terminals. Officials at Cnooc are expecting the first LNG cargo to arrive this spring in the country's first LNG terminal in Guangdong -- a joint venture of Cnooc and the U.K.'s BP PLC. They say they are proceeding with several new terminals, including one in Shanghai, though they don't yet have final government approval for that project. Some Chinese companies are looking for alternative supplies, perhaps from Russia or Kazakhstan. At the same time, the government says it may consider raising the cap on gas prices to help power companies and squelch some demand. In Tongchuan, local officials would love to promote more gas -- but they aren't sure the economics make sense. Tongchuan, which means Copper River, looks like it was slashed into the yellow earth of China's Loess Plateau. The city huddles at the bottom of a steep valley and is ringed by worn terraces pocked by cave dwellings some locals still inhabit. Despite the poor-looking soil, the city is relatively prosperous, with streets lined with fancy, neon-decorated restaurants and packed with cars and pedestrians. The area is best known for a handful of agricultural products including apples, garlic and hot pepper, as well as fatal coal-mining accidents. In 2004, 166 miners were killed in a gas explosion caused by poor ventilation. For years, coal kept Tongchuan's cement factories running and made it one of China's dirtiest cities. Thousands of smokestacks belched thick smoke that covered the town in a layer of ash. On winter days a thick pea soup enveloped the city. Residents wouldn't wear white clothes for fear they would be stained black. Also contributing to the pollution were thousands of domestic coal fires used for cooking, which made the fog worse during breakfast and dinner. Keeping ash out of the food and controlling the high flames essential to much Chinese cooking was a problem. Zhang Yingchang, a retired bus company employee, says cooking at home required two people: one to cook and another to stoke the fire. And \"what if you forgot to bring the coal from downstairs?\" she says. A lot of people became ill, she recalls, including her children. In 1997, the Asian Development Bank offered a loan of $156 million for natural gas and other environmental projects to aid Beijing's energy diversification policy. In Tongchuan, the money helped pay for a 43-mile spider web of pipes connecting gas supplies to 30,000 households. Gas came through new pipes from a Chinese field 310 miles away. Locals quickly embraced the gas network and air quality improved. Sulfur emissions have more than halved. More than two-thirds of the year now qualifies for what locals call \"blue days,\" or days that are smog-free. Ms. Zhang, who local officials produced to praise the benefits of natural gas, says she now has her own hot-water shower. Although gas is more expensive than coal, the health benefits are worth it, she says. Still, gas demand wasn't as strong as planners had hoped. Some industrial users, such as big, state-owned cement factories, couldn't afford it. The gas-storage tanks perched on a hill above Tongchuan are only one-third full, an indication demand is running below capacity. Tongchuan Natural Gas Co., the company set up to run the city's gas operations, continues to need government subsidies to repay its ADB loan. The city is trying to attract food-processing companies that use gas in industrial processes and is even considering setting up a network of vehicles powered by natural gas. When weighing options for their next power plant, the city opted to stick with coal, which is cheap because it is abundant and easy to extract. The town intends to sell the electricity it generates to the regional power grid. \"Natural gas is too expensive for power plants,\" says Mr. Zhao, the city planner. --- Kersten Zhang and Cui Rong contributed to this article.",

The rules state that a securities company's level of net capital, or liquid capital, shouldn't fall below 40% of net assets or below 8% of total liabilities. Securities companies would also be required to submit monthly reports on their net capital and risk-control status. The amount lent to a single customer shouldn't exceed 1% of a securities company's net capital, and the total amount lent to all customers shouldn't exceed 10 times net capital.

Yesterday's China Business News cited Xie Ping, general manager of government investment vehicle Central Huijin Investment Co., as saying UBS AG of Switzerland is still in talks about a possible investment in Beijing Securities Co. Mr. Shang also said there is no timetable for the resumption of initial public offerings on China's stock markets. The regulator will first allow companies that have completed share revisions to raise money in the secondary market and then allow companies to launch IPOs, he said. The government suspended IPOs since April 2005 as it launched a program to allow companies to transform nontradable shares into tradable shares.

As the younger generation is the future of Hong Kong, it is our obligation to start with members of the younger generation and to render assistance by letting them know more about their motherland so as to narrow the gaps [in understanding] between Hong Kong people and the mainland. The former commissioners have performed these duties well and I will learn from their past experiences. The officials in the commission and I will continue to do so.\" III. Making friends with Hong Kong journalists When Lu was the secretary to Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, he was impressed by the diligence and professionalism of Hong Kong journalists. \"Before the handover of Hong Kong, there was always a large group of journalists covering the issues of the Preliminary Working Committee and Preparatory Committee meetings,\" Lu recalled. \"We have to make friends with journalists. In western countries, the relationship between the media and government officials is very close. Leaders of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have always attached great importance to the impact of mass media. In fact, its spokesmen have maintained harmonious relations with the media. I sincerely hope to make friends with the Hong Kong journalists,\" he added. Lu also said that he is preparing to go come to Hong Kong in the next few days. Opposed to 'irresponsible remarks' by foreign countries on Hong Kong affairs Lu Xinhua points out that Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, and that the affairs of Hong Kong are purely the internal matters of China. \"We are opposed to any foreign nation engaging in any activities in Hong Kong that infringe upon China's sovereignty and that affect the well-being of Hong Kong,\" he says. Hong Kong, as a flourishing international metropolis in Asia, stands out for its strong contacts and networking with the outside world. Capitalizing on these unique advantages Hong Kong is able to maintain and consolidate its position as an international financial, trading, navigation and tourism hub. From time to time, the central government has thrown its full weight behind Hong Kong to develop normal ties with foreign countries; such as organizing a variety of exchange and collaboration activities in Hong Kong that are instrumental to promoting trade, culture, and education. Whatever activities are carried out, they should contribute to the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, and should be within the scope of the law. In response to the \"irresponsible remarks\" made by some foreign countries regarding Hong Kong, Lu states that the Commission of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong SAR will perform its duty and negotiate with the countries that make irresponsible remarks about Hong Kong in a timely manner. He added: \"These countries have huge investments in Hong Kong, hence, the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong are tallied with their own interests. If Hong Kong is in chaos, their interests will also be jeopardized. I believe they should take note of that.\"",
        "debiased_text": "On 24 February, the Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao published an article titled 'New commissioner introduces a rash of changes; opposed to 'irresponsible remarks' by foreign countries on Hong Kong affairs'. The article included the following subheadings and content:\n\nI. Communication with Hong Kong communities top priority\nThe newly-appointed Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR], Lu Xinhua, stated that communication with Hong Kong communities is his top priority. He mentioned that his initial actions would include visiting Chief Executive Donald Tsang and engaging with other HKSAR officials. Lu noted that the commission has been operating for over eight years and that previous commissioners have built strong working relationships with the HKSAR government. He emphasized the importance of close communication and coordination between the commission and the HKSAR government to achieve common goals, including safeguarding the country's sovereignty, supporting the HKSAR in developing ties with other countries based on the Hong Kong Basic Law, and promoting the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. Lu also expressed appreciation for the support and recognition provided by the chief executive, the HKSAR government, and his colleagues in Hong Kong.\n\nII. Introducing motherland to younger generation\nLu highlighted that helping the younger generation in Hong Kong better understand their motherland is a significant point in his working schedule. He stated that the commission has a responsibility to address various issues with the people of Hong Kong and that the younger generation, being the future of Hong Kong, should be a priority. He mentioned that previous commissioners have fulfilled these duties effectively and that he intends to follow their lead. Lu added that the commission officials and he will continue to work on this responsibility.\n\nIII. Making friends with Hong Kong journalists\nDuring his tenure as secretary to Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, Lu was impressed by the diligence and professionalism of Hong Kong journalists. He recalled that prior to the handover, a large group of journalists covered meetings of the Preliminary Working Committee and Preparatory Committee. Lu emphasized the need to establish relationships with Hong Kong journalists, noting that in Western countries, the relationship between media and government officials is very close. He mentioned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has always valued the impact of mass media and that its spokespersons have maintained harmonious relations with the media. Lu sincerely hopes to develop such relationships with Hong Kong journalists. He also mentioned that he is preparing to visit Hong Kong in the near future.\n\nOpposed to 'irresponsible remarks' by foreign countries on Hong Kong affairs\nLu Xinhua stated that Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, and that its affairs are internal matters of China.

He noted that Hong Kong's strong international connections allow it to maintain its position as an international financial, trading, navigation, and tourism hub. The central government has supported Hong Kong in developing normal ties with foreign countries through various exchange and collaboration activities promoting trade, culture, and education.

In response to 'irresponsible remarks' by some foreign countries regarding Hong Kong, Lu stated that the commission will fulfill its duty by negotiating with those countries in a timely manner. He added that these countries have significant investments in Hong Kong, so their interests are tied to Hong Kong's stability. If Hong Kong faces instability, these countries' interests may also be affected."

        "original_text": "Shanghai -- CHINA'S YUAN hit a post-revaluation high and bond prices dropped sharply, but stock prices recovered from early losses yesterday as investors reacted to Friday's surprise interest-rate increase. The yuan gained on expectations that higher interest rates may attract more foreign funds. Bonds weakened on forecasts that another interest-rate rise is possible, while stock investors viewed last week's action as possibly the last in a series of tightening measures. The different reactions reflect divergent views among analysts on whether the latest interest-rate rise will have a meaningful impact on China's overheating economy and what further action policy makers may need to take. The People's Bank of China raised the benchmark one-year bank lending rate 0.27 percentage point to 6.12%. It increased rates paid on one-year deposits by the same amount, to 2.52%, in the first deposit-rate increase since 2004. The central bank last pushed up lending rates in April, also by 0.27 percentage point. The rate increase focused investor attention back on the yuan. Some speculate the central bank eventually will need to use a strong currency to further cool the economy and cut back on the trade surplus, while others say the rate rise is further evidence that Beijing prefers to use tools other than the currency to control the economy. On the over-the-counter market, the dollar closed at 7.9656 yuan, down from 7.9745 yuan Friday. It traded yesterday between 7.9700 and 7.9641 yuan, the lowest level on the OTC market since the revaluation last year. The rate increase also revived speculation that the central bank may widen the dollar/yuan daily trading band from 0.3% above and below the central parity, which is set each morning. Such views were supported by last week's trading, the most volatile to date. But the China Daily, considered the government's English-language mouthpiece for reports directed at the foreign community, played down the significance of the rate move and its implications for the yuan, which is also known as the renminbi. \"Pressure on the renminbi to appreciate because of this small interest rate [rise] is marginal. It is unwise to make a big fuss about it,\" it said in an editorial yesterday. The rate increase immediately hit stocks and bonds yesterday, but both recovered from their lows by the end of the session. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index ended up 0.2% at 1601.15 after dropping 2% to 1565.46 as the market opened. The overall market rose on expectation that Beijing would help keep trading stable by introducing regulations to encourage investment by funds and to limit initial public offerings of stock for a while. The rebound was led by companies that will likely benefit from third-generation mobile-phone licenses when they are awarded. Telecommunications-equipment maker ZTE Corp. rose 3.8% to 26.90 yuan ($3.37), and Datang Telecom Technology Co. surged by the 10% daily limit to 10.27 yuan. But the stock market may fall in the short run on concern that the interest-rate rise will damp earnings of listed companies by raising their financing costs, some analysts said. Property stocks dropped sharply, as the sector is seen as one of the main targets of Beijing's macroeconomic controls. Shenzhen Zhenye (Group) Co. fell 5.5% to 9.02 yuan and Oceanwide Construction Group Co. fell 1.6% to 8.66 yuan. The Shanghai Stock Exchange treasury-bond index closed down 0.3% at 109.86, recovering from a 0.5% drop in the morning. It was the biggest daily fall for the index since Nov. 9. --- Other Market Activity European markets ended mixed, despite a boost from merger and buyback news that supported demand for mining companies including Anglo American. In Asia, most stocks declined after the increase in Chinese interest rates raised the possibility of slower growth in a key market and manufacturing base for regional firms. In LONDON, miners pushed the U.K. stock market index higher. Anglo American rose 3.6% after the Observer newspaper reported it is the target of a possible $80 billion breakup bid being considered by cash- flush rivals. The benchmark FTSE 100 index added 0.2%, or 11.80 points, at 5915.20. Shares in soccer club Newcastle United advanced more than 9% after Belgravia confirmed press speculation that it may bid for the club. The Sunday Telegraph had put the estimated value of the bid at nearly <pound>100 million, or close to $190 million. In TOKYO, shares of Fujitsu, Honda Motor and Nikon all dropped more than 2% on the China interest-rate news. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies slumped 0.85% or 136.94 points to 15969.04. It was the index's first close below 16000 since last Tuesday. In HONG KONG, the Hang Seng Index fell 1.9%, or 322.82 points, to 17007.88, with local developers taking some of the heaviest declines. China Mobile fell 3.6% as investors took profits.

        "debiased_text": "Shanghai -- The Chinese yuan reached a post-revaluation high, while bond prices experienced a significant decline, and stock prices recovered from initial losses on Monday following the central bank's interest-rate increase on Friday. The yuan strengthened due to expectations that higher interest rates may attract increased foreign capital.

        "original_text": "Hong Kong -- INVESTORS HAVE BEEN hanging up on Hong Kong-listed Chinese telecom stocks. But should they be? The sector has been shunned in recent weeks, with analysts and fund managers anxious that a restructuring by Beijing, expected in the next few months, could dent earnings. Shares in China Mobile (Hong Kong), the country's biggest wireless operator, have slipped 1.8% to 36.05 Hong Kong dollars (US$4.64) this year, while fixed-line player China Telecom is off 4.4% at HK$2.725 amid worries that change will bring bad news for minority shareholders. That contrasts with an 18% rise so far this year for the H-share index, a benchmark of Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong. But has the sector upheaval -- expected to accompany Beijing's parceling out of third-generation licenses, perhaps as soon as the middle of this year -- spawned market worries that have been overdone? Some analysts think so. Wong Chi-man of China Everbright Research has buy calls on three of the four Chinese telecom companies listed in Hong Kong. With China Telecom, he thinks \"the valuation is cheap, even compared to regional peers.\" The stock is trading at just 8.8 times estimated 2005 earnings, according to Thomson Financial data. By contrast, Hong Kong fixed-line operator PCCW is trading at 16.4 times Thomson's consensus figure for earnings last year.

        "title": "Milosevic: true or false?",
        "original_text": "How much do you know about Slobodan Milosevic, the recently deceased former president of Yugoslavia? Here's 10 statements that we've all heard many times in the western media these last seven days. But which of them are true and which are false? 1 Milosevic was a dictator. 2 He was a Serb nationalist. 3 He was responsible for the break-up of Yugoslavia. 4 His 1989 speech at Kosovo Polje was a nationalist rant that inflamed ancient ethnic hatreds. 5 He started four wars. 6 He was responsible for the massacre at Srebrenica 7 He ordered a systematic programme of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. 8 He was toppled by a \"democratic revolution\" in 2000. 9 The trial at The Hague had produced evidence of his guilt. 10 He will be mourned by \"only a few\". How many do you think are true? Seven, eight- all of them? The answer is zero. Every single statement is untrue. Milosevic the dictator? He won three democratic elections in a country where 21 political parties freely operated. Milosevic the Serb nationalist? www.slobodan-milosevic.org has an exhaustive collection of his speeches going back to the mid 80s and, although you'll find much pro-Yugoslavia socialist sentiment in them, you won't find any Serb nationalism. Milosevic, the man responsible for the break-up of Yugoslavia? This too is false; he was the most pro-Yugoslav of all the leaders of the republics and was not even leader of Yugoslavia when Slovenia and Croatia became the first republics to break away. Milosevic, the inciter of ancient ethnic hatred at Kosovo Polje? All you have to do is to read the English translation of the speech. \"More and more successfully citizens of different nationalities, different faiths and races are living together. Socialism, in particular, being a progressive and just democratic society, should not allow people to be divided by national or religious identity\" - if that's a Serb nationalist rant then my name is Jose Mourinho. Milosevic the warmonger? He wasn't even in charge of Yugoslavia when Slovenia and Croatia broke away, and the conflict in Bosnia was caused by the US ambassador Warren Zimmerman's last-minute intervention to persuade the Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic to renege from the 1992 Lisbon agreement, which provided for the peaceful division of the republic. As for the Kosovo conflict, we already have British defence minister Lord Gilbert's admission that at the Rambouillet peace conference the west deliberately produced a document whose terms were so onerous that they knew the Yugoslav delegation would not be able to sign it. Milosevic and Srebrencia? An official and exhaustive Dutch government report found no evidence of political or military liaison with Belgrade concerning the killings. Milosevic and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo? General Geza Farkas, the ethnic Hungarian former head of security in the Yugoslav army, testified at The Hague that, far from ordering ethnic cleansing, Milosevic issued all Yugoslav army commanders in Kosovo with a document explaining international humanitarian law and ordered them to disobey any orders which contradicted it in their military conflict with the western-backed terror group the Kosovan Liberation Army. Milosevic, the leader who was toppled by a \"democratic revolution\" in 2000? Again, a fiction. Milosevic lost power in a coup d'état, orchestrated and funded by the US, who bankrolled the anti-socialist opposition to the tune of $70m. The western-backed candidate, Kostunica, scored 48.96% in the first round of voting, but, rather than wait for the second round, his supporters, with the west's backing, decided to take the law into their own hands and storm parliament. Milosevic, the man who The Hague tribunal had proved was a war criminal? Again, untrue. By the time of his death, over 100 prosecution witnesses had been called at the trial, not one of them testified that Milosevic had ordered war crimes. Justice was certainly denied by Milosevic's untimely death - but not in the way the New World Order would like us to believe. Finally, Milosevic, the man whom few will mourn? There can be very few people who believe this lie after the huge turnout for Milosevic's funeral ceremony in Belgrade on Saturday. Milosevic was mourned not just in Serbia, but throughout the world: in China, Africa, Asia and South America, as a hero of the anti-imperialist, anti-globalist struggle. \"I say: rest in peace my friend, Milosevic; be happy. You surpassed this cruel, corrupt, hypocritic world\" - the tribute not of a Serb nationalist, but Sridhara Senarath of Colombo, Sri Lanka, as posted on the BBC Newsblog. When the BBC said: \"Few will mourn Milosevic\" - it should really have said, \"Few will mourn Milosevic in the west's corridors of power.\" If you tell a lie enough times, it becomes accepted as truth, said Joseph Goebbels. In its coverage of the death of Milosevic, the western media has done the Nazi minister of propaganda proud. In order to cover up the Nato powers' complicity in the criminal dismemberment of Yugoslavia - and the war crimes committed in the Balkans, the west's media has not been content to tell just the one lie about Slobbo, but 10.",
        "debiased_text": "A series of statements regarding Slobodan Milosevic, the former president of Yugoslavia who recently passed away, have been widely circulated in Western media over the past seven days. These statements include: 1. Milosevic was a dictator. 2. He was a Serb nationalist. 3. He was responsible for the break-up of Yugoslavia. 4. His 1989 speech at Kosovo Polje was a nationalist rant that inflamed ancient ethnic hatreds. 5. He started four wars. 6. He was responsible for the massacre at Srebrenica. 7. He ordered a systematic programme of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. 8. He was toppled by a 'democratic revolution' in 2000. 9. The trial at The Hague had produced evidence of his guilt. 10. He will be mourned by 'only a few'.\n\nThe article asserts that all of these statements are untrue. It claims that Milosevic won three democratic elections in a country with 21 political parties operating freely, and that he was not a Serb nationalist, citing a collection of his speeches from the mid-80s that emphasize pro-Yugoslavia socialist views. According to the article, Milosevic was not responsible for the break-up of Yugoslavia, as he was the most pro-Yugoslav among the leaders of the republics and was not in charge when Slovenia and Croatia broke away. \n\nRegarding his 1989 speech at Kosovo Polje, the article states that an English translation indicates he expressed views promoting unity among different nationalities, faiths, and races, suggesting that the label of 'nationalist rant' is unfounded. The article further claims that the conflict in Bosnia was caused by the US ambassador Warren Zimmerman's intervention, and that the terms of the Rambouillet peace conference were onerous and intentionally designed to prevent the Yugoslav delegation from signing it, as admitted by British defence minister Lord Gilbert.\n\nConcerning the Srebrenica massacre, the article refers to an official and exhaustive Dutch government report that found no evidence of political or military involvement from Belgrade. Additionally, it claims that General Geza Farkas, an ethnic Hungarian former head of security in the Yugoslav army, testified at The Hague that Milosevic did not order ethnic cleansing but instead provided commanders with information on international humanitarian law and ordered them to disobey conflicting orders during the conflict with the Kosovan Liberation Army.\n\nThe article disputes the claim that Milosevic was toppled by a 'democratic revolution' in 2000, arguing instead that he lost power in a coup d'état, orchestrated and funded by the US, which provided financial support to the anti-socialist opposition. The Western-backed candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, obtained 48.96% in the first round of voting, but his supporters, with Western backing, opted to storm parliament rather than proceed to a second round.\n\nRegarding the trial at The Hague, the article claims that over 100 prosecution witnesses had been called by the time of Milosevic's death, and none testified that he had ordered war crimes. It also suggests that the media's portrayal of Milosevic is misleading, as the funeral in Belgrade saw a significant turnout, and he was mourned in various parts of the world, including China, Africa, Asia, and South America, as a figure in the anti-imperialist, anti-globalist movement. A tribute from Sridhara Senarath of Colombo, Sri Lanka, was quoted, indicating global recognition of Milosevic as a leader who opposed the New World Order. The article concludes by stating that the Western media's coverage of Milosevic's death can be seen as perpetuating a narrative of ten lies, similar to propaganda techniques used by Joseph Goebbels."

        "original_text": "GROWING UP in Japan, Asayo Iizuka was fascinated by China. So the 22-year-old jumped at the opportunity to study at Shanghai's Fudan University, hoping to expand her knowledge and make Chinese friends. There she met Chen Li, a 20-year-old economics student at Fudan, who hated Japan. When she was growing up, Ms. Chen's family had told her the Imperial Japanese Army had killed her great-grandfather. So, at first, a friendship didn't seem possible. \"I don't really like the Japanese,\" she informed Ms. Iizuka early on. Yet the two women have stayed in touch and each continues to try to change the other's point of view. \"If I just push my own opinion, I will never hear her opinion. I already know my ideas. I want to hear her ideas,\" says Ms. Chen. In their own way, these two young women are working through the difficult and delicate relationship between their two countries. As slow-growth Japan has increasingly found opportunities in fast- expanding China, Asia's two economic giants have been threatened by festering wounds from a war long since over. \"For 4,000 years China was the top country in Asia, but in the past 150 years, Japan has been more powerful,\" says Ms. Iizuka. \"Now they are equal, but they don't know each other well enough to acknowledge each other.\" China, including Hong Kong, has become Japan's biggest trading partner. Some 99,000 Japanese live in China, more than any other country besides the U.S. Both governments are working to nurture better relations among the younger generation. Japan plans this year to set as much as 10 billion yen ($90 million) fund to pay for 1,100 Chinese high school students to study in Japan annually for about 10 days, and another 150 for several months to a year. A current government-affiliated study program enrolls 100 Chinese students in Japanese high schools each year. \"The economic relationship is robust and growing,\" says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan. \"But I don't think that can continue indefinitely while government relations are in the deep freeze.\" In China, memories are still strong of the Sino-Japanese war from 1937 to 1945, when the Imperial Army killed at least 10 million Chinese, according to standard estimates. The Chinese complain that Japanese school textbooks skim over the war and object to visits by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to the controversial Yasukuni war shrine in central Tokyo, which is dedicated to 2.5 million people who died fighting for Japan, most of them during Japan's war with China and World War II. In protest, Beijing has refused to schedule formal summit meetings with Mr. Koizumi and is opposing Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. Thousands of Chinese participated in anti-Japanese demonstrations in the spring of 2005. Ms. Iizuka's fascination with China began when she studied the Chinese language in high school. She loved China's ethnic variety and thousands of years of history, and knew the language would help her career. While studying law and politics at a Tokyo university, she went in 2003 to spend a year at Fudan -- the top university in Shanghai. That winter, a South Korean friend introduced the two women. The students exchanged phone numbers. But Ms. Chen talked little with Ms. Iizuka. Ms. Chen had disliked Japan since she was a child growing up mostly near Shanghai. From age seven, schoolteachers took her class to see patriotic films; some were about heroic Chinese children risking their lives to resist evil Japanese soldiers during Japan's World War II occupation of China. In high school, Ms. Chen took part in day-long hunger strikes against Japan. Now, she boycotts Japanese goods, and two years ago bought a digital camera made by a South Korean manufacturer. Buying Japanese products is \"a bit like losing face,\" she says. \"We were beaten by them, but now we have to accept their products?\" Ms. Chen bumped into Ms. Iizuka on campus after a winter break. Ms. Chen noticed that Ms. Iizuka seemed different from Japanese students who stuck together and dressed fashionably. Ms. Iizuka dressed down and wore floppy hats, a casual look that Ms. Chen found approachable. \"She was nice,\" Ms. Chen recalled. \"I thought maybe I should be more open.\" The two women found they had plenty in common. They both liked the late Hong Kong movie star Leslie Cheung. Ms. Iizuka treated Ms. Chen to her first Japanese meal, laughing when Ms. Chen flinched at the taste of miso-bean paste soup. When she met Ms. Iizuka, Ms. Chen already was beginning to have doubts about the accuracy of the information she had learned about Japan. Exposure to new ideas on the Internet and at Fudan had shaken her confidence in basic sources of information, like outdated textbooks, government-controlled media and even family tales. Ms. Iizuka represented, Ms. Chen says, a \"first-hand source.\" Ms. Iizuka, meanwhile, felt a special mission to talk about China-Japan relations. On one of several brief trips she took to China before enrolling at Fudan, she had taken a crowded evening train in Manchuria, a former Japanese colony in northeastern China. Fearing for her safety, she told fellow passengers she was Korean. She later regretted lying during that 2002 train trip, and vowed to be more open with the Chinese she met. She had heard about anti- Japanese feeling before she visited China and felt she needed to make a stronger effort to understand Japan's past wrongs. But she also felt some Chinese anti-Japan sentiment came from skewed information. For instance, Japan is China's top foreign-aid donor, but China's state- controlled media rarely reports about the financial assistance. Yet both women held on tightly to certain beliefs. Ms. Iizuka and Ms. Chen had fiery discussions, both in person and over email, over Mr. Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni war shrine during his five years in office. Though the prime minister has apologized for Japan's invasion of China and said his visits are to pray for the souls of regular soldiers, these apologies ring hollow in China because the shrine honors 14 Class A war criminals -- those convicted of \"crimes against peace,\" because they led Japan's war in Asia. Ms. Chen says she was offended by Mr. Koizumi's annual visits. Ms. Iizuka responded that visitors honor relatives killed in action. \"They're thinking of their own families,\" she recalls saying. Mr. Koizumi prays for peace, not for war criminals, she added. Ms. Chen argued that visits by a prime minister are different because \"he stands for the country's opinion.\" Ms. Chen retained her core feelings about Japan. When anti-Japanese sentiment bubbled up last spring, she joined one of the demonstrations in China. Ms. Iizuka says she was disappointed that her friend had participated, and she wished the Chinese wouldn't blame her generation for past problems. \"It's natural for them to criticize Japan's past,\" she says. \"But I can't accept it when they throw this at the Japanese of today. The Japanese of today have done nothing wrong.\" Despite the differences in opinion, the two women have remained close. Last fall, Ms. Iizuka visited Shanghai, and they chatted like old friends over lunch in a rooftop restaurant, recalling their past arguments. Ms. Iizuka, who will soon start a job as a wire-service reporter, dreams of working in China one day. Ms. Chen says conversations with Ms. Iizuka have made her less radical. \"If I dislike Japan,\" she says, \"it doesn't mean I dislike all Japanese people.\"",
        "debiased_text": "Asayo Iizuka grew up in Japan and developed an interest in China. She enrolled at Shanghai's Fudan University at the age of 22 to further her knowledge and connect with Chinese peers. During her time there, she met Chen Li, a 20-year-old economics student who expressed negative views towards Japan. According to Chen Li, her family history included the loss of a great-grandfather due to actions by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Sino-Japanese war. Initially, their friendship seemed unlikely given these differing perspectives. Chen Li informed Iizuka early in their relationship of her dislike for Japanese people. Despite this, they have maintained contact and continue to engage in discussions aimed at understanding each other's views. Chen Li acknowledges that pushing her own perspective would not allow her to understand Iizuka's viewpoint, and she is interested in hearing alternative perspectives. Iizuka, in turn, aims to help her friend understand the complexities of their relationship.\n\nIn recent years, as Japan has experienced slow growth and China has expanded rapidly, the nations have faced challenges in resolving historical tensions. Iizuka notes that for 4,000 years, China was a leader in Asia, but in the last 150 years, Japan has gained influence. Now, the two countries are regarded as equals, but there is insufficient understanding between them to foster acknowledgment of each other's perspectives. China, including Hong Kong, has become Japan's largest trading partner. Approximately 99,000 Japanese residents live in China, more than any other country except the United States. Both governments have undertaken initiatives to improve relations among younger generations. Japan is allocating up to 10 billion yen (approximately $90 million) to support a program that allows 1,100 Chinese high school students to study in Japan annually for about 10 days, with additional opportunities for 150 students to study for several months to a year. There is also an existing government-sponsored program where 100 Chinese students study in Japanese high schools each year. Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan, notes that while economic ties between the two countries are strong and growing, this trend may be affected if political relations remain strained.\n\nChina maintains historical grievances over the Sino-Japanese war that took place between 1937 and 1945, during which the Imperial Japanese Army is estimated to have killed at least 10 million Chinese people. Some Chinese sources indicate that Japanese textbooks do not adequately address these historical events and that visits by Japanese leaders to the Yasukuni war shrine, which honors 2.5 million individuals who died during Japan's wars, including many from the war with China, have been a point of contention. Chinese officials have not scheduled formal summit meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and have opposed Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. Anti-Japanese demonstrations took place in China during the spring of 2005, with thousands participating.\n\nIizuka's interest in China began in high school with her study of the Chinese language. She appreciated China's ethnic diversity, historical depth, and the potential benefits of this knowledge for her career. While earning a degree in law and politics at a Tokyo university, she spent a year at Fudan University in 2003. A South Korean friend introduced her to Chen Li, and they exchanged contact information. Chen Li, who grew up close to Shanghai, had long harbored negative feelings towards Japan due to exposure to nationalistic education and participation in anti-Japanese protests during her youth. She currently avoids purchasing Japanese goods, having chosen a South Korean digital camera two years ago. Chen Li perceives buying Japanese products as conflicting with her belief that the Japanese have a history of conflict with China.\n\nDuring a campus encounter following a winter break, Chen Li observed that Iizuka appeared different from other Japanese students, noting her more casual appearance and approachable demeanor. They discovered commonalities, such as their shared appreciation for the late Hong Kong movie star Leslie Cheung. Iizuka introduced Chen Li to Japanese cuisine, including miso soup, which Chen Li found to be an acquired taste. Iizuka later shared her first-hand experiences with Chen Li, which contributed to the latter's questioning of information previously obtained through textbooks, media, and family stories. Iizuka also participated in discussions about Japan's historical actions, including the visits by Koizumi to the Yasukuni Shrine. Koizumi stated that these visits were to pray for the souls of soldiers and not to honor war criminals. However, Chen Li felt that the prime minister's presence at the shrine represented the stance of the Japanese government.\n\nChen Li participated in an anti-Japanese demonstration in China during a period of heightened sentiment. Iizuka expressed disappointment at her friend's involvement, hoping Chinese citizens would not generalize past actions to the current generation of Japanese people. Despite these differing opinions, Iizuka and Chen Li have maintained a close relationship. Last fall, Iizuka visited Shanghai and shared a lunch with Chen Li at a rooftop restaurant, engaging in friendly conversation and reflecting on their previous discussions. Iizuka is set to begin a job as a wire-service reporter and aspires to work in China. Chen Li notes that their conversations have influenced her perspective, differentiating her views on Japan from general hostility towards the country."

        "title": "Three Gorges Dam risk to environment, says China",
        "original_text": "China's showcase hydro-engineering project, the Three Gorges Dam, could become an environmental catastrophe unless remedial action is taken, the state media reported yesterday. In an unusually blunt public assessment, officials warned that landslides and pollution were among the \"hidden dangers\" facing the world's biggest hydro-electric plant. The alarmist reports, carried by the Xinhua news agency and the People's Daily website, were in stark contrast to the congratulatory tone of most previous domestic coverage of the project, which was planned for flood control along the Yangtze and for lessening China's dependence on power driven by coal. When the last of 16m tonnes of concrete was poured into the vast barrier a year ago the project was hailed as a triumph of Chinese engineering. But the problems caused by the 1.4-mile long blockage are becoming increasingly clear. \"There are many new and old hidden ecological and environmental dangers concerning the Three Gorges Dam,\" the Xinhua report quoted officials as saying. \"If preventive measures are not taken the project could lead to a catastrophe.\" Upstream water quality has deteriorated because the flow is now too slow to flush pollution out of the river system. Li Chunming, the vice-governor of Hubei, reportedly said that tributaries were being affected by more frequent outbreaks of algae. According to Xinhua, the rising volume of water in the reservoir behind the dam has eroded river banks along 91 stretches of the Yangtze, triggering landslides. The sudden collapses of tranches of soil into the water has created waves that have been up to 50 metres (164ft) high, the agency said. \"Regular geological disasters are a severe threat to the lives of residents around the dam,\" Huang Xuebin, an engineer, told a meeting of officials. In recent years the government has closed or moved 1,500 factories, built more than 70 waste treatment plants and spent 12 billion yuan (about £800m) on efforts to stabilise the transformed geology of the area. But the latest reports suggest these steps are insufficient. The Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, raised these issues in the state council this year. His senior advisers have warned that the problems are as yet far from solved. \"We cannot lower our guard against ecological and environmental problems caused by the Three Gorges project,\" Wang Xiaofeng, director in charge of building the dam, was quoted as saying. \"We cannot win by achieving economic prosperity at the cost of the environment.\"",
        "debiased_text": "State media in China reported that the Three Gorges Dam, a major hydro-engineering project, may face environmental challenges unless corrective actions are taken. Officials highlighted potential issues such as landslides and pollution as concerns related to the dam's operation. These reports, disseminated through Xinhua news agency and the People's Daily website, differ from the previously celebratory coverage of the project, which was primarily aimed at flood control on the Yangtze River and reducing reliance on coal-based power. The dam's construction was officially completed after the final placement of 16 million tonnes of concrete one year ago, and was recognized as a significant achievement in Chinese engineering. Reports indicate that water quality upstream has worsened, as reduced flow rates are not effectively removing pollution from the river system. Li Chunming, the vice-governor of Hubei, noted that more frequent algal blooms are affecting tributaries. Xinhua also stated that the increasing water levels in the dam's reservoir have led to erosion of riverbanks across 91 sections of the Yangtze, resulting in landslides. Huang Xuebin, an engineer, mentioned at a meeting with officials that these geological events pose a threat to the safety of nearby residents. In recent years, the government has taken actions including closing or relocating 1,500 factories, constructing over 70 waste treatment plants, and investing 12 billion yuan (approximately £800m) to stabilize the area's altered geology. However, emerging reports suggest these measures may not be entirely effective. The Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, addressed these issues at a state council meeting earlier this year. Senior advisors have cautioned that the problems are not yet resolved. Wang Xiaofeng, the director overseeing the dam's construction, emphasized the importance of not neglecting environmental concerns for the sake of economic gains."

        "original_text": "SHANGHAI -- China's postal authority aims to launch an insurance business, the latest sign of Beijing's efforts to develop a rural financial industry through the vast postal network that is the main bank for millions of Chinese people. The official Xinhua news agency reported that the China Insurance Regulatory Commission is considering an application to launch an insurance venture by China Postal Group. The report said China Postal Group would operate on its own, suggesting it could pose competition to a joint venture the postal group already operates with Paris-based CNP Assurances SA. In China's countryside, where as much as 70% of China's population lives, the deposit-taking and money-transfer functions of the 37,000 post offices have long been as important as mail delivery. A push to offer more financial services in rural areas reflects Beijing's broader effort to raise incomes in the countryside. Last month, the post office's deposit-taking arm was split from its mail-services operations into the China Postal Savings Bank. That established the country's fifth-biggest bank by number of outlets, although in practice there has been little sign of change for the 270 million depositors. The bank is considered relatively sound, as it hasn't traditionally offered commercial loans, although it has funneled unspecified amounts into government projects. Other moves to strengthen the rural financial system include government efforts to restructure state-run Agricultural Bank of China, which has been weakened by a legacy of bad farm-finance loans. Beijing also has taken steps to modernize a network of banking institutions called rural credit cooperatives, as well as to introduce microfinance. The government also encourages foreign firms to help serve rural customers. Reports in Xinhua and other state media said the postal group aims to sell various types of low-cost, limited-protection insurance, including life and property coverage. A spokesman declined to comment. China's insurance sector generated about $73 billion in premiums last year, up 14% from the previous year but still equivalent to about 2% of the nation's gross domestic product. In the U.S., insurance premiums in 2005 were equivalent to over 9% of GDP, according to Swiss Reinsurance Co. It isn't clear what impact the postal-insurance plan might have on the existing relationship China's postal group has with CNP, an insurance company that specializes in selling through post offices. CNP distributes insurance through 20,000 postal outlets and savings banks in France and began selling in China last year through the joint venture. CNP officials didn't respond to requests for comment. The Xinhua report suggested the business has already gained traction, noting that 14% of China's insurance agents operate through the postal system.",

        "original_text": "Schools struggling to keep up with demand for Mandarin lessons are turning to the Chinese government to help find enough staff capable of teaching the language. Officials hope that at least 100 teachers from China will be working in schools in England by September next year. Sir Cyril Taylor, the chairman of the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust, said his organisation was working with the Chinese government on a plan that will see each teacher remaining in the UK for up to two years. Sir Cyril said Mandarin was a \"strategic language\" for the UK and had to be encouraged in schools. Chinese is already enjoying a boom in UK schools and the recent government review of school languages by Lord Dearing called for Mandarin and Urdu to be introduced further. But there are fears that schools will struggle to find enough teachers able to meet the demand. Han Ban, the Office of Chinese Language Council International, is helping to identify possible candidates and will help fund some of the cost of the placement. They will also receive training in the UK to ensure that they are capable of teaching in English schools. Sir Cyril, speaking yesterday after giving evidence to the Commons education and skills select committee, said more needed to be done to make Mandarin available in schools. \"We managed to change the rules for language colleges. It used to be, because there is some national policy, that primarily European languages were taught. But now we have got that chan-ged they can teach Mandarin, Arabic or anything.\" He did not think it should be made compulsory, however. \"No, it has to be optional but the universities are desperate (for more people who can speak Mandarin). Cambridge University Sino- studies department will basically accept any good applicant that studies Mandarin.\" The programme is expected to start with five \"hub schools\" that will each have two Chinese teaching assistants who will also be used to work in other local schools. Initially, five hub schools have been identified and these schools will have two Chinese teaching assistants each and they will also be used to work in other local schools Currently about 400 schools offer Mandarin at some level. Specialist language colleges are helping with the push and are encouraging schools to share best practice. The programme has also received backing from HSBC. A schools' survey last year by the National Centre for Languages found that out of the 1,500 secondary schools that responded, 38 - about 2.5 per cent - were teaching Chinese to pupils aged 14 to 16. Part of the pressure for schools to offer these courses has come from employers who are more interested in Mandarin, Spanish and Arabic than the traditional subjects of French and German.",

        "original_text": "BEIJING -- The launch of China's foreign-exchange investment company caps months of intensive planning and widespread anticipation. Now comes the hard part: deploying nearly $200 billion in a way that earns robust returns, satisfies domestic political leaders and avoids exacerbating anxiety abroad about the intentions of the fund. China Investment Corp., established Saturday at a ceremony in Beijing, is tasked with making more-aggressive investments with a $200 billion chunk of China's roughly $1.4 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves -- the world's largest such stockpile. The launch creates one of the world's biggest sovereign-wealth funds, state-backed institutions that are playing a growing role in global capital markets. And it presents a potential boon to big global money managers, which the new company is expected to hire to help it invest -- although much of the $200 billion will be used to acquire the government's stakes in Chinese banks. The company, known as CIC, will face high -- and sometimes conflicting -- expectations from China's leadership and public at a time when global financial markets are wobbly because of weakness in the U.S. economy. Already, CIC's sole investment to date -- a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP acquired in May by CIC's planners -- has lost nearly a sixth of its value, fueling some public criticism in China. And CIC will need to contend with anxiety of some foreign politicians that the fund could be used by China to gobble up strategic assets overseas. Officials at Saturday's ceremony said the launch marked progress for China's financial reforms and reaffirmed that CIC's aims are financial. \"The purpose is to realize a maximization of long-term investment returns within an acceptable risk range,\" said Lou Jiwei, a former vice minister of finance who is the company's chairman. Much of CIC's initial funds are already spoken for -- though analysts expect it to be given more of China's reserves if it succeeds. Mr. Lou confirmed Saturday that CIC will acquire Central Huijin Investment Co., an agency that controls the government's stakes in China's biggest banks. That purchase is expected to use $67 billion. And CIC also will be used for capital injections into other government financial institutions. China's reserves have more than doubled in the past 2&frac12; years, thanks to a mushrooming trade surplus. Because Beijing tightly controls the value of its currency, the central bank must buy U.S. dollars earned by exporters. But so far the money has been parked in low-yielding assets like U.S. Treasurys. Major officials pushed for farming out much of CIC's available funds to professional investors, much like university endowment funds do, according to people involved. But other officials have argued that some funds should be used for more strategic purposes, like investing alongside China's big state-owned enterprises when they make overseas acquisitions. CIC's pursuit of more-lucrative investment channels is expected to diminish China's demand for U.S. government debt, though given the growth of China's reserves, its Treasury purchases are certain to continue. Senior Chinese officials have pledged that their new investment strategy wouldn't hurt the value of U.S. dollar assets. Mr. Lou and other planners pushed for CIC to be created as a corporation, in the hopes that structure would give it more independence than government agencies. But he will likely continue to contend with differing agendas from across the bureaucracy. CIC's 11- member board includes representatives from half a dozen agencies, including the finance ministry, the central bank, the commerce ministry, and National Development and Reform Commission, China's powerful economic-planning agency. In addition to Mr. Lou, CIC's top management includes Gao Xiqing, CIC's vice chairman and president, a veteran financial official who earned a law degree from Duke University before returning to China in the late 1980s to help establish the country's stock markets. --- Rick Carew and Andrew Batson contributed to this article.

A portion of the $200 billion will be used to acquire government stakes in Chinese banks. The company, named China Investment Corp. (CIC), will have to meet expectations from Chinese leadership and the public at a time when global financial markets are experiencing instability due to the U.S. economy's performance. CIC's first investment, a $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group LP acquired in May, has reportedly lost about one-sixth of its value, which has led to some public discussion in China. There are also concerns among foreign politicians that the fund may be used to acquire overseas strategic assets. During the launch ceremony, officials emphasized that the initiative reflects progress in China's financial reforms and that CIC's primary goal is to achieve high long-term investment returns within acceptable risk parameters. Lou Jiwei, a former vice minister of finance and CIC's chairman, stated that the objective was to maximize long-term investment returns within an acceptable risk range. The initial allocation of CIC's funds has already been outlined, with the acquisition of Central Huijin Investment Co., which manages the government's stakes in major Chinese banks, expected to consume $67 billion. CIC will also be involved in capital injections into other government-controlled financial institutions. Over the past two and a half years, China's reserves have grown significantly due to an expanding trade surplus. As the central bank manages the value of the Chinese currency, it has been purchasing U.S. dollars from exporters, which are currently invested in low-yield assets such as U.S. Treasurys. Some officials have advocated for allocating part of CIC's funds to professional investors in a manner similar to university endowment funds. Others have suggested using the funds for strategic purposes, such as supporting the overseas acquisitions of large state-owned enterprises. CIC's focus on more profitable investment opportunities is anticipated to reduce its demand for U.S. government debt. However, given the size and growth of China's reserves, continued purchases of Treasurys are expected. Chinese officials have assured that their new investment strategy will not devalue U.S. dollar assets. CIC was structured as a corporation to enhance its independence compared to government agencies. Lou Jiwei and other planners aimed for this structure to provide the company with more autonomy. The CIC board consists of 11 members, including representatives from several government agencies, such as the finance ministry, central bank, commerce ministry, and the National Development and Reform Commission, China's main economic planning body. In addition to Lou Jiwei, CIC's senior management includes Gao Xiqing, who serves as vice chairman and president, a financial official with a law degree from Duke University who contributed to the establishment of China's stock markets in the late 1980s."

        "original_text": "HONG KONG -- A pair of protests, at a factory in southern China and at the Asia headquarters of Walt Disney Co., highlight the labor challenges companies can face when their products are made under license in China. Last week, a Shenzhen factory that labor activists had accused of underpaying and mistreating employees who made Disney souvenirs lost most of its business and shut down. When the factory, Huang Xing Light Manufacturing, laid off its workers, hundreds of them protested, according to former employees and a man at the shuttered factory who identified himself as a security officer. Yesterday, members of the activist group Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior, or Sacom, which in September had cited ventilation and payment problems at Huang Xing, brought the protest to Disney's Hong Kong offices. \"Disney withdrew orders from Huang Xing as a direct result of pressure on Disney to enforce workers' rights at Huang Xing. Cutting and running is the worst response to workers' rights violations,\" the group's coordinator, Jenny Chan, said in a statement. Disney denies that it is responsible for canceling the orders after the factory was accused of exploiting workers. \"Disney has been working with both the licensee and factory for many months. To the contrary, notwithstanding multiple offers by Disney to help the licensee and factory to improve standards, the licensee has chosen to walk away,\" said Alannah Goss, Disney's Asia regional corporate-communications director, in a statement. At issue is the relationship between Disney, one of its licensees and the factory that licensee had hired in China. When one company licenses out its designs to another -- a common practice in China -- corporations and activists can disagree over who is ultimately responsible for the relationship with subcontracted factories and with the workers who make the goods. Disney, of Burbank, Calif., declined to name the licensee that pulled its business away from Huang Xing. It identified it only as a Japanese company that had been making keychains for Tokyo Disneyland. Disney said it enforces a labor-standards code of conduct that \"includes social-compliance audits of the independently run factories that produce Disney-branded merchandise for our vendors and licensees.\" Ms. Chan of Sacom said that \"Disney now just wants to shift the attention onto the licensee and the factory.\" She said Disney should have paid attention earlier to standards at the factory and should have given the factory more time for making improvements. Chen Bing, manager of Nonggang District Security Co., said Nonggang had been hired to secure the closed factory. He said that the dismissed workers have been compensated. The shuttered factory is \"under management of the local government and might reopen after Chinese New Year [after Feb. 24] with some new business,\" Mr. Chen said. --- Juying Qin contributed to this article.",
        "debiased_text": "HONG KONG -- Two protests occurred recently, one at a factory in southern China and another at the Asia headquarters of Walt Disney Co., illustrating labor-related issues that companies may encounter when their products are manufactured under license in China. Last week, a factory in Shenzhen, known as Huang Xing Light Manufacturing, faced significant loss of business and subsequently closed. The factory had been accused by labor activists of underpaying and mistreating employees involved in producing Disney souvenirs. Following the factory's decision to lay off its workers, hundreds of them gathered in protest, as reported by former employees and a security officer present at the site. Activists from the group Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior (Sacom), who previously raised concerns about ventilation and payment issues at the factory, later brought the protest to Disney's Hong Kong offices. Jenny Chan, a coordinator at Sacom, stated in a statement that Disney withdrew orders from Huang Xing as a response to pressure regarding workers' rights enforcement. She argued that the company's decision to disengage from the situation was an inappropriate reaction to alleged labor violations. Disney denied being responsible for the cancellation of orders following the accusations against the factory. Alannah Goss, Disney's Asia regional corporate-communications director, said in a statement that Disney had been collaborating with the licensee and factory for several months. She noted that Disney had made multiple offers to support the licensee and factory in improving working conditions, but the licensee opted to withdraw its business. The situation revolves around the relationship between Disney, one of its licensees, and the factory the licensee had engaged in China. When a company licenses its designs to another, as is common in China, differing perspectives may emerge regarding responsibility for the treatment of workers in subcontracted factories. Disney, based in Burbank, Calif., did not identify the licensee that removed its business from Huang Xing, only describing it as a Japanese company that had previously produced keychains for Tokyo Disneyland. The company emphasized that it enforces a labor-standards code of conduct, which includes conducting social-compliance audits for independently operated factories producing Disney-branded merchandise for vendors and licensees. Jenny Chan from Sacom indicated that Disney appears to be shifting the focus to the licensee and the factory. She suggested that Disney should have acted more promptly to address labor conditions at the factory and provided additional time for necessary improvements. Chen Bing, manager of Nonggang District Security Co., stated that Nonggang had been contracted to manage the closed factory. He confirmed that the dismissed workers have received compensation. The factory is currently under the management of the local government and may resume operations after Chinese New Year, which concludes on February 24, with potential new business."

        "original_text": "China has launched its first navigation satellite in nearly four years, taking a step forward in its drive to develop a positioning system intended eventually to rival Washington's GPS and Europe's Galileo. The successful launch early on Saturday of the Beidou navigation satellite on board a Long March 3A rocket underscores Beijing's determination to develop its space industry for bothcivilian and military applications. It comes just weeks after China prompted expressions of concern from the US by destroying one of its own ageing meteorological satellites with a missile-launched \"kinetic kill vehicle\". China's plans for its satellite navigation system, also known in English as Compass, have been shrouded in secrecy, with officials repeatedly declining to comment on their intentions. However, the launch appears to be an effort to augment a relatively imprecise existing system based on three Beidou satellites launched into geostationary orbit between 2000 and 2003. In a rare public discussion of Beijing's plans, the official Xinhua news agency said in November that two geo-stationary satellites would be launched early this year, allowing the system to cover all of China and parts of neighbouring countries by next year. The Beidou system would then be expanded to offer global coverage with the creation of a constellation of 30 medium Earth orbit satellites, Xinhua said then. The agency gave no details of timing for this part of the system, which would be similar to the Global Positioning System built by the US and Europe's Galileo satellite network. More precise positioning would be an important asset for China's armed forces, the main user of the existing Beidou network. Some analysts have suggested the expanded Beidou system will use the same radio frequencies as Galileo and possibly GPS, making it more difficult for adversaries to jam the network in case of war. Beidou's development could also pose a challenge to the commercial success of Galileo, which is already beset by rising costs. While China is a partner of the Galileo project and the government and companies are investing Euros 200m (Dollars 259m, Pounds 132m) with related facilities and research into commercial applications, it is shaping up as a potential competitor. The Chinese embassy in Brussels said it was committed to the project to improve political ties, learn from European know-how and provide greater competition. Xinhua said in November that Beijing would provide open access to Beidou signals allowing positioning accuracy within 10 metres - and more precise location for \"authorised\" users. Full operation of the Euros 3bn-plus Galileo, which will also have 30 satellites, has been postponed until 2011 because of technical problems and delays in setting up the public-private partnership needed to build it. It promises to be accurate to a metre and the EU and US reiterated this month it would be \"compatible and interoperable\" with GPS, with a new generation of receivers able to benefit from both. China has already begun commercialising the existing Beidou system, although its appeal is limited by its lack of accuracy and the large size of the positioning devices it uses. In one potentially large-scale application, Beidou devices are being installed on Chinese deep-sea fishing boats to help them navigate. Beidou offers an alternative distress signal system and can help authorities monitor boat movements. Additional reporting byAndrew Bounds in Brussels",

        "original_text": "The craze for Chinese listings has inspired a pioneering fund that will automatically liquidate hot new stocks within months of their purchase and reinvest the proceeds in yet more initial public offerings. Macquarie's IPO China Concentrated Core Fund will employ a \"rotational strategy\" to invest in Chinese companies' debuts in Hong Kong, Singapore, the US and other overseas markets. The fund will operate through a \"rules-based process\" under which it will sell its longest-held positions to free capital for forthcoming flotations that meet the fund's criteria. The fund - unveiled in Hong Kong yesterday and due to commence in March - comes on the heels of a blistering year for China issues, during which Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country's biggest bank, and Bank of China raised a combined Dollars 28bn (Pounds 14.1bn) on the Hong Kong stock exchange and another Dollars 8bn in Shanghai. ICBC's offering, the world's biggest, attracted global subscription orders in excess of Dollars 500bn. With such competition for ICBC and other China-related offerings, investors frequently receive only a fraction of the shares they subscribe for. \"We put (this product) together to fill a gap in the market,\" said Nick Thompson, head of non-flow structured products sales at Macquarie Equities (Asia). \"People are going for IPOs but (their allocations) are being scaled back.\" Mr Thompson added that the fund would offer \"one-day\" punters the opportunity to invest on a longer-term basis. Citing Bloomberg data for the first half of 2006, Macquarie noted that China-related listings in Hong Kong, Singapore and the US paid an average return of more than 25 per cent on the first day of trading and almost 50 per cent in the first week. But investors who held shares for three months did best, realising an average return of about 90 per cent. The length of time the fund holds the China stocks it acquires will depend on the number of newer issues in which it needs to invest. The stronger the pipeline, the more positions it will liquidate to invest in fresh offerings. \"This strategy means investors now have a vehicle that can capture the longer-term growth in China's newly listed companies and offers them a disciplined approach to IPO investing,\" said Sonia Cheung, head of flow structured product sales for Macquarie Equities.",

The fund will follow a rules-based process to sell its longest-held positions in order to allocate capital to new IPOs that meet its investment criteria. The fund was announced in Hong Kong and is scheduled to begin operations in March. This follows a busy period for Chinese company listings, with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Bank of China raising a combined USD 28 billion on the Hong Kong stock exchange and an additional USD 8 billion in Shanghai. ICBC's IPO, the largest globally, attracted over USD 500 billion in global subscription orders. Due to high demand for China-related IPOs, investors often receive only a portion of the shares they apply for. Nick Thompson, head of non-flow structured products sales at Macquarie Equities (Asia), stated that the fund was created to address a market need, as many investors are interested in IPOs but face limited allocations. He mentioned that the fund would allow short-term investors the opportunity to participate in a longer-term investment strategy. According to Bloomberg data for the first half of 2006, China-related IPOs in Hong Kong, Singapore, and the US achieved average returns of over 25 percent on their first day of trading and nearly 50 percent in the first week. Investors who held shares for three months achieved an average return of approximately 90 percent. The duration for which the fund will hold its investments will depend on the availability of new IPOs.

        "original_text": "Japan’s military today emerged from decades in the political shadows when it was given full ministerial status as part of Tokyo’s recent moves towards a more aggressive international presence. The move will give the ministry direct access to a budget - which until now has come through the cabinet office - and make it easier for Japanese troops to take part in overseas peacekeeping missions. It is the latest in a series of reforms Mr Abe hopes will end decades of Japanese timidity on the diplomatic stage, following his troops’ relatively trouble-free humanitarian mission in Iraq and amid growing concern over North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme. Mr Abe is due to meet Tony Blair in London later today at the start of a European tour designed to shore up support for Tokyo’s hard line against North Korea and to forge closer ties with Nato. “I would like to show them Japan’s will to actively contribute to the world,” Mr Abe told reporters in Tokyo, adding that he would explain to European leaders the “direction I am leading Japan and what kind of beautiful nation I am trying to build”. He is also expected to seek European support for Japan’s attempts to settle the cold war abductions of its citizens by North Korean spies and Tokyo’s stalled push for a permanent seat on the UN security council, a move opposed by China. The defence ministry’s new status was marked by a parade in Tokyo attended by foreign military officials and members of Japan’s self-defence forces in full regalia. Fumio Kyuma, who became Japan’s first defence minister since the war, sought to reassure those who still harbour doubts about giving the military greater prestige more than 60 years after the war. The new ministry, he said, needed to “transform itself both in name and as a policy-making body so that it can meet the expectations and earn the trust of the people”. Mr Abe said: “I’m truly proud today on this occasion as the prime minister to have inaugurated a defence ministry, an organization with the responsibility for defence that is a nation’s inalienable sovereign right. “This is a big first step towards building a new nation after emerging from the postwar regime.” China, however, said the change was proof that Japan wanted to abandon the pacifism it embraced after the war. “On the surface it is only a slight change in words,” the official Xinhua news agency said. “The difference in essence is fundamental. The moves provide sufficient reason for people to worry if Japan is able to stick to the pacifist path and to truly reflect on history.” Last month Mr Abe’s government pushed through controversial changes to the postwar education law to require children to be taught patriotism as part of the national curriculum. He has also vowed to revise Japan’s postwar constitution to enable troops to play a bigger role overseas, including coming to the aid of an ally under attack.",

        "original_text": "China has pulled out of a meeting to discuss new sanctions on Iran, European diplomats said yesterday, highlighting the obstacles western powers face in their quest to increase pressure on Tehran over its nuclear programme. The US had wanted to agree a set of prospective measures by the end of this month, which could be quickly taken to the United Nations Security Council if Iran failed to comply with UN demands to rein in its nuclear programme. But China's decision not to participate in the scheduled meeting next week of political directors from the Security Council's five permanent members, plus Germany, means that no such agreement is likely to be in place by that time. The meeting is now unlikely to take place next week. \"It's pretty well understood why the Chinese have postponed,\" said a British official. \"It was a mixture of genuine diary difficulties coupled with the track record of resistance on their part to moving swiftly towards an outcome.\" This comes despite an agreement among the big powers in September to \"finalise a text\" on new sanctions and bring it to a vote at the Security Council, unless two international reports assessed that Iran had made progress on complying with UN demands. The first of those reports, by Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said this week Iran had provided new information about the nuclear programme's past, but the agency's current information about the programme was \"diminishing\". The second report, by Javier Solana, EU foreign policy chief, is due this month. \"If both reports show that there is no progress or political outcome then we are going for a further resolution,\" said a French official. \"We prefer action at the UN but we are also ready to pursue measures at the European Union.\" Germany also described Mr ElBaradei's report as \"on the whole . . . not encouraging\". However, China and Russia have consistently been reluctant to impose additional sanctions on Tehran, and have instead encouraged Mr ElBaradei in his efforts to broker a deal with Iran on disclosing more about its nuclear past. Yesterday, some diplomats said that without further progress, the US and the EU could seek to take a new resolution to the Security Council before securing the backing of Moscow and Beijing - a high risk approach. Britain and France also face difficulties in persuading the EU to agree sanctions, because of reservations among Germany, Spain and Italy about proceeding with unilateral steps that go beyond UN sanctions.",
        "debiased_text": "China has decided not to attend a meeting aimed at discussing potential new sanctions against Iran, according to European diplomats. This decision underscores the challenges that Western nations encounter in their efforts to exert increased pressure on Iran regarding its nuclear program.

Germany also characterized Mr. ElBaradei's report as 'on the whole . . . not encouraging'. China and Russia have regularly expressed reservations about implementing further sanctions against Iran and have supported Mr. ElBaradei's efforts to negotiate with Iran for more transparency about its nuclear activities. Some diplomats expressed that without further progress, the United States and the European Union may proceed to present a new resolution to the Security Council before obtaining support from Moscow and Beijing, though this approach is considered high risk. Britain and France also encounter challenges in persuading the European Union to agree on sanctions, as Germany, Spain, and Italy have reservations about taking unilateral actions that surpass existing UN sanctions."

        "original_text": "Floods, storms, hurricanes and tornados - only the most virulent deniers of global warming and its effects refuse to accept climate change and its effects. But a growing number of investors see new weather patterns and their results as opportunities, as well as problems. Fund managers are rushing to set up \"climate change\" funds. Allianz, F&amp;C, HSBC, Jupiter and Schroders are leading the field with new or planned funds and HSBC calls climate change \"one of the biggest investment themes for the foreseeable future\". So far, these have attracted tiny amounts - under £100m - but there are hopes of increasing interest which will lead other fund managers to join in if the cash inflow becomes a reality. The trick managers hope to pull off is spotting firms well placed to respond to a changing climate and its effects on the wider economy. \"Global warming will have a huge impact on everything, including transport, property, agriculture and insurance,\" says Simon Webber, joint manager of Schroders Global Climate Change fund. \"We look for companies that either mitigate climate change or help others adapt to it. We have identified 600 worldwide but our fund only invests in around 75.\" Strictly speaking, the Schroders fund is not an ethical or \"green\" fund. While it can invest in clean wind or wave energy, it can also buy shares in the nuclear power industry. It hopes to appeal both to investors who believe climate change is a huge threat and those who simply believe this is the way the stock market is heading. It holds shares in insurer Munich Re, which has a 30-strong team researching how insurers should react to the new environment. HSBC's Climate Change fund was launched earlier this month. It has also set up a \"Climate Change Centre of Excellence,\" to analyse some off the key issues. Run by Nick Robins, formerly a fund manager specialising in socially responsible investment, it seeks \"to act as a catalyst for greater understanding of the scientific, regulatory and economic dimensions of climate change\". Mr Robins says: \"The bank looked at its own carbon footprint and achieved neutrality in 2005. Last year, we initiated a carbon finance strategy looking at how climate change impacted on lending decisions and corporate operations. From there, HSBC moved to setting up the new centre which will research how the bank can go beyond carbon neutrality to full sustainability.\" HSBC's new fund is managed by Farley Thomas, who sees climate change as all-encompassing. \"It's a structural factor that will have far more impact than the internet. It affects basics such as agriculture, housing and the food versus fuel debate in the biofuel arena. It's not just a future threat - it's here now, and how firms react to it will determine the course of future earnings,\" Mr Thomas says. \"We have set up an investable climate change index of around 300 diversified companies that derive more than 50% of total revenues from climate-change related activities.\" Mr Thomas says that if an investor had been able to buy into the index in January 2004, he or she would have enjoyed a return of 125%. The MSCI World index advanced 55% over the same period. Mr Thomas says investors must forget geographical boundaries as climate change and methods of dealing with it are global: \"Demand for low-cost items in China can lead to demand for wind turbines from Denmark. But we are disproportionately invested in emerging markets because it is countries like India and China that can be both the problem and the solution.\" The F&amp;C Global Opportunities fund is unashamedly \"non-ethical\". \"There is no negative screening out of companies. We can invest how we want in companies which harness the opportunities from climate change. This is much broader than an alternative energy fund. The fund will look at the consequences of climate change, how these are confronted at the highest levels of government, and the subsequent policy changes that result,\" says Vicki Bakhshi, a climate change expert and former senior researcher on the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, who is part of F&amp;C's 15-strong governance and sustainability team advising the fund. The Allianz Global Eco Trends fund will target companies involved in alternative energy, pollution control and clean water. \"Extreme weather conditions and climate change are becoming more prevalent. This is leading to a new industrial revolution as companies are having to respond,\" says fund manager Bozena Jankowska.",

Several major financial institutions, including Allianz, F&amp;C, HSBC, Jupiter and Schroders, are either establishing or planning to establish funds focused on climate change. HSBC has referred to climate change as one of the biggest investment themes for the foreseeable future. Presently, these funds have attracted relatively small amounts of capital, under £100 million. However, there is optimism that increased interest may encourage more fund managers to enter this space. The objective of these managers is to identify companies that are well positioned to respond to the changes in climate and their economic implications. Simon Webber, a joint manager of the Schroders Global Climate Change fund, explains that the fund invests in companies that either reduce the impact of climate change or assist others in adapting. The fund has identified 600 companies globally but invests in approximately 75 of them. The Schroders fund is not classified as an ethical or 'green' fund.

He mentions that an investor who had been able to invest in a climate change index in January 2004 would have seen a 125% return, compared to a 55% return on the MSCI World index during the same period. Thomas argues that investors should consider climate change as a global issue and that emerging markets, such as India and China, play a significant role both in the challenges and opportunities associated with climate change. The F&amp;C Global Opportunities fund is described as non-ethical, as it does not exclude any companies based on negative criteria. It is designed to invest in companies that can benefit from climate change-related opportunities. The fund examines the consequences of climate change, governmental responses and the resulting policy changes. Vicki Bakhshi, a climate change expert and former senior researcher on the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, is part of the 15-member governance and sustainability team advising the fund. The Allianz Global Eco Trends fund will focus on companies engaged in alternative energy, pollution control and clean water initiatives. Bozena Jankowska, a fund manager, indicates that extreme weather events and climate change are becoming more frequent, prompting a new industrial revolution as companies adapt to these changes."

        "original_text": "CNOOC, the Chinese state-owned oil company, yesterday defended China's drive to secure oil in Africa against criticism it was being too aggressive. Fu Chengyu, chairman and chief executive, insisted his company was taking just the same risks as other international oil groups. \"There were a lot of comments in the international media saying we were taking greater risks than other oil firms. I think that is wrong,\" Mr Fu said at CNOOC's results briefing in Hong Kong. He said other oil groups were already investing in the countries that Chinese companies, such as CNOOC, were moving into. CNOOC struck the biggest deal in Africa last year when it and South Atlantic Petroleum paid Dollars 2.7bn for a 45 per cent stake in Nigeria's Akpo field. Last month, the Financial Times revealed that CNOOC signed a production-sharing deal with Somalia, which has been a failed state for more than a decade. The company expects the deepwater Akpo field to begin production by late next year, and to have a peak output of 175,000barrels of oil equivalent a day. \"Speaking specifically for Nigeria, quite a few other companies have invested there,\" said Mr Fu. \"We are confident that the investments we made will have excellent returns.\" The company is expecting its output this year to be flat compared with last year, at about 162m-170m barrels, but Mr Fu hinted that output would improve. CNOOC's Liuhua field, which stopped production after it was damaged by a typhoon last year, resumed production well ahead of schedule in June. The South China Sea field, which accounts for 5 per cent of the company'soutput, was not accounted for in its production projections. First-half profits for the company fell 10 per cent to Rmb14.55bn (Dollars 1.93bn) on lower oil prices, and CNOOC shares fell 4 per cent to close at HKDollars 8.87 (Dollars 1.14). Mr Fu confirmed that CNOOC's plans to list in mainland China's domestic A-share market have been delayed. Hong Kong-listed CNOOC belongs to a class of \"red-chip\" companies that primarily do business in mainland China but are barred from listing in the mainland because their shares are already listed elsewhere. A plan to bring such red chips back to the Chinese stock market has long been rumoured but no timetable has been set. Mr Fu said China's stock regulators had yet to approve any applications. There were fears such a move might damage confidence in the Hong Kong economy, he added.",

Fu Chengyu remarked that several other companies have invested in Nigeria and expressed confidence in the returns from CNOOC's investments. The company expects its production this year to remain similar to last year, between 162 million to 170 million barrels. However, Fu Chengyu suggested that production output could improve in the future. CNOOC's Liuhua field, which ceased production after being damaged by a typhoon last year, resumed operations ahead of schedule in June. The South China Sea field, contributing 5 per cent of the company's output, was not included in the production projections. In the first half of the year, the company's profits decreased by 10 per cent to 14.55 billion yuan (1.93 billion dollars) due to lower oil prices, and its shares dropped by 4 per cent to close at 8.87 Hong Kong dollars (1.14 dollars). Fu Chengyu confirmed that plans to list CNOOC on mainland China's domestic A-share market have been postponed. CNOOC, currently listed in Hong Kong, is classified as a 'red-chip' company that primarily operates in mainland China but is not permitted to list there because its shares are already listed elsewhere. There have been long-standing rumors about plans to bring such red-chip companies back to the mainland stock market; however, no schedule has been established. Fu Chengyu indicated that Chinese stock regulators have not yet approved any applications for such a listing. Concerns were raised that such a move could negatively impact confidence in the Hong Kong economy."

        "original_text": "Hank Paulson, US Treasury secretary, diplomatically played down the idea that the US was competing with China for Africa's expanding business opportunities, ahead of his whirlwind tour of Ghana yesterday to promote US investment in the continent. Asked by the Financial Times about the perception in Africa that Beijing had stolen a march on Washington in its recent dramatically expanded engagement with the continent, he went so far as to hail China's African investments. \"It's good,\" he said. \"Every part of the world needs investment. This region in particular will benefit from more investment. What I preach all the time is not win-lose, but win-win.\" His comments reflected the Bush administration's policy of distancing itself from the idea of a new scramble for Africa's resources. But his pragmatic stance was not shared by US delegates at an Africa-US business summit in Cape Town where discussion was dominated by the role of China, with many US businesspeople talking of the dangers of being left behind. While the big oil companies that dominate US investment in Africa do not see China as a serious competitor, many US delegates fretted that China was gaining not just a headstart but also an unfair advantage in Africa through its willingness to waive human rights issues in its business deals. Recently it has shown signs of expanding its interests from resources, its primary focus on the continent, to the financial sector. Robert Mosbacher, president of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, said there was \"a bit of catch-up going on\" after US companies had focused more in recent years on eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and parts of Latin America, than on Africa. \"There's no doubt the US can do more to take advantage of growth opportunities in Africa.\" But, he added, he was concerned that Chinese investment into Africa was \"not as focused on the same priorities of addressing the rule of law and enforceability of contracts and transparency as are the US and Europe\". Joseph Grandmaison, a director of the Export Import Bank of the United States, was blunter still. He was stunned, he said, that a session focusing on China \"did not discuss human rights and made no difference between us and their country. There is a difference\". But African delegates at the annual Corporate Council on Africa summit were unabashed. Mandisi Mpahlwa, South Africa's trade and industry minister, said the US was subjective in its focus on human rights and asked why the issue was not raised, for example, about US businesses investing in China. President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda was caustic about the record of western businesses. Uganda received Dollars 1 per kg of coffee it grew, he said, before the beans were roasted and ground in London and sold for Dollars 20. \"For each 1kg of coffee, we are donating Dollars 19. We have been doing this for a long time. But we are fighting it. We are going to change.\" Mr Paulson tempered his enthusiasm by cautioning of the need to be aware of \"environmental sustainability\" and also of the risks of countries taking on debts they cannot repay. Chinese companies have been accused of ignoring basic environmental standards in extracting African resources. Princeton Lyman, a former ambassador to South Africa and Nigeria and fellow at Washington's Council on Foreign Relations, said: \"There are people in the US hyping this and saying it's a strategic issue but the administration has not jumped on that bandwagon, wisely. People are fascinated and intrigued by China's involvement. It's brought people to look at Africa. A lot of people in the US are saying if China is doing this there must be something happening.\"",
        "debiased_text": "Hank Paulson, the US Treasury secretary, discussed the engagement of the United States and China with Africa's growing business opportunities ahead of his visit to Ghana. When asked about Africa's perception of China's increased involvement in the region compared to the US, Paulson acknowledged China's investments in Africa, stating that they were beneficial. He emphasized the importance of investment for global development, particularly in Africa, and promoted a win-win approach rather than a competitive one. His remarks aligned with the Bush administration's stance on avoiding the notion of a new resource competition in Africa. However, US business delegates at an Africa-US business summit in Cape Town expressed concerns about China's influence. Discussions at the summit were heavily centered on the role of China in Africa, with some suggesting the US might be at a disadvantage. While major US oil companies in Africa did not consider China a significant competitor, several delegates noted that China might have an unfair advantage in certain areas due to its less stringent focus on human rights in business dealings. Additionally, there was an observation that Chinese investment interests have been expanding from resource extraction to the financial sector. Robert Mosbacher, president of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, mentioned that the US was in a process of catching up in African investment, as companies had previously focused more on regions such as Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and parts of Latin America. He stated that there were opportunities for the US to benefit from Africa's growth but expressed concern that Chinese investments were not as focused on the rule of law, contract enforceability, and transparency as those of the US and Europe. Joseph Grandmaison, a director of the Export Import Bank of the United States, noted that a session focusing on China did not address human rights issues and pointed out that there is a distinction between the US and China in this area. At the Corporate Council on Africa summit, African delegates responded to comments about human rights, with Mandisi Mpahlwa, South Africa's trade and industry minister, noting the US's subjective focus on the issue and questioning why similar concerns were not raised about US businesses in China. President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda discussed the economic disparity in the coffee trade, stating that Uganda received a significantly lower price per kilogram of coffee compared to the final selling price in London. He noted that this longstanding issue remains a point of contention and that efforts are being made to address it. Paulson also noted the importance of considering environmental sustainability and the risks of countries incurring unsustainable debt. Chinese companies have been criticized for not adhering to environmental standards in resource extraction. Princeton Lyman, a former US ambassador to South Africa and Nigeria, and a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, mentioned that while some in the US view China's engagement with Africa as a strategic matter, the administration had not fully supported this perspective. He noted that China's involvement has generated interest in Africa, prompting many to consider why the US might not be as actively engaged."

        "original_text": "Beijing -- Chinese leader Hu Jintao embarks on his second five-year term engaged in a balancing act between his government's focus on economic growth and its promise to deliver a more equitable society and better environmental protection. In a speech yesterday to open the Communist Party's twice-a-decade National Congress, Mr. Hu, who is both the party's chief and China's president, said economic growth must remain the party's \"central task.\" That focus has a political motivation as well. Delivering increased prosperity has been the party's main method for addressing any discontent with its rule. Continuing economic growth is necessary for the \"lasting stability of the party and the nation,\" Mr. Hu said. He made clear that any political changes would be limited and that the Communist Party's monopoly on power must be maintained. Delivering an overall strategy rather than a list of new policies, Mr. Hu spent little time on shorter-term economic issues such as the direction of China's tightly controlled exchange rate or recent surges in real-estate and stock prices. China's benchmark stock-market index, the Shanghai Composite, closed yesterday at a record of 6030.08 points, up 125% so far this year. China's per-capita gross domestic product, a broad measure of the nation's prosperity, has nearly doubled during the past five years and was just more than $2,000 in 2006. Mr. Hu said the government's goal is to double that figure again by 2020 and \"basically eliminate\" absolute poverty. Analysts say government agencies will be rolling out specific policy measures in coming months, now that the leadership has reached a consensus on the priorities laid out in Mr. Hu's speech. \"From his focus, you can conclude that the economy, more than any other issue, will stand foremost in policy making in the next few years,\" said Zhao Xijun, a professor of finance at Renmin University in Beijing. While the rapid gains of recent years -- China's economy has grown by 10% or more every year since 2003 -- have made many Chinese better off, inequality is on the rise and environmental damage has been severe. \"Our growth is realized at an excessively high cost of resources and the environment,\" Mr. Hu told more than 2,000 delegates to the party congress in Beijing's Great Hall of the People. In order to maintain expansion without using as many resources, China's growth in the future will need to be driven more by improvements in technology and productivity, Mr. Hu said. He outlined a vision for a restructuring of the world's fourth- largest economy, one that would emphasize technology rather than heavy industry, services rather than manufacturing, and local consumer spending rather than exports. To ensure that more people benefit from economic growth, Mr. Hu said the government will raise minimum wages, expand health care and the social safety net and stimulate the creation of jobs in the private sector. The emphasis on the environment could mean heavier financial penalties on polluters, as well as tax incentives for energy-saving technology, Mr. Zhao said, while the stated desire to boost household incomes could lead to lower personal tax rates. Yet Mr. Hu offered no clear account of how he would resolve any conflicts between economic growth and preserving the environment and social harmony. The local officials charged with carrying out Mr. Hu's policy can be caught between the two sets of priorities. \"The central government does require us to strengthen environmental protection,\" Chen Baogen, mayor of the city of Xi'an, said in a recent interview. But the local government also needs to continue fast economic growth, Mr. Chen said. \"Speeding up development creates jobs for more people and raises their income,\" which in turn brings the local government more tax revenue, he said. Local governments need that money to provide the higher standard of social services that have been promised. \"Without money we can't pay for schools or improve health care,\" Mr. Chen said. With its leadership focused on domestic issues, China has in recent years largely avoided international entanglements and military action, and Mr. Hu said China remains committed to \"the path of peaceful development.\" Taiwan, the democratically governed island that China claims as its rightful territory, is still China's most important military and foreign-policy issue, and those relations have been under strain recently. However, Mr. Hu didn't propose a significant change in strategy. He offered to discuss a \"peace agreement\" with the island's leadership, but only on the condition that they acknowledge Taiwan is part of China, something the island's president has ruled out.",

He indicated that economic development has been a primary means for the party to address societal discontent and is critical for maintaining the 'lasting stability of the party and the nation.' Mr. Hu reiterated that political changes would be limited and that the Communist Party's exclusive control over power would be preserved.

Although China's economy has grown by 10% or more annually since 2003, benefiting many citizens, reports indicate rising inequality and significant environmental degradation. Mr. Hu stated that the current growth model carries an excessive cost in terms of resources and the environment. He proposed that future economic growth should be more reliant on technological advancements and productivity improvements rather than resource-intensive methods. Mr. Hu emphasized a restructuring of the economy to prioritize technology over heavy industry, services over manufacturing, and local consumer spending over exports. To ensure broader societal benefits from growth, the government plans to increase minimum wages, expand healthcare, strengthen the social safety net, and promote job creation in the private sector. The focus on environmental issues could lead to increased financial penalties for polluters and tax incentives for energy-efficient technologies, according to Mr. Zhao. The aim to boost household incomes might also result in lower personal tax rates. However, Mr. Hu did not provide a clear mechanism for resolving potential conflicts between economic growth and environmental preservation or social harmony. Local officials responsible for implementing these policies may face difficulty in reconciling these competing priorities. Chen Baogen, the mayor of Xi'an, stated in a recent interview that while the central government emphasizes environmental protection, local authorities also prioritize rapid economic development. He noted that development generates more jobs and increases local income levels, which in turn boost tax revenue necessary for delivering promised improvements in social services, such as education and healthcare. With its leadership primarily focused on domestic issues, China has largely steered clear of international conflicts and military engagements in recent years, maintaining a commitment to 'peaceful development.' Relations with Taiwan remain a critical aspect of China's foreign and military policy, as the island is considered part of Chinese territory. Recent developments have created tension in these relations, yet Mr. Hu did not indicate a significant shift in approach. He expressed willingness to engage in discussions about a 'peace agreement' with Taiwan's leadership, provided they recognize Taiwan as part of China, a stance that has been rejected by the island's president."

        "original_text": "The morning after China's stocks had their biggest one-day plunge in a decade and triggered a global selloff of shares, Qiu Liming lined up with a dozen others to open her first trading account at a Shanghai brokerage firm. \"I'm ready to trade stocks,\" said the 54-year-old retiree, who had to use sharp elbows to retain her spot in line. When it comes to stocks, China's investors have traditionally danced to their own tune. In recent years, they sold shares as China's economy powered skyward, while events that created global market turmoil, like the terrorist attacks on the U.S. in 2001, hardly made an impression. That disconnect was underscored yesterday as Asian markets continued to tumble -- but the Shanghai Composite Index, after shedding 8.8% Tuesday, bounced up 3.9%. Look for big hedge funds, as well, to stick with Chinese stocks despite Tuesday's plunge. Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong remain attractive to many large hedge funds, those that generally manage more than $1 billion. \"Some people are selling, but it is nowhere near across the board,\" said one hedge-fund manager. On the contrary, he said, his fund, one of the largest investing in Asia, tried to snap up Chinese shares on the Hong Kong exchange yesterday. It couldn't get orders filled because there weren't enough shares on offer from sellers, he said. Hong Kong's bellwether Hang Seng index dropped 2.5% yesterday, on the back of a decline Tuesday. While unsettled by the notion that a stumble in China's stock prices had roiled exchanges around the world, investors and analysts said the ruckus has more to do with global shareholders looking for an excuse to sell than with fundamental weakness in the markets. As markets increasingly trade based on events in the world's fourth- largest economy, from its iron-ore purchases to its plans for investing U.S. dollars, its stocks have remained in the background. Tuesday's movement may be a suggestion that is changing, in line with the emergence of China's economy itself. Many analysts say such sentiment is premature. China's stock market, they say, traditionally has had a low correlation with its economy, much less the global one. They see China as a catalyst, not a cause of the global market move. For instance, China's stock markets remain too small -- and stock investors too few -- for even a sustained fall in the indexes to have a big effect on the domestic economy and consumer spending. That is why Tuesday's selloff wasn't taken as an event that might signal, or cause, a slowdown in the economy. But the turmoil has thrown the spotlight on how important guidance from China's government remains in directing the course of an increasingly large and significant market, as expectations about policy tripped up the market this week. \"The government hasn't directly intervened in the market, just reminded investors of the risks,\" said Zuo Xiaolei, chief economist at China Galaxy Securities in Beijing. In the wake of the market's almost uninterrupted rise last year, she now expects more fluctuations, and more uncertainty, in 2007. \"This is healthy,\" Ms. Zuo said. \"It helps keep the risk of a bubble from accumulating.\" Traditionally, China's leaders have had much greater success in engineering and managing the fast growth of the economy than in getting the stock market to rise at all. Until the 130% surge last year, the Shanghai Composite Index fell for almost five years. Most Markets Keep Moving Lower for a Second Day A recovery in Shanghai stocks couldn't buoy other Asian markets or European shares, extending the selloff that rippled around the world Tuesday. The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks shares listed on the bigger of China's two stock markets, ended up at 2881.07. Big losers in Asia included Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index (down 3.7%), the benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index (down 7.9%) and India's 30-stock Sensitive Index (down 4%). The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 Index shed 1.5% yesterday, extending Tuesday's 3% drop. A positive morning of U.S. trading didn't lift European indexes out of their losses, with the German DAX index of 30 blue chips down 1.5% and the French CAC 40 index falling 1.3%. Still, market strategists and investors yesterday said the two-day downturn didn't appear to be the start of a prolonged bout of selling, with some noting that many shares ended off their intraday lows. In LONDON, the FTSE 100 index fell 1.8% to 6171.50. Banking group HBOS fell 4.6% on mixed results and was the biggest decliner in the index. Miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto also fell. In TOKYO, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies fell 2.9%, or 515.80 points, to 17604.12. The index had dropped about 700 points at one point, and only two of the benchmark index's components posted gains. In HONG KONG, shares continued their slide, with the Hang Seng Index dropping to 19651.51 after falling 1.8% on Tuesday. --- Tang Hanting in Shanghai contributed to this article.

        "debiased_text": "Following a significant one-day decline in China's stock markets, which marked the largest drop in a decade and led to a global share price selloff, Qiu Liming, a 54-year-old retiree, joined a group of individuals in line at a Shanghai brokerage firm to open her first trading account. Qiu stated her intent to begin trading stocks. Historically, Chinese investors have operated independently of global market trends. In recent years, they have purchased shares as China's economy grew and remained largely unaffected by global events such as the 2001 U.S. terrorist attacks. This divergence was evident as Asian markets continued to decline, while the Shanghai Composite Index, which fell by 8.8% on Tuesday, rose by 3.9% the following day. Large hedge funds, which typically manage over $1 billion, also indicated a continued interest in Chinese stocks despite the drop. Several hedge fund managers noted that their funds attempted to purchase shares on the Hong Kong exchange, but were unable to complete transactions due to a lack of available shares. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, a key indicator, fell by 2.5% after declining on Tuesday. Investors and analysts stated that the market reaction was more reflective of global shareholders seeking to sell than a fundamental issue within China's markets. While China's economic activity has increasingly influenced global markets, its stock prices have previously remained largely separate from these trends. However, Tuesday's selloff may indicate a shift in this pattern. Analysts suggested that the reaction was premature, as China's stock market traditionally has a weak correlation with both its domestic economy and global markets. They described China as a contributing factor rather than the primary cause of the global market movement. Some analysts noted that China's stock market is still relatively small, and its investor base is limited. Thus, even a sustained decline in the indexes would not significantly impact the domestic economy or consumer spending. The government has not directly intervened in the market, but has issued reminders about the risks involved. Zuo Xiaolei, chief economist at China Galaxy Securities in Beijing, anticipates increased fluctuations and uncertainty in 2007, following the nearly uninterrupted rise of the Shanghai Composite Index in the previous year. She characterized this as a healthy development that may help prevent the buildup of market bubbles. In contrast to the rise in Shanghai, most other markets experienced continued declines the following day. The Shanghai Composite Index ended at 2881.07. In Asia, notable declines included Singapore's Straits Times Index (down 3.7%), the Philippine Stock Exchange Index (down 7.9%), and India's Sensitive Index (down 4%). The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 Index also fell by 1.5%, extending its loss from Tuesday. A positive morning in U.S. markets did not reverse the decline in European markets, with the German DAX index down 1.5% and the French CAC 40 index falling by 1.3%. In London, the FTSE 100 index dropped 1.8% to 6171.50. HBOS, a banking group, fell 4.6% and was the largest decliner in the index.

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index continued its decline, reaching 19651.51 after a 1.8% drop on Tuesday."

        "original_text": "After years of political, social and economic chaos under Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping set a new course for China, determined to build the economy first and the military later. He sought a low-key foreign policy where China would not take the lead in world affairs and the nation would \"bide time, hide capabilities\". Almost 30 years later, China has emerged as an economic power and is slowly becoming more assertive militarily. However, broad questions remain about the Chinese military's capabilities, doctrine and intentions as it evolves into a more technically advanced force. China's military has received a technological upgrade paid for by double-digit budget increases over the past 20 years. This has enabled the People's Liberation Army to increase its access to technology, both by importing high-tech equipment and weapons platforms and by recruiting more technically adept soldiers. This represents a significant shift from a largely illiterate peasant army that practised a \"people's war\" doctrine, where generals were confident the PLA had more soldiers than the enemy had bullets. Reports of the PLA hacking into US and German government computer networks are part of this modernising trend, just as China surprised military analysts when it carried out a successful anti-satellite test in January, demonstrating a technical capacity that was previously underestimated. Most important, these activities reveal that Chinese military planners and their civilian leaders recognise that to overcome technically superior militaries, they must resort to \"asymmetric\" strategies that exploit the adversary'sweaknesses. However, the hacker attacks on a Pentagon computer system - reported in the Financial Times - and several German government networks should be kept in perspective. Based on reports that the compromised Pentagon data were unclassified, the Chinese have not demonstrated the capacity to disrupt critical military computer systems by hacking. The fact that the attackers were reputedly traced by investigators is an indication that Chinese technology has its limits as well. While the Chinese foreign ministry denied the Pentagon attack (though not the German ones), it is likely that the intrusions are part of a broader strategy to acquire information that furthers China's technical development. The Chinese military, like the commercial sector, has a poor record of innovation and is highly dependent on imported technology acquired by legal and illicit means. Until the Chinese improve their indigenous research and development capacity, there is little threat that they will surpass the west in technology. China's military modernisation strategy is based on the premise that it is dealing with a technically superior adversary. While building its capacity to confront the enemy head on, it also must exploit vulnerabilities. China's current strategy was shaped by the allied victory in the 1990 Gulf war, where US technology overwhelmed an Iraqi military equipped with Soviet-designed platforms very similar to Chinese ones. However, the present Iraq crisis has demonstrated some of the limits of US military technology and perhaps exposed some vulnerabilities in US dependence on the internet, satellites and information-centred warfare, compared with China's dependence on large numbers of troops. China has sought to reassure regional neighbours and the west that its military modernisation does not pose a threat and that it is seeking to be a responsible world power. China has recently sought to assuage concerns by touting its efforts to be more transparent. Arguably, there has been progress. China has published defence \"white papers\" and has committed to make annual reports to the United Nations on its military budget and international arms sales. However, the accuracy and reliability of China's self- reporting do not diminish the suspicion of many critics, who point out that China's revelations contain little substance. China's efforts appear part of a comprehensive propaganda effort that attempts to shape global perceptions that its rise is peaceful, as well as assure Chinese citizens that growing investments in the military are justified, despite widespread rural poverty and underfunded social services. The Chinese acknowledgement that greater transparency is necessary to improve its international relations also reflects growing confidence in its own capabilities and enhances its deterrent potential. The US and regional allies will be more deliberate when considering direct military confrontation over the most likely conflict, Taiwan, when faced with greater evidence that a conflict would be costly to both sides. A more technologically capable PLA does not necessarily mean a military conflict is inevitable. What China wants most is to ensure it can build its economy in peace and prevent internal unrest. Taiwan is the focus of its military build-up, but Chinese leaders link Taiwan to their domestic security situation, arguing that the Chinese people could rise up and overthrow the Beijing leadership if Taiwan declared independence. There are indications that China is genuinely interested in avoiding a military conflict as well as increasing transparency. These incidents perhaps indicate that China has moved beyond \"hiding its capabilities\", to reflect President Hu Jintao's vision of establishing a \"harmonious world\". These sentiments give US and European allies an opportunity to capitalise on China's professed interest in increasing transparency and military-to-military exchanges.

        "debiased_text": "Following a period of significant political, social, and economic challenges during the tenure of Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping initiated reforms aimed at prioritizing economic development before addressing military modernization. He adopted a foreign policy approach that emphasized a restrained posture in international affairs, with the strategy of 'biding time and hiding capabilities'. Approximately 30 years after these reforms, China has developed into an economic powerhouse and is gradually increasing its military assertiveness. Nonetheless, there are ongoing questions regarding the capabilities, doctrine, and intent of the Chinese military as it advances technically. The military has experienced a technological upgrade, facilitated by substantial budget increases over the past two decades, which has enhanced access to advanced technology through both legal imports and the recruitment of personnel with technical expertise. This marks a departure from earlier periods when the military was predominantly composed of largely illiterate peasants and adhered to a 'people's war' doctrine, which relied on overwhelming numerical superiority over opposing forces. Incidents involving the People's Liberation Army (PLA) allegedly accessing U.S. and German government computer networks align with this trend of modernization. Additionally, China's successful anti-satellite test in January highlighted a technical ability that had not been previously anticipated. These actions suggest that Chinese military planners, along with civilian leaders, are recognizing the need to employ 'asymmetric' strategies to counter technologically superior military forces by focusing on exploiting their weaknesses. However, the reported intrusion into the Pentagon's computer systems, as described in the Financial Times, and several German government networks should be interpreted cautiously. The data compromised in the Pentagon incident were reportedly unclassified, which implies that China has not yet demonstrated the ability to disrupt critical military computer systems through hacking. The fact that investigators were able to trace the attackers suggests technical limitations on the part of China as well. The Chinese foreign ministry denied involvement in the Pentagon attack, although not the incidents involving German networks. It is possible that these intrusions are part of a broader strategy aimed at obtaining information that supports China's technical development. The Chinese military, similar to the commercial sector, has limited innovation capacity and remains heavily dependent on imported technology, obtained through both legal and illegal methods. Until China enhances its domestic research and development capabilities, there is little indication that it will surpass Western nations in technological advancement. China's military modernization strategy is based on the assumption that it is facing an adversary with superior technological capabilities. While the nation is building its capacity to confront such adversaries directly, it is also seeking to exploit potential vulnerabilities. This strategy was influenced in part by the 1991 Gulf War, where U.S. technological superiority overwhelmed the Iraqi military, which was equipped with Soviet-designed platforms similar to those used by China. Recent events in Iraq have shown some limitations of U.S. military technology and perhaps revealed weaknesses in U.S. reliance on internet, satellites, and information-based warfare in comparison to China's reliance on large troop numbers. China has attempted to ease concerns from regional neighbors and the West by emphasizing that its military modernization is not inherently threatening and that it seeks to act as a responsible global power. In recent years, China has promoted greater transparency by issuing defense 'white papers' and making annual reports to the United Nations on military budget allocations and international arms sales. While some progress may have been made, the accuracy and reliability of these reports remain points of skepticism among critics who argue that they lack substantial detail. China's efforts toward transparency seem to be part of a broader strategy to influence global perceptions regarding its peaceful rise, while also justifying military expenditures to its citizens despite existing rural poverty and underfunded social services. The acknowledgment by China that increased transparency is essential for improving international relations also reflects a growing confidence in its own military capabilities and contributes to its deterrent position. The U.S. and regional allies may become more cautious in considering direct military conflict, particularly over the issue of Taiwan, as more evidence of the potential high costs of such confrontation emerges. A more technologically capable PLA does not necessarily equate to an inevitable military conflict. China's primary objective appears to be ensuring economic development in peace and maintaining domestic stability. While Taiwan is the focus of its military buildup, Chinese leaders associate the island's potential independence with a risk of internal unrest that could challenge the Beijing leadership. There are signs that China is genuinely interested in avoiding military conflict and enhancing transparency. These developments could indicate a shift beyond the earlier 'hiding its capabilities' approach, aligning with President Hu Jintao's vision of fostering a 'harmonious world'. Such statements offer opportunities for U.S. and European allies to engage with China on issues of transparency and military-to-military dialogue."

        "original_text": "By GEOFF DYER, ROBIN KWONG and SUNDEEP TUCKER Shares in China Railway Group jumped 69 per cent on their first day of trading on the Shanghai market yesterday, allaying fears of an imminent collapse in this year's Dollars 90bn boom in listings of Chinese companies. The debut of state-owned China Railway, one of the largest construction contractors in the world, was considered an important barometer of investor sentiment after lacklustre listings of two Chinese companies in Hong Kong over the past fortnight. Shares in the group, which raised Dollars 3bn, rose from an offer price of Rmb4.8 to close at Rmb8.09, within the range of forecasts made by analysts. Although the first-day bounce was well below several other recent mainland flotations, it showed that Chinese investors are still prepared to buy shares in well-known companies. The rise in the share price came in spite of an 18.2 per cent decline in the Shanghai Composite Index during November, the biggest monthly drop in the market in over a decade. \"The first-day performance of China Railway was much stronger than I expected,\" said Zhang Yidong, analyst at Industrial Securities in Shanghai. \"It shows that there is still abundant capital in the market.\" However, Li Xianming at Ping An Securities in Shenzhen said the first-day close was lower than seemed likely a few weeks ago. \"Investors are more conservative than they were before,\" he said. Several analysts said the more important indicator would be how its shares fare once the initial euphoria that can surround listings in Shanghai, has died down. Shares in PetroChina have fallen 37 per cent from their high on the first day of trading in October. China Railway's performance comes after shares in Sinotruk, a truck maker, and Sinotrans Shipping, a dry bulk carrier, last month fell by more than 13 per cent on their first day of trading in Hong Kong. Moreover, investor appetite for smaller IPOs across Asia has started to wane amid volatility in equity markets triggered by fears of a US slowdown. IPOs in the property and aircraft leasing sectors were pulled in Singapore last month, while insurer American International Group yesterday cancelled the listing of property assets in Japan.",

        "title": "Jonathan Freedland: In Iran lies the big test of Brown's political agility",
        "original_text": "If Tony Blair left a handover note for Gordon Brown, I hope he included a warning about best-laid plans. You can draw up all the plans you like, it would have said, but a single, unforeseen event can destroy every last one of them. For Blair it was Iraq. For Brown it could be Iran. If the prime minister fears as much, he gave little inkling of it in his foreign policy speech at the Mansion House on Monday night. As a contrast with Blair it could not have been sharper. Gone was the apocalyptic talk of a battle for civilisation, the ramped-up fear of the Islamist menace, the pleas that we face an epic danger. He did not so much as mention 9/11, still less deliver a sermon on the true nature of Islam. Instead, Brown devoted only a few sentences to Iran and they were sober ones, shorn of all rhetoric. Nevertheless, they did manage to contain the three strands of current thinking on how to deal with Tehran and its nuclear ambitions, artfully keeping each option - carrots, sticks and sharper sticks - in play. Initially, he established that there is indeed a problem to solve. In defiance of those who insist there is no evidence that Iran wants anything more than a civil nuclear capability - a view well represented in the blogosphere, not least among commenters on the Guardian website - Brown drew attention to the fact that Iranian nuclear activity had been \"hidden from the world\" for many years. It is this record of evasion, \"of lying and cheating to the International Atomic Energy Agency\", according to Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform, that has persuaded many otherwise doveish European governments that Tehran is up to something. Grant cites secret nuclear facilities in Iran whose existence was only admitted once dissident groups had revealed them. That is not the only source of suspicion. Those watching are also puzzled as to why the Iranians had documents showing how to cast uranium in hemispheres, a step only required for making warheads. They also ask why, if civil nuclear power is all the Iranians want, they don't simply import enriched uranium from abroad. These signals, and several others, have persuaded governments - and not only those in Washington and Jerusalem - that, even if there is not definitive, fizzing-fuse proof of an Iranian bomb, this is the direction in which the Iranians are heading. Why is that a problem? Israelis would offer an existential answer - \"Because an Iranian nuke would wipe us off the map\" - but Europeans have a different reply. They fear a nuclear Tehran would trigger a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, the most volatile region in the world. Even if you accept that Iran has more justification than most for wanting a deterrent, sandwiched between US forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan and with nuclear Pakistan next door, the danger of proliferation is a real one. Already, several Arab states are showing a sudden interest in \"civil nuclear\" programmes - rather puzzling given their abundance of oil - stirred into action by the mere prospect of an Iranian bomb. It is worth noting that, even though they have been convinced for 40 years that Israel is a nuclear power, Egypt or Saudi Arabia never showed the interest in nukes they're showing now. Unless Iran manages to allay some of these fears in reports due imminently from the EU's Javier Solana and from the IAEA, then the debate will remain fixed not on whether there is a problem, but on solutions. Start with the scariest: military action. Brown was careful not to rule it out - indeed, he even hinted at it: \"Iran should be in no doubt about our seriousness of purpose.\" But is it really possible? No one, not even the wildest neocon crazy, is imagining an Iraq-style invasion: America is too stretched, if nothing else. But a series of air strikes on selected targets, as in 1998's Desert Fox assault on Iraq, is at least under discussion. I'm told that American military planners have drafted fairly detailed sketches of just such an operation. The leading presidential candidates have all stressed that they will not tolerate a nuclear Iran. One US commentator wrote recently that George Bush and Dick Cheney do not look like men about to leave office without getting this done. In this version, Bush believes - incredibly - that the best way to safeguard his legacy is by sorting out Iran before he goes. And Cheney wouldn't trust some future Democrat to do it. But the plain fact is that Bush lacks the political strength, especially in Congress, to act. Those same military planners are counselling against it, while it's widely believed that Bush's defence secretary, Robert Gates, would quit rather than attack Iran. The reasons are obvious: Iran would hit back, through its militias at US troops in Iraq, and through terrorist sleeper cells abroad. What's more, a US-led attack would only entrench the Iranian regime still deeper, not merely prompting it to accelerate its nuclear efforts but crowning it the lead Muslim victim of a western war against Islam. For now, thankfully, these arguments seem to be prevailing in Washington. Which means the next 12 months could see the status quo hold, as the international community hopes that the stick of sanctions will make unnecessary the sharper stick of force. So far, their defenders say, sanctions are having an effect. The first two rounds, agreed by a 15-0 vote in the UN security council, sent a unified message to Tehran that the world was united against it - a position the Iranian elite cannot stand. The trick is to learn from the disaster of sanctions against Iraq and to ensure they hit the right target. That's why Brown promised to tighten the screw on Iran's oil and gas industry and its financial sector. Sanctions are fraught, though. Russia and China gave their approval to the earlier, milder rounds but are foot-dragging now. Beijing has lucrative contracts with Iran and needs its oil; Moscow is in no hurry to avert a war that it believes would heavily reduce America's power in the world. The European focus now is on Germany: if it comes on board, then a joint US-EU raft of sanctions becomes possible. Which brings us to the carrots. Some, though none now in government, reckon the way to deal with Iran is to shower it with carrots, to hug it into submission. One diplomat speculates that had Jack Straw remained as foreign secretary, he would have been to Tehran by now. His aim would have been to appeal to Tehran's wealthy, to have built up the pragmatists around former president Hashemi Rafsanjani and dangle the prospect of an Iranian return to the international fold. If that policy was pursued, runs the logic, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would soon see his power drain away and he, along with George Bush, would be out of office by 2009. No one in power is arguing for an all-hug strategy just now. Instead, it's promised as the reward for good behaviour. Note Brown's offer of \"a transformed relationship with the world\". It all adds up to a delicate geometry, in which every element is connected: sanctions, the possibility of force, and the rewards that will come with compliance. The aim is to alter the Iranian calculus so that pursuing nukes becomes too costly, and giving them up too advantageous, to continue. It's subtle, tricky work - and as big a test of Brown's political agility as there will be. Unless something even harder comes along. freedland@theguardian.com",
        "debiased_text": "If Tony Blair left a handover note for Gordon Brown, it would have likely included a warning about the unpredictability of plans. A single unforeseen event can disrupt even the most well-laid strategies. For Blair, the event was Iraq, and for Brown, it could be Iran. However, the prime minister did not express significant concern about this in his foreign policy speech at the Mansion House on Monday night. His speech contrasted sharply with Blair's, which had included apocalyptic rhetoric about a battle for civilization and emphasized the danger of the Islamist threat. Brown did not mention 9/11, nor did he deliver a sermon on the true nature of Islam. He devoted only a few sentences to Iran, using a sober tone without embellishments. These sentences outlined the three main approaches to addressing Iran's nuclear ambitions: incentives, pressures, and more severe measures. Initially, he acknowledged that there is a problem to solve, in defiance of those who claim there is no evidence that Iran seeks more than a civil nuclear capability. Brown highlighted that Iranian nuclear activity had been concealed from the world for many years, with some European governments convinced that Iran is involved in hidden activities based on its history of deceit with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform pointed to secret nuclear facilities in Iran that were only disclosed after dissident groups revealed them. Other suspicious factors include the presence of documents on casting uranium in hemispheres, a process only relevant for warheads, and the lack of interest in importing enriched uranium, which would be necessary if Iran's aim was only civil nuclear power. These signals have convinced many governments, including those not in Washington or Jerusalem, that Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, even if there is no conclusive evidence. The reason this is important is due to the potential consequences. Israeli officials have stated that an Iranian nuclear weapon would pose an existential threat, while European governments worry about triggering a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, the world's most volatile region. Even though some may argue Iran has more justification than others for seeking a deterrent, given its geopolitical position, the risk of proliferation is significant. Several Arab states have recently shown interest in developing civil nuclear programs, which is unusual given their access to oil. This interest is believed to be sparked by the perceived possibility of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. Unless the concerns of the international community are addressed in the soon-to-be-released reports by the EU's Javier Solana and the IAEA, the debate will remain on solutions rather than whether there is a problem. One potential solution is military action. Brown did not rule out this option, expressing that Iran should have no doubt about the seriousness of the UK's position. However, an invasion of the type seen in Iraq is unlikely, as the US is already stretched thin. While air strikes on selected targets, similar to the 1998 \"Desert Fox\" attack on Iraq, have been discussed, some American military planners have drafted plans for such an operation. Presidential candidates in the US have emphasized that they will not allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons. It has also been suggested that George Bush and Dick Cheney may push for action before leaving office, but Bush currently lacks the political strength to act, especially in Congress. Military planners and some officials within the US government have advised against such action, as Iran would likely retaliate, hurting US troops in Iraq and activating terrorist networks abroad. A US-led attack could strengthen the Iranian regime's resolve, potentially accelerating its nuclear program and positioning Iran as the leading Muslim country targeted in a Western conflict. For now, these arguments are gaining traction in Washington, allowing the status quo to persist as the international community hopes that economic sanctions will convince Iran to abandon its nuclear aspirations. So far, the first two rounds of sanctions, agreed upon by a 15-0 vote in the UN Security Council, have indicated some impact. These sanctions conveyed a unified message to Iran from the global community, a position the Iranian leadership cannot tolerate. The challenge remains to avoid repeating the mistakes of past sanction efforts against Iraq, ensuring that current measures target the right areas. Brown suggested focusing sanctions on Iran's oil and gas industry and its financial sector. However, sanctions are complex, with Russia and China initially supportive but now hesitant. Russia has strategic interests in Iran's oil and geopolitical positioning, while China has significant business ties with Iran and may not want to push for a conflict that would weaken US influence. The European focus has now turned toward Germany, as its support would allow a broader US-EU sanctions package. Turning to the incentives approach, some suggest offering Iran benefits in exchange for cooperation, which could weaken the current leadership. If Jack Straw had remained as foreign secretary, he may have approached Iran differently, targeting wealthy individuals and appealing to pragmatic factions close to former president Hashemi Rafsanjani. This would have aimed to reintegrate Iran into the international community. Currently, however, the focus is on offering incentives as rewards for compliance. Brown emphasized the possibility of a transformed global relationship for Iran if it abandons its nuclear ambitions. This strategy is based on a complex balance of sanctions, the potential for force, and incentives for cooperation. The goal is to change Iran's internal calculations, making nuclear development too costly and relinquishing it too advantageous to ignore. This is considered a delicate and challenging task, and a significant test of Brown's political skills."

        "title": "Why China's Communist Party Congress Could Shake Up Companies and Stocks; Why China's Communist Party Congress Could Shake Up Companies and Stocks",
        "original_text": "Beijing -- Wrangling among China's political elite in the coming months ahead of a pivotal Communist Party meeting could leave some foreign investors scratching their heads about their China portfolios. The Communist Party Congress, an event held every five years at which key leadership appointments and policies are unveiled, is likely to create uncertainty in the management of some Chinese state- controlled companies, analysts say. As the heads of those companies are ultimately appointed by the party, the congress could lead to management shuffling or policy changes that affect the firms. Those changes -- or speculation that they could come -- might lead to increased volatility in the share prices of the affected companies, especially because there is often little transparency for investors over those decisions. But analysts say that, in general, investors shouldn't be too alarmed. \"The stock market could fluctuate a bit when all kinds of new information, announcements and policies could be released,\" says Xu Wei, an analyst with TX Investment Consulting Co. in Shanghai. Investors may want to \"watch over the stock market for a bit\" and \"make new decisions about their shares when everything . . . is clear.\" But because overall government policy is usually stable, it \"won't have big impact on the stock market\" in the long run, he says. The congress is expected to be held this autumn, although no exact date has been announced. Its primary focus is on broader party policies, but the potential ramifications for business are a reminder of the way national politics continue to affect how China Inc. is run. Since the last meeting, in November 2002, many more of China's big state firms have become public companies, meaning that any related changes are now much more significant for global investors. China's banks and telecommunications and energy companies rank among the biggest in their industries world-wide. In banking, China has already begun rotations of senior personnel ahead of the congress by moving two regulatory officials to clean up two of its weakest run institutions. Agricultural Bank of China and China Everbright Bank Co. have received new chairmen dispatched from regulatory agencies, moves analysts see as catalysts for speeding up preparations for initial public offerings. China Everbright Bank is majority-owned by state-controlled conglomerate China Everbright Group and its China Everbright Ltd. arm, which is listed in Hong Kong. \"Pretty much all the heads of the large state-owned banks will rotate in the next few months,\" predicts Victor Shih, a professor of Chinese politics at Northwestern University in Illinois. \"Those remaining will be the exception rather than the rule.\" While public listings have led to some improvements in corporate governance, such as the creation of corporate boards with some outside directors, disclosure of such changes is often slow and unclear. In the case of China Everbright Bank, the government's appointment of Tang Shuangning as chairman was announced to bank staff in mid- June. Reports of his appointment quickly began filtering out in the media. Everbright Ltd., which owns 21.4% of the bank, rose 5% on June 22, the day after Hong Kong media reported Mr. Tang's appointment. No official word came from the listed company until a July 16 statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. In some cases, slow or spotty disclosure can make it hard to discern which management changes are routine and which aren't. In one surprise case, Chen Tonghai's tenure as chairman of China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. ended abruptly. The company, known as Sinopec, said on June 22 that Mr. Chen had resigned, effective immediately, for \"personal reasons.\" There was no further explanation. Since news of his resignation, Sinopec's shares have fallen 16% in Hong Kong amid Chinese media reports alleging his exit was because of corruption investigations. Mr. Chen hasn't commented. Neither the company -- Asia's biggest oil refiner by capacity -- nor the Chinese government commented further. Stocks Mostly Stabilize, With London Rising 3% Financial markets around the globe stabilized, recovering some of last week's losses as investors took heart from central banks' moves to calm money markets. European shares posted their largest one-day rise in 15 months, and Asian stocks also mostly advanced. \"It's going to be volatile, as credit markets sort themselves out, but we believe that the underlying strength of the global economy and attractive global equity valuations will stop markets short of meltdown,\" said Tim Harris, markets strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank. In LONDON, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index posted its biggest one-day point gain in more than four years, closing up 3%, or 180.70 points, at 6219.00. Mining shares led the gainers, with copper miner Kazakhmys up 10% after an upgrade to buy at UBS. Antofagasta rose 11%, Rio Tinto added 7.1% and Anglo American gained 8.3%. In TOKYO, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies rose 0.2% to 16800.05. But investors took a cautious view toward financials. Shares of Mitsubishi UFJ fell 1.7% and Mizuho Financial Group closed 1.2% lower. Shares of auto makers recovered part of their losses from Friday, with Honda Motor and Nissan Motor adding 0.5% each. --- Sue Feng contributed to this article. Enlarge this image.",
        "debiased_text": "Beijing -- Upcoming events related to China's political structure prior to a significant Communist Party meeting may create uncertainty for some foreign investors regarding their investments in Chinese companies. The Communist Party Congress, which occurs every five years and involves key leadership appointments and policy announcements, has the potential to influence the management and operations of state-controlled enterprises. These companies are ultimately managed by party-appointed officials, which may lead to changes in leadership or policy. Such changes or expectations of them could result in increased stock price volatility for affected firms due to limited transparency for investors. However, experts suggest that investors should not be overly concerned, as overall government policy typically remains stable and is unlikely to have major long-term effects on the stock market. The congress is anticipated to take place this autumn, although no specific date has been confirmed. Its main focus will be on broader party policies; however, the implications for business reportedly highlight the influence of national politics on the operations of Chinese enterprises. Since the previous meeting in November 2002, a greater number of large state-owned firms in China have become publicly listed, making any related changes more relevant to global investors. Chinese banks, telecommunications, and energy companies are among the largest in their respective industries worldwide. In preparation for the congress, some senior officials within the banking sector have already been rotated, with two regulatory officials assigned to two of the country's weaker banks, Agricultural Bank of China and China Everbright Bank Co. Analysts view these moves as potentially accelerating the banks' readiness for initial public offerings. China Everbright Bank is primarily owned by the state-controlled China Everbright Group and its listed subsidiary, China Everbright Ltd., based in Hong Kong. According to Victor Shih, a professor of Chinese politics at Northwestern University in Illinois, it is likely that most directors of the major state-owned banks will be replaced in the next few months, with those remaining being the exception. While public listings have brought some improvements to corporate governance, such as the inclusion of independent directors on corporate boards, the disclosure of these changes is often delayed or unclear. In the case of China Everbright Bank, an official announcement regarding the appointment of Tang Shuangning as chairman was made to bank staff in mid-June. Media reports on the appointment began circulating shortly thereafter. Share prices for Everbright Ltd., which holds a 21.4% stake in the bank, increased by 5% on June 22, following media coverage of Mr. Tang's appointment. The listed company provided an official statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on July 16. In some instances, slow or inconsistent disclosure can complicate the identification of routine versus significant management changes. One notable example was the sudden end of Chen Tonghai's tenure as chairman of China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec), which was announced on June 22 for 'personal reasons.' The company provided no additional explanation. Following his resignation, Sinopec's shares decreased by 16% in Hong Kong amid media reports linking his departure to corruption investigations. Mr. Chen has not made any public comments, and neither the company, which is Asia's largest oil refiner by capacity, nor the Chinese government has provided further information. Financial markets worldwide showed signs of stabilization, recovering some of the previous week's losses as investors responded positively to actions by central banks aimed at easing money markets. European shares recorded their highest one-day increase in 15 months, and Asian stocks generally rose. Tim Harris, a markets strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, stated that while credit markets are expected to remain volatile, the resilience of the global economy and the appeal of global equity valuations should prevent markets from experiencing a severe downturn. In London, the UK's FTSE 100 index saw its largest one-day point increase in over four years, rising 3%, or 180.70 points, to close at 6219.00. Mining sector shares led the gains, with Kazakhmys up 10% following a 'buy' rating from UBS. Antofagasta rose 11%, Rio Tinto added 7.1%, and Anglo American increased by 8.3%. In Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies rose 0.2% to 16800.05. Investors remained cautious about financial sector stocks, with Mitsubishi UFJ shares falling 1.7% and Mizuho Financial Group closing 1.2% lower. Shares of automobile manufacturers recovered some of the losses incurred the previous day, with Honda Motor and Nissan Motor each increasing by 0.5%."

        "original_text": "From Prof T. N. Srinivasan. Sir, By claiming that much of the success attributed to globalisation is in fact the success of one giant country, China (\"The global economy through rose-tinted glasses\", May 1), Robert Wade completely ignores the other giant: India. India's average annual rate of growth of per capita real gross domestic product was around 1.5 per cent in the period 1950-80. In the 1980s, the rate more than doubled to around 3.7 per cent, and then accelerated to 4.1 per cent during the 1990s. It has grown further to 5.3 per cent since then. Poverty, estimated as the proportion of the population having consumption below a modest national poverty line (rather than World Bank's poverty lines, which have very weak analytical underpinnings), fluctuated at around 50 per cent during 1950-1978. It declined to 39 per cent in 1987-88, 36 per cent in 1993-94, and to 27.5 per cent in 2004-05. Had the poverty ratio in India remained unchanged at 50 per cent after 1977-78, the number of poor in 2004- 05 would have been 547m, more than twice what it was: namely, 238m. In the 1980s, rapid growth was associated with some piecemeal liberalisation of the external sector away from virtual autarky, but it was also associated with fiscal profligacy, which culminated in a severe macro-economic crisis in 1991. Across the board, systemic reforms introduced after the crisis have included substantial liberalisation of foreign trade and investment, although fiscal consolidation is yet to be achieved. At Prof Wade's level of analysis based on association, there is no doubt that India's substantial poverty reduction has been associated with liberalisation of the economy, including, importantly, its external sector.

        "debiased_text": "From Prof T. N. Srinivasan. Sir, By stating that much of the success attributed to globalisation is actually the success of China, Robert Wade's article ('The global economy through rose-tinted glasses', May 1) does not reference the role of India. India's average annual rate of growth of per capita real gross domestic product was approximately 1.5 per cent during the period 1950-80. This rate increased to around 3.7 per cent in the 1980s and further accelerated to 4.1 per cent in the 1990s. Since then, it has reached 5.3 per cent. According to estimates using a national poverty line, the proportion of the population below the poverty line fluctuated around 50 per cent between 1950 and 1978. It subsequently decreased to 39 per cent in 1987-88, 36 per cent in 1993-94, and 27.5 per cent in 2004-05. If the poverty ratio in India had remained at 50 per cent after 1977-78, the number of people living in poverty in 2004-05 would have been approximately 547 million, compared to the actual figure of 238 million. In the 1980s, rapid economic growth was accompanied by some limited liberalisation of the external sector, moving away from a largely closed economy. However, this period also included fiscal mismanagement, which led to a significant macroeconomic crisis in 1991. Following the crisis, comprehensive reforms were implemented, including substantial liberalisation of foreign trade and investment, although fiscal consolidation has not yet been fully achieved. At the level of analysis presented by Prof Wade, it is evident that India's notable poverty reduction has been associated with economic liberalisation, particularly in its external sector. T. N.

        "title": "22 dead as Chinese bridge collapses",
        "original_text": "At least 22 people were killed today when a newly-built bridge collapsed in central China, raising fresh concerns about safety standards amid a nationwide construction boom. Just weeks before it was scheduled to open, the 328m stone bridge over the River Tuo in central Hunan province broke apart and fell into the waters below. More than 100 workers were removing scaffolding when the accident happened, and the death toll could rise significantly higher. According to local media, 22 people were injured and 46 are still missing. Most of the workers were local farmers, supplementing their incomes by labouring on the bridge, which was designed to improve transport links in Fenghuang - a popular tourist spot. In an attempt to fit in with the aesthetically attractive local community, which is famous for Miao minority houses on stilts, the bridge was built with four decorative arches. Much of that is now rubble. \"I was riding a bike with my husband and we had just passed under the bridge and were about 50 meters away when it collapsed,\" a witness who only gave her surname, Wu, told the Associated Press. \"There was a huge amount of dust that came up and didn't clear for about 10 minutes.\" Rescue efforts are continuing, with bulldozers attempting to clear the debris so that emergency teams can search for survivors. The cause of the collapse is under investigation. According to Xinhua news agency, the 12m yuan (£800,000) project was contracted out to the state-owned Hunan Road and Bridge Construction group. The construction manager and project supervisor have been detained for questioning. It is the second fatal accident this year involving a bridge collapse. Nine people were killed in June when a section of a bridge in Guangdong province collapsed after a cargo vessel ran into one of its pillars. Amid a period of breakneck economic growth, local media have expressed concern that some contractors may be cutting corners in the rush to build bridges, roads and tower blocks, while local governments put too much emphasis on new projects while failing to invest properly in maintaining old structures. According to The China Daily, the government has catergorised 6,300 bridges as dangerous because of structural damage. Xiao Rucheng, the secretary general of China's Institute of Bridge and Structural Engineering, was quoted as saying that many of the country's new bridges were being built too quickly and were poorly designed. Other architects said there may be more accidents now, but the main reason is that there are more projects. \"China has done a good job of managing rapid construction growth,\" said Huang Nannan, an associate at Arup. \"But there not enough attention is paid to the technical review of small and medium-sized projects.\" Mr Huang said China had been building stone arch bridges for hundreds of years. \"In this accident, we have lost face because modern engineers did a worse job than our ancestors.\"",

Huang Nannan, an associate at Arup, noted that China has managed rapid construction growth effectively but emphasized the lack of sufficient technical review for smaller projects. He added that China has a long history of constructing stone arch bridges and that the recent accident may reflect a decline in engineering standards compared to past practices."

        "title": "Immigration drives an economic revival",
        "original_text": "Something strange is happening in Herefordshire. One of Britain's most rural counties has for years fretted about the prospect of a dwindling workforce as urban pensioners, attracted by the good life, pour in, swapping places with local youngsters heading for the cities. While this has been good news for affluent professionals wanting to pick up a cheap weekend home, the outflux of workers to urban areas has led to fears some parts of the county's economy may become unsustainable. But there are signs this is starting to change. \"Rural schools are filling up, shops and post offices that might have closed are staying open,\" says Harriet Yellin, diversity officer with Hereford county council. \"Anecdotally, we are hearing there are a number of small businesses that would have had to close by now if it wasn't for this.\" \"This\" is the influx of foreign workers, chiefly from eastern Europe, who are entering the county looking for work. The influx started with a trickle of workers three years ago and has become a steady stream. While the vast majority are from Poland and Ukraine (see graph) there are also immigrants from the Philippines and China. Herefordshire has always attracted foreign labour for seasonal work such as fruit harvesting or hop-picking. But now foreign workers are looking for permanent jobs, and the type of immigrant is changing. \"Many foreign workers are working well below their capabilities,\" Yellin says. \"We have qualified doctors and engineers working as waiters.\" The influx is creating new challenges for the local council. \"As a local authority, we have a duty to promote social cohesion,\" Yellin says. \"But it's proving difficult. There aren't identifiable communities to reach out to. There's a Russian-speaking group and a Polish group based around the Catholic church, but these are very small groups. Trying to reach all these people is a real challenge.\" The same could be true when it comes to reaching the indigenous population. \"Fear of otherness\" is not simply confined to urban areas, such as Slough, which has seen a huge influx of Poles in the last two years, something that has triggered ugly headlines about culture clashes. Locals in Herefordshire, too, mutter about the \"foreign invasion\". \"There are myths we have to puncture,\" Yellin admits. \"Some people think they are coming here to claim benefits, but in general it has been plain sailing.\" Racial tensions It is a different story, however, over in Boston, Lincolnshire. Tensions in the small market town have become inflamed as a large number of Portuguese workers have moved in. The local council estimates that more than 10% of the town's 55,000-strong population is now comprised of Portuguese people. In 2001, the largest ethnic community in Boston was comprised of 161 Chinese people. Today, add in the eastern Europeans and a raft of other nationalities, and it is estimated more than 15,000 people in Boston are from abroad. Despite this, unemployment in Boston stands at only 3.9%, suggesting the influx of foreign labour is vital. But, given the dramatic change in the town's demography, it is unsurprising there have been flashpoints. During the 2004 European football championships there was rioting in the town centre after Portugal beat England. The windows of the town's Portuguese-owned pub have been smashed. The problems facing the town's Portuguese community were encapsulated in a video art project, displayed in the town's railway station, in which an immigrant mother from Portugal describes the racist abuse her seven-year-old daughter suffered. The work's original title was I Hate Boston and Boston Hates Me but this was changed to the less incendiary Boston. In a bid to calm the situation the local council has taken a number of small-scale steps to improve social cohesion. Some are simply practical. The influx of foreign labour in Boston, for example, has placed greater pressure on refuse collection. The council has now issued more wheelie bins in a bid to prevent refuse piling up in the street. A website has been created, explaining to foreign workers, albeit in English, how to access local services such as signing up with a doctor. The local college now offers English classes to 47 different nationalities. The classes are arranged over different times, allowing workers to drop in for lessons. Room for improvement And yet, despite these small-scale success stories, it is clear far more needs to be done. Part of the problem is gauging the scale of the foreign workers' needs. The Local Government Association (LGA) believes the government has massively underestimated the number of foreign workers who are now residing in the UK, a failure that has placed significant pressures on local infrastructure. For example, figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest there are around 300 eastern European workers in Slough. External consultants estimate the true figure to be between 6,000 and 9,000. \"It's extremely difficult to get a handle on the situation,\" says Richard Stokoe, of the LGA. \"The estimates are around 18 months out of date.\" They could also be about to change dramatically, according to Stokoe. \"You've got young, fit males coming over here finding jobs. They're getting flats and now they're looking to bring their families over.\" The nature of much of the work in rural areas brings additional challenges for local authorities. Many foreign workers are found employment by agencies or gangmasters who also supply them with accommodation. Rent is subtracted from their wages and this can make them vulnerable to exploitation. The Commission for Rural Communities (CRC), reports that a number of housing authorities in rural areas have had to find emergency accommodation for foreign workers who have been turfed out by gangmasters. Ensuring the influx of foreign labour is not used to undercut the wages of domestic employees is another key challenge. The Low Pay Commission's last annual report expressed concerns that the growing use of migrant workers was being used by unscrupulous employers to circumvent the minimum wage. The CRC, though, admits it is unable to gauge to what extent this is happening. A recent report issued by the commission concludes: \"The flexible nature of much migrant work makes it currently impossible to accurately measure the contribution and impacts of migrant workers.\" Successfully dealing with the challenges posed by immigrant workers in rural areas promises to yield real benefits. Rural areas host 30% of the country's businesses and their annual turnover has increased by 10% in five years to more than £320bn, according to the CRC. But with an older population, the countryside may find it difficult to sustain this growth without what is being called the \"Ryanair labour force\". As Yellin acknowledges: \"Foreign workers are meeting an important need.\"",
        "debiased_text": "Herefordshire has experienced a shift in population dynamics in recent years, with changes impacting local communities and the economy. Previously, concerns centered around a declining local workforce as urban pensioners moved into the county, while younger residents left for urban areas. This migration has benefited some segments of the economy, such as those involved in property, but raised concerns about the sustainability of certain economic sectors due to the outflux of workers. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of foreign workers entering the county, particularly from Eastern Europe, the Philippines, and China, seeking employment opportunities. This trend has been noticeable for three years and has grown from a small number of workers to a steady flow.\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that the presence of foreign workers has helped sustain local businesses, including schools, shops, and post offices, which might otherwise have faced closure. Many of these workers are employed in roles that may not fully match their qualifications, such as doctors and engineers working as waiters. The local council, Hereford County Council, has acknowledged the challenge of promoting social cohesion in the area, noting that foreign workers come from a variety of backgrounds and do not form large, identifiable communities. This complicates community outreach efforts.\n\nIn Boston, Lincolnshire, demographic changes have been more pronounced. The local council estimates that over 10% of the town's population, which is approximately 55,000, consists of Portuguese residents, with additional numbers from Eastern Europe and other nationalities. Unemployment in Boston remains low at 3.9%, highlighting the economic importance of foreign labor. However, the town has faced social tensions; for instance, during the 2004 European football championships, there was a riot in the town center following a Portugal vs. England match, which led to damage to a Portuguese-owned pub. A video art project displayed at the town's railway station depicted the experiences of a Portuguese immigrant mother whose child faced racist abuse, with the original title 'I Hate Boston and Boston Hates Me' later changed to 'Boston' to reduce controversy.\n\nIn an effort to improve social cohesion, the local council in Boston has implemented several measures. These include providing additional wheelie bins to address increased pressure on refuse collection, offering a website in English to help foreign workers access services, such as registering with a doctor, and providing English language classes at the local college for 47 different nationalities. These classes are offered at various times to accommodate workers' schedules.\n\nDespite these efforts, challenges remain in accurately assessing the needs of foreign workers. The Local Government Association (LGA) has indicated that government data significantly underestimates the number of foreign workers in the UK, creating concerns for local infrastructure. For example, while the Office for National Statistics estimates that about 300 Eastern European workers live in Slough, external consultants assume the actual number is much higher, between 6,000 and 9,000. Richard Stokoe of the LGA notes that the data is approximately 18 months outdated and that significant changes may be occurring.\n\nAdditionally, the nature of employment in rural areas has raised concerns. Many foreign workers are employed through agencies or gangmasters who also provide their housing. This arrangement can make workers vulnerable to exploitation, with rent often deducted from their wages. The Commission for Rural Communities (CRC) has reported that some housing authorities have had to offer emergency accommodation to foreign workers who have been evicted by gangmasters. There is also concern about the potential use of migrant labor to undercut domestic workers' wages, though the CRC admits it is difficult to measure the extent of this occurrence.\n\nRural areas in the UK account for 30% of the country's businesses, and their annual turnover has increased by 10% over five years to more than £320 billion. Maintaining this growth may depend on the presence of foreign workers, often referred to as the 'Ryanair labour force' due to their mobility. Harriet Yellin from Hereford County Council acknowledges that foreign workers are fulfilling important roles in the local economy."

        "original_text": "Maurice \"Hank\" Greenberg is back in business in China, launching a small private-equity fund aimed at the nation's IPO issuance. The former chairman of American International Group Inc. will be pursuing deals through a joint venture he has set up with Citic Securities Co., China's fifth-largest brokerage house by assets. Mr. Greenberg has been entertaining investments in China since his departure from AIG in 2005 amid an accounting investigation by Eliot Spitzer, then New York's attorney general. The Citic venture appears to be Mr. Greenberg's first formal business deal in China since he left the insurance giant. Starr International Co., the U.S. investment vehicle Mr. Greenberg controls, and Citic Securities will narrow their scope to buying stakes in Chinese companies planning initial public offerings, according to a filing Citic made with the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Citic said each party will invest as much as 500 million yuan, or about $64 million, in the 50-50 joint venture. While Western investors have pledged to spend billions of dollars on private-equity deals in China, few of the transactions have been buyouts for management control. Pre-IPO financing, however, in which investors buy private stakes months before a public stock offering, have proved lucrative, as the value of China's listed companies is soaring. The MSCI China A index, which tracks domestically listed stocks, has more than doubled in the past 12 months. At AIG, Mr. Greenberg secured the first life-insurance license China awarded to a foreign company, and for decades has cultivated close ties with Chinese officials. In Mr. Greenberg, 81 years old, Citic has the executive who built AIG, of New York, into a global financial powerhouse and can provide contacts and business expertise. The joint venture fits Citic's aspirations to position itself as a gateway for Chinese companies looking to tap the Shanghai and Hong Kong capital markets. \"We want to be a first-class investment bank concentrating on Chinese business,\" Ted Tokuchi, head of Citic Securities' investment- banking division, said in an interview. \"With greater competition from Goldman Sachs and others, we have to adjust our corporate strategy by doing more types of business.\" The firm plans to expand its Hong Kong operations this year by building its research team and underwriting its first IPO there. A spokeswoman for Mr. Greenberg declined to comment on the venture. The Chinese brokerage house brings domestic political clout to the business. Its state-owned parent, Citic Group, has done big deals, such as the recent purchase of the Kazakhstan oil assets of Canada's Nations Energy Co. for $1.9 billion. In China, the Citic conglomerate's leadership has closely followed the footsteps of its founder, the country's former vice president, Rong Yiren. Last year, Shanghai-listed Citic Securities, the only major publicly traded brokerage house in China, snagged a 24% market share for domestic Class A share fund raising, helping Chinese companies raise a combined 284.5 billion yuan in IPOs, additional share issuance and convertible bonds, according to the firm's own data. Class A shares are those denominated in yuan and available mainly to domestic investors. Citic Securities has yet to take a Chinese company into international capital markets. Mr. Tokuchi said that in the next few months he hopes to take its sister company, Citic Bank Co., public in a dual IPO in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Mr. Tokuchi said his firm aims to turn itself into a one-stop shop for Chinese companies seeking to raise money. That market has a two- tier system, in which Chinese brokerage houses dominate underwriting of domestic listings and global investment banks are called in for the overseas IPOs. On the flip side of Citic's strategy, global banks -- such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG -- are trying to leverage their own investment-banking joint ventures on the mainland to gain a role in deals on the Shanghai exchange. Chinese regulators have pushed overseas-listed state giants such as Bank of China to issue shares domestically. Citic Securities' domestic trading and underwriting business has boomed with the revival of the mainland's stock market. Earlier this month, the firm said it expected 2006 net profit to have increased more than fivefold from the previous year. It has used some of its revenue to expand its 220-branch network, buying up smaller, struggling brokerages as part of a government push to consolidate the securities sector. Enlarge this image.",

(AIG) in 2005 following an accounting investigation by Eliot Spitzer, who was then the New York attorney general. This joint venture marks Greenberg's first formal business arrangement in China since his departure from AIG.\n\nStarr International Co., the investment company controlled by Greenberg, and Citic Securities have outlined their focus on acquiring stakes in Chinese companies with upcoming IPOs, as stated in a filing with the Shanghai Stock Exchange. According to the filing, both parties will contribute up to 500 million yuan (approximately $64 million) each to the 50-50 joint venture.\n\nWhile Western investors have committed significant funds to private-equity deals in China, most transactions have not resulted in management buyouts. Pre-IPO financing, which involves investing in private companies months before they go public, has proven to be a profitable strategy, given the increasing value of Chinese listed companies. The MSCI China A index, which follows domestic listings, has increased by more than double in the last 12 months.\n\nGreenberg, who previously held leadership roles at AIG, was instrumental in obtaining the first life-insurance license granted to a foreign company in China. He has also maintained connections with Chinese officials over the years. Citic Securities benefits from Greenberg's experience and established network in the financial industry.\n\nThe joint venture aligns with Citic Securities' goal of becoming a strategic gateway for Chinese companies seeking to access the Shanghai and Hong Kong capital markets. Ted Tokuchi, head of Citic Securities' investment-banking division, stated in an interview that the firm aims to provide comprehensive services for Chinese companies raising capital. He also mentioned that the company plans to expand its Hong Kong operations by enhancing its research team and underwriting its first IPO there in the coming months.\n\nCitic Securities represents a state-owned enterprise, Citic Group, which has completed major transactions, including the acquisition of oil assets from Nations Energy Co. of Canada in Kazakhstan for $1.9 billion.

He emphasized the firm's aspiration to become a one-stop shop for Chinese enterprises looking to raise capital. The Chinese capital market operates under a two-tier system, where domestic brokerage firms handle underwriting for local listings, and global investment banks are typically involved in overseas IPOs.\n\nConcurrently, global banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG, are working to strengthen their positions in mainland China through joint ventures, aiming to play a role in deals on the Shanghai exchange. Chinese regulatory authorities have encouraged state-owned enterprises that are listed overseas, such as Bank of China, to issue shares domestically. Citic Securities has experienced growth in its domestic trading and underwriting business due to the resurgence of the mainland stock market. Earlier this month, the firm reported that its expected 2006 net profit had increased more than fivefold compared to the previous year. Some of its revenue has been allocated to expanding its branch network, which currently consists of 220 branches, and acquiring smaller, struggling brokerages as part of a government initiative to consolidate the securities sector."

        "original_text": "With Jason Overdorf in New Delhi Under the blazing sun outside Harbin, in northeast China, Tiger No. 31 trots alongside a van packed with Chinese and foreign tourists. The van stops. The driver chucks a live chicken out the window. The 250-kilogram Siberian tiger pounces. Cameras snap away in morbid fascination. It wasn't a pretty end for the chicken, to be sure. And if a proposed lifting of a Chinese ban on the sale of tiger parts goes through, the fate of Tiger No. 31, currently a resident of this tiger park and breeding farm, may not be much better. After he dies, his bones will be crushed up into potions for treating rheumatism. His skin will be turned into a jacket. And his penis and testicles--the original Viagra, according to some Chinese--will be slurped up in soup by an aging believer looking to give his sex life some oomph. By some accounts, the market in tiger-driven medicine brought in more than $12 million a year before China banned the sale of tiger parts in 1993, helping to stabilize wild-tiger populations that were perilously close to extinction. Now some Chinese officials--under fierce lobbying from tiger farmers and would-be parts peddlers--want to lift the injunction to regain that lost market. That's alarmed conservationists, who fear that scrapping the ban could undo the progress of the last 14 years. Eric Dinerstein, chief scientist at the World Wildlife Fund, says flatly: \"Lifting the ban on the tiger trade would spell the end for a number of wild-tiger populations across Asia.\" On its surface, the idea of creating a regulated market for tiger parts has a certain appeal--and not just for the farmers. Chinese officials and others note that demand for such parts persists regardless of the ban. \"It will be a waste if the resources of dead tigers aren't used for traditional medicine,\" said wildlife-conservation official Wang Wei. Legalizing the trade, they argue, could actually help protect wild tigers by reducing the incentive for illegal poaching. Free-market proponents point to the case of wild crocodiles. For the past few decades, many countries have allowed a regulated trade in captive-bred crocodile skins and other parts from farms or ranches. Even many conservationists agree this has helped save some (though not all) wild-crocodile populations from poachers. But, they say, comparisons between crocs and tigers don't hold, in part because tigers are far more expensive to raise than crocodiles, upping the incentive to poach instead of farm. \"In India you can poison a tiger for less than a dollar,\" says Belinda Wright, founder of the Wildlife Protection Society of India. \"Raising one in captivity will cost $3,500 to $10,000.\" What's more, say conservationists (who almost unanimously supported a U.N. resolution last month against lifting the ban), tiger parts from places like India--which has the world's largest wild-tiger population--could be trafficked to China. There buyers would have no way to distinguish illegal parts from legal ones, which means poached tigers and parts could be \"laundered\" as farmed ones. \"Law-enforcement controls are not in place in China to police the tiger-farm trade,\" says the WWF's Dinerstein.",

Outside Harbin, in northeast China, a Siberian tiger known as Tiger No. 31 is walking alongside a van containing both Chinese and foreign tourists. The van stops, and the driver throws a live chicken out the window. Tiger No. 31 jumps on the chicken. Cameras capture the moment. The chicken's fate was not favorable. Tiger No. 31 is currently housed at a tiger park and breeding facility. Following the death of the tiger, its bones would be processed into medicinal concoctions for rheumatism treatment, its skin would be used to make a jacket, and its reproductive organs would be used in a soup, according to some traditional practices. Prior to the Chinese ban on tiger parts in 1993, the market for tiger-based medicine reportedly generated over $12 million annually, contributing to the stabilization of wild tiger populations that were at risk of extinction. Some Chinese officials are now considering lifting the ban, following lobbying from tiger farmers and those interested in selling tiger parts. This has raised concerns among conservationists, who argue that repealing the ban could reverse the progress made in tiger conservation over the past 14 years. Eric Dinerstein, chief scientist at the World Wildlife Fund, stated that lifting the ban on the tiger trade could lead to the extinction of several wild tiger populations across Asia. The concept of establishing a regulated market for tiger parts has some appeal, particularly to farmers. Chinese officials and others have noted that demand for these parts continues despite the ban. Wang Wei, a wildlife-conservation official, stated that it would be a waste not to use the resources of dead tigers for traditional medicine. Proponents of legalization argue that it could help protect wild tigers by reducing the incentive for illegal poaching, citing the example of wild crocodiles. For several decades, many countries have permitted regulated trade in crocodile skins and other parts from farms or ranches, which they claim has helped protect some wild crocodile populations. However, conservationists point out that this comparison is not entirely valid, as tigers are significantly more expensive to raise in captivity than crocodiles, potentially increasing the incentive for poaching. Belinda Wright, founder of the Wildlife Protection Society of India, said that in India, it is possible to poison a tiger for less than a dollar, while raising one in captivity costs between $3,500 and $10,000. Additionally, tiger parts from India, which is home to the world's largest wild tiger population, might be smuggled into China, where they could be difficult to differentiate from legal parts, leading to the laundering of poached tiger parts as farmed ones. Dinerstein from the WWF mentioned that law-enforcement controls in China are currently not sufficient to regulate the trade of tiger parts from farms."

        "original_text": "Shanghai -- China's benchmark stock index topped 5000 for the first time, a milestone reflecting continued enthusiasm by individual investors but also highlighting the risks of a painful bust. The Shanghai Composite Index ended at 5032.49, a gain in the session of 1.1%. The record close put the benchmark index about five times higher than it was in July 2005, when the market bottomed out at an eight-year low. The index holds an 88% gain for the year so far, making it the world's best-performing major market. China's gains have come on a surge of enthusiasm from millions of individual investors who appear to fear missing the bull run more than the potential for losing money. Investors have also appeared to defy government efforts to cool buying by such means as, for example, this week's interest-rate increase. Nor has China's ascent been slowed by the collapse in the U.S. subprime-mortgage market that has rocked financial systems elsewhere. While the speed of the gains has raised analyst concerns, authorities don't have an easy way of cooling the temperature. \"The problem is how to deflate the bubble just a little, keep prices high and not get blamed if the bubble bursts,\" Donald Straszheim, vice chairman of California-based Roth Capital Partners, wrote in a report. An interest-rate increase announced Tuesday by the People's Bank of China, the fourth this year, has done little to damp stock-buying enthusiasm. The central bank lifted deposit rates by a wider margin than it raised lending rates, which was seen as an attempt to encourage Chinese savers to leave their money in banks instead of funneling it into stocks. Investors in China have played down fundamentals that suggest stocks are vulnerable to a correction after such a tremendous rise and have instead maintained a widespread belief that stocks will remain supported in coming months. More than a million new investor accounts have been opened so far this month, and individuals continue to say they will buy after any fall in prices. Doubts that the government intends to stop the market are widespread. \"If the government really wanted to prevent the market from going up, it wouldn't have let the market cross the 4000 level, let alone 5000,\" said Xu Yinghui, an analyst at Guotai Junan Securities. Meanwhile, capital-control rules make it difficult for the subprime turmoil that has churned stocks, bonds and currencies elsewhere around the world to directly affect China's financial markets, though China's export base is considered at risk if U.S. consumer consumption weakens. Global money managers trade in China mainly through a quota system equal to less than 1% of the $2.8 trillion capitalization of the country's stock market. That means foreigners have virtually no access to a market that has been among the top performers in each of the past two years. Only last November, the Shanghai index pulled above 2000 for the first time, followed by 3000 in March and 4000 in May. The continuing boom has raised worries a bubble has formed, sparking various government actions that appear aimed at least partly at cooling the market fever. Foreigners do have access to stocks of Chinese companies that trade in overseas markets, most notably Hong Kong. Prices for those same Chinese companies when quoted in Shanghai are often as much as 50% more than in Hong Kong. Some investors in China say the price in Hong Kong could ultimately rise near the Shanghai level, and hopes for the Hong Kong market are running high following a policy change that gives Chinese investors more access to that market. Japanese Shares Surge; European Markets Also Rise In addition to China's rally, other Asian stocks were lifted by a wave of buying yesterday, as a strong showing by U.S. markets overnight encouraged investors who had been spooked by the recent global credit turmoil. Meanwhile, European shares closed slightly higher, marking their fifth winning session in a row with retailers among the biggest gainers, though markets fell back from highs after a mixed opening on Wall Street. In TOKYO, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies gained 2.6%, or 415.68 points, to 16316.32, helped by the impact of the weaker yen on exports. Pacific Metals soared 13%. Buyers in Japan were inspired by the yen's weakening and word from the Bank of Japan that it won't raise interest rates for now. In HONG KONG, the Hang Seng surged 2.8% to 22966.97, its fourth straight day of gains. In that time, it has risen 12.7%. In SEOUL, South Korea's Kospi rose 2.3% to 1799.72, coming close to recovering all the losses it incurred during the rout the previous Thursday and Friday. In SYDNEY, Australia's S&P/ASX200 stock index rose 2.5% to 6149.70, a level it hadn't touched in nearly two weeks. BHP Billiton, the world's largest miner, jumped 6.5% a day after posting strong results. Traders in Australia said they were encouraged by news that Bank of America had made an equity investment of $2 billion in Countrywide Financial. In LONDON, the FTSE index closed up 0.90 point to 6196.90. U.K. home-loan provider Northern Rock closed up 4%, as its recent share- price slump could, according to some in London, make the company a tempting takeover target. --- Sun Yan contributed to this article.

        "debiased_text": "Shanghai -- China's benchmark stock index reached a new high of 5032.49, marking a 1.1% increase for the session. This level represents a significant rise compared to its July 2005 low, which was an eight-year low. The index has experienced an 88% increase for the year so far, positioning it as the world's best-performing major market. The surge in the stock market has been driven by a growing number of individual investors, who are showing a strong interest in participating in the current bull market. This enthusiasm seems to outweigh concerns about potential losses. Government measures, including interest-rate increases, have not effectively curbed the buying momentum. The People's Bank of China raised deposit rates more significantly than lending rates this week, potentially aiming to redirect savings into bank deposits rather than stocks. Despite these measures, many investors in China are continuing to overlook potential market corrections and believe that the rising trend will be sustained. Over a million new investor accounts have been opened this month, and many individuals express a willingness to continue investing even after market declines. Analysts suggest that the government may not have the means to easily slow the market's ascent. Meanwhile, capital-control regulations have limited the effects of the U.S. subprime-mortgage market collapse on China's financial markets. However, Chinese exports may still be affected if U.S. consumer spending declines. Foreign investors primarily access the Chinese market through a quota system that accounts for less than 1% of the total $2.8 trillion market capitalization. In contrast, stocks of Chinese companies listed in overseas markets, like Hong Kong, have shown different valuation levels, often being as much as 50% lower than their Shanghai counterparts. Some investors express expectations that Hong Kong stock prices may rise closer to those in Shanghai, especially following recent policy changes allowing greater access for Chinese investors. In addition to the developments in China, other Asian markets experienced increases. In Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock Average climbed 2.6% to 16316.32, with Pacific Metals rising 13%. Investors in Japan were influenced by the yen's weakening and the Bank of Japan's decision not to raise interest rates. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 2.8% to 22966.97, marking its fourth consecutive day of gains. South Korea's Kospi Index increased by 2.3% to 1799.72, nearly recovering from recent losses.

Raphael Minder reports: [ASIA EDITION]; China's surging coal demand leaves costly queues at Australian port Some doubt that plans for quotas will remove the Newcastle shipping bottleneck. Raphael Minder reports:   [ASIA EDITION ]",
        "original_text": "After 38 years as a skipper, little fazes Dave Rolston, master of one of the six tugboats operating in Newcastle, among Australia's biggest ports and a world leader for coal exports. But on an outing earlier this month Mr Rolston appeared flummoxed by news that the queue of ships waiting to enter the port and load coal had stretched that morning to a record 70 vessels. \"This is by far the worst it's ever been,\" he says. \"We're working as fast as we can but these ships just keep arriving.\" As his tugboat reached a Manila-registered ship a few miles out of the port's heads, the boat's radar screen showed a queue that stretched 40 miles down the coast - two-fifths of the way to Sydney. Newcastle is suffering from one of the most striking examples of the infrastructure bottlenecks that have arisen across Australia because of surging Chinese-led demand for coal and other commodities. The average wait for a ship to load up at Newcastle is now three weeks and delays are costing the coal industry about ADollars 1m (USDollars 786,000, Euros 596,000, Pounds 407,000) a day according to industry estimates, as producers pay so-called demurrage charges to anchor until a berth becomes available. Gloucester Coal, one of the producers affected by the queuing, recently described the situation as \"a disgrace\" that is \"costing Australia money\". To ease the problem, coal producers recently voted to reintroduce quotas, a decision that still needs approval from the Australian competition regulator. But the use of quotas is controversial and has regularly split the big coal companies, leading to a series of policy back-flips. The delays at Newcastle also illustrate the difficulties of timing costly infrastructure developments to coincide with peaks in demand in a cyclical sector such as coal. Meanwhile, Chinese and other coal purchasers have no incentive to stop their ships from waiting in the queue since producers pick up the bill for delays. Unlike many state-controlled ports in emerging markets such as India, which are also facing capacity constraints, Newcastle runs as a private operation with investment decisions in the hands of the coal companies. However, another part of the transport chain, the railway network that links Newcastle to the coal-producing Hunter Valley, remains state-owned, which has led to some mutual recrimination.",
        "debiased_text": "Dave Rolston, who has been a skipper for 38 years and operates one of the six tugboats in Newcastle, Australia, reported earlier this month that the queue of ships waiting to enter the port and load coal had reached a record 70 vessels. He stated that the situation is the worst he has encountered, noting that the ships continue to arrive despite efforts to work as quickly as possible. At the time, the radar of his tugboat showed a queue that extended 40 miles down the coast, approximately two-fifths of the way to Sydney. The port of Newcastle is experiencing significant infrastructure challenges due to increased demand for coal and other commodities, largely driven by China. The average waiting time for a ship to load coal at Newcastle is currently three weeks, and industry estimates suggest that daily delays are costing the coal industry approximately ADollars 1m (USDollars 786,000, Euros 596,000, Pounds 407,000) in demurrage charges, which are fees paid by producers for keeping ships anchored until a berth is available. Gloucester Coal, one of the coal producers affected, described the situation as \"a disgrace\" that is costing Australia money. In an effort to address the issue, coal producers have recently decided to reintroduce quotas, although this proposal still requires approval from the Australian competition regulator. The implementation of quotas has been controversial and has historically led to disagreements among major coal companies, resulting in inconsistent policy changes. The delays in Newcastle also highlight the challenges of aligning expensive infrastructure development with periods of peak demand in a cyclical industry such as coal. Chinese and other coal buyers have no incentive to reduce their presence in the queue, as the producers bear the cost of delays. In contrast to state-controlled ports in other countries, such as India, which also face similar capacity issues, Newcastle operates as a private port, with investment decisions controlled by the coal companies. However, the railway network connecting the port to the Hunter Valley coal-producing region is state-owned, which has resulted in some disputes between the entities involved."

        "original_text": "Chevron, the US oil and gas company that angered Beijing by winning a bruising takeover battle for Unocal against Chinese competition, yesterday signed China's largest onshore natural gas joint venture involving a foreign partner. The 30-year deal to develop and operate a gas field in western China in co-operation with China National Petroleum Corp, underlines Beijing's pragmatic approach to exploiting the resources needed for its fast-growing economy. Chevron annoyed Beijing during a 2005 takeover battle with CNOOC, China's state-owned offshore oil enterprise, which saw the California group gain control of Unocal, a US energy company. CNPC will retain a majority 51 per cent interest in the field and will be responsible for marketing the gas. Chevron will have 49 per cent. Chevron said that its skills and proven technology in exploiting sour gas fields, similar to the one in question in Sichuan, were the key to winning the tender. \"We have a long history in developing complex and complicated oil and gas projects around the world,\" said Isikeli Taureka, Chevron's manager for China, ahead of the signing ceremony in Beijing yesterday. Sour gas, which contains significant amounts of hydrogen sulphide, requires special handling equipment, drilling and production technology to ensure safe operations, he said. CNPC's reputation was marred by a huge accident at one of its gas fields near Chongqing, in December 2003, when an explosion killed 243 people and poisoned more than 4,000 others. The Chevron executives did not draw a direct link between this accident and the central government's decision to allow foreign companies to bid to operate the Sichuan Chuandongbei field. But they said that safety had been an issue for the central government in the tender. The field has proven reserves of 5,000bn cu ft of gas, although further drilling in the 2,000 sq km area could yield more. The Chinese venture is a big addition to Chevron's energy assets in the region. \"We are looking at building a world-scale, high-impact natural gas business throughout the whole of Asia-Pacific,\" said Steve Green, a Chevron managing director in Asia. He said 20 per cent, or Dollars 4bn, of Chevron's capital expenditure for this year had been earmarked for the region. The group said it was too early to say what the development costs of the field would be.",

        "original_text": "Almost six months after implementation, the U.S. government's attempt to slow the import of cheap coated paper from China has worked -- somewhat. The government's first-ever Chinese countervailing tariff, a duty imposed to offset foreign government subsidies, sought to even the playing field for U.S. coated-paper producers, already under pressure amid an industry shift to online advertising. But while there is evidence of slowing imports, figures from U.S. Customs and forest-products-industry research firm RISI Inc. indicate Chinese producers have changed their paper recipe to move it out of the tariff category. \"We haven't really seen any significant change in price or demand for our products,\" said Ann Whalen, senior vice president of marketing and customer service for Appleton Coated LLC, a Kimberly, Wis., maker of coated freesheet owned by French paper group Sequana Capital SA. Ms. Whalen said it appears Chinese producers are exporting a roughly similar volume of coated paper to the U.S. but shipping some of it under a different category. By shipping coated paper that contains at least 10% bleached chemi- thermal mechanical pulp, Chinese producers can classify it as coated mechanical paper rather than coated freesheet, said John Maine, vice president of World Graphic Papers for RISI. Coated mechanical paper is cheaper and of lower quality and contrast than coated freesheet. According to RISI, China shipped 148,000 short tons of coated freesheet and 925 short tons of coated mechanical paper to the U.S. in the first six months of 2006. But in the first half of 2007, coated freesheet imports dropped to 75,000 tons, while coated mechanical imports increased to 41,000 tons. \"[The tariff] has clearly had an impact to some degree, but it has not been as large as originally anticipated,\" Mr. Maine said. Figures from U.S. Customs through July paint an even starker picture, said Paul Leclair, chief economist for the Montreal-based Pulp and Paper Products Council. In all of 2006, China shipped 11,000 tons of coated mechanical paper to the U.S., compared with 256,000 tons of coated freesheet. Through July, China already has shipped up to 61,000 tons of coated mechanical, while coated freesheet shipments were down 62%, Mr. Leclair said. The two largest producers of coated freesheet paper in the U.S. declined to comment specifically on the impact of the tariffs on their businesses. NewPage Corp., a privately held Dayton, Ohio, company that brought the original complaint that led to the tariff, said in a statement that correcting unfair trade practices will create a level playing field. Sappi Ltd., a South African forest-products company with large coated-paper operations in the U.S., said it probably would provide further comment when it reports fourth-quarter results Nov. 8. Neither of the Chinese companies involved in the issue, Shandong Chenming Paper Holdings Ltd. and Asia Pulp & Paper Co. unit Gold East Paper Co., responded to email requests for comment. Substitution like this isn't a surprising trade tactic, said Ivan Easton, professor of forest resources and director of the Center for International Trade in Forest Products at the University of Washington. In 1998, during the decadelong dispute between the U.S. and Canada over softwood-lumber imports, Canadian producers got around the duty for a time by punching a hole in each board, therefore moving it into the so-called value-added category and placing it under another customs code, Mr. Easton said. The U.S. government acted on the China issue after it said that country's economy had developed to the point where it was now possible to quantify the degree to which the Chinese government, in effect, subsidized manufacturers of coated freesheet paper This exposed Chinese companies to U.S. antisubsidy laws for the first time and triggered a change in U.S. policy that has been in place for more than 20 years. China's delegation to the World Trade Organization notified its U.S. counterpart Sept. 14 that it was asking the WTO for consultation on the issue. If the U.S. and China don't reach an agreement in 60 days, China can ask the WTO to set up a panel to settle the dispute. For its part, the U.S. Department of Commerce has scheduled the final phase of its countervailing duty investigation, which will include a hearing Oct. 18. The tariffs imposed range from 10.9% to 20.4%. They also have been imposed, to a lesser degree, on imports from Indonesia and South Korea. International trade issues aside, the coated-paper market in the U.S. is going through a structural transition of its own as more advertising migrates online, said Dennis Ruggles, forest products analyst for Fitch Ratings. Publishers of glossy magazines and catalogs are using less coated freesheet paper, and some publishers may even be switching to lower- quality coated mechanical paper to lower their costs, he said. \"As long as we have a shift in mediums for communication to electronic from print, the decline is going to continue,\" Mr. Ruggles said. This structural shift finally began triggering coated-machine curtailments in North America mid-year, said Mr. Maine of RISI. \"There was a very rapid shift in the whole market in June, when three capacity closures were announced over a short period of time,\" Mr. Maine said. Those curtailments appear to have had an impact on pricing. Pulp & Paper Week reported that coated-paper prices increased an average of $5 to $15 per ton in September, J.P. Morgan analyst Claudia Shank wrote in a recent report. \"We view these increases as important for both coated and uncoated freesheet, given recent substitution trends,\" she said. If prices for coated papers dip, some coated-paper producers can easily turn off their coaters and switch to uncoated freesheet, making the market more competitive for such uncoated players as Domtar Corp. and International Paper Co., said Steven Chercover, an analyst with D.A. Davidson & Co.",
        "debiased_text": "Almost six months after implementation, the U.S. government's effort to reduce the import of coated paper from China has shown some effects. The first countervailing tariff imposed by the government against Chinese imports aims to counter foreign government subsidies and create a fairer market for U.S. coated paper producers, who are experiencing pressure due to a shift in the advertising industry toward online platforms. Evidence suggests a reduction in imports, but data from U.S. Customs and RISI Inc., a research firm specializing in forest products, indicates that Chinese producers have adjusted their paper production to avoid the tariff category. According to Ann Whalen, senior vice president of marketing and customer service for Appleton Coated LLC, a U.S. company based in Kimberly, Wis., and owned by French paper group Sequana Capital SA, there has not been a significant change in price or demand for their products. Ms. Whalen noted that Chinese producers may be exporting similar volumes of coated paper to the U.S. but under a different classification. John Maine, vice president of World Graphic Papers for RISI, explained that by including at least 10% bleached chemi-thermal mechanical pulp in the coated paper, it can be classified as coated mechanical paper instead of coated freesheet. Coated mechanical paper is less expensive and of lower quality and contrast compared to coated freesheet. Data from RISI shows that in the first six months of 2006, China exported 148,000 short tons of coated freesheet and 925 short tons of coated mechanical paper to the U.S. By the first half of 2007, coated freesheet imports had dropped to 75,000 tons, while coated mechanical imports increased to 41,000 tons. Paul Leclair, chief economist for the Montreal-based Pulp and Paper Products Council, stated that through July 2007, China had already exported up to 61,000 tons of coated mechanical paper, with coated freesheet shipments experiencing a 62% decline compared to 2006. NewPage Corp., a private company from Dayton, Ohio, which initiated the complaint that led to the tariff, stated in a statement that enforcing fair trade practices would help establish a level playing field. Sappi Ltd., a South African forest-products company with significant coated-paper operations in the U.S., indicated it would provide further comment on the tariff's impact when it reports fourth-quarter results on Nov. 8. Neither of the two Chinese companies mentioned in the issue, Shandong Chenming Paper Holdings Ltd. and Gold East Paper Co., a unit of Asia Pulp & Paper Co., responded to requests for comment. Professor Ivan Easton from the University of Washington noted that substitution strategies like this are common in international trade. He cited a similar scenario during the U.S.-Canada softwood lumber dispute in the late 1990s, where Canadian producers avoided tariffs by altering the product's form to qualify for a different customs classification. The U.S. government initiated the tariff investigation after determining that China's economic development allowed for the quantification of government subsidies provided to coated freesheet paper manufacturers. This situation brought Chinese companies under U.S. antisubsidy laws for the first time, prompting a policy change that has been in effect for more than 20 years. China's delegation to the World Trade Organization (WTO) informed the U.S. on Sept. 14 of its intent to request consultation on the tariff. If an agreement is not reached within 60 days, China has the right to request the establishment of a WTO panel to resolve the dispute. The U.S. Department of Commerce has scheduled the final phase of its countervailing duty investigation, which will include a hearing on Oct. 18. The tariffs range from 10.9% to 20.4% and have also been applied, to a lesser extent, on imports from Indonesia and South Korea. According to Dennis Ruggles, a forest products analyst with Fitch Ratings, the U.S. coated paper market is undergoing a structural shift as more advertising moves online. Publishers of glossy magazines and catalogs are using less coated freesheet paper, with some possibly turning to coated mechanical paper to reduce costs. Mr. Ruggles remarked that the shift from print to electronic media will likely continue to drive the decline in coated paper demand. Mr. Maine of RISI noted that this transition began to affect coated paper production in North America mid-year, with three capacity closures announced in June. These closures may have influenced pricing, as reported by Pulp & Paper Week, which indicated an average increase of $5 to $15 per ton in coated paper prices in September. Claudia Shank, a J.P. Morgan analyst, mentioned in a recent report that these price increases are significant for both coated and uncoated freesheet paper. Steven Chercover, an analyst with D.A. Davidson & Co., noted that declining prices for coated paper could lead producers to halt coating operations and switch to uncoated freesheet paper, which may increase competition among uncoated players such as Domtar Corp. and International Paper Co."

        "original_text": "Text of report in English by Taiwanese Central News Agency website [By Flor Wang] Taipei, May 30 (CNA) - In response to Beijing's criticism of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's decision to draft a resolution on making Taiwan a normal country, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Wednesday that it is Beijing's \"obstinate\" mindset that has pushed the Taiwan people away from China. The MAC made the comments in a statement after China's Central Office for Taiwan Affairs under the State Council attacked the DPP's \"normal country\" draft as \"a risky monologue heralding Taiwan independence\" earlier that same day. Taiwan is an independent sovereign state whose fate should be determined by its people and this is the consensus among the Taiwan people at the present stage, the MAC said, adding that positive and mutually beneficial cross-Taiwan Strait relations must be built upon that consensus. The Beijing regime has always turned a blind eye to the reality of separate rule on Taiwan and in China and totally disregards Taiwan's strong desire for democracy, the MAC said, adding that Beijing's obstinacy is the prime reason behind the increased alienation between the people on the two sides. The MAC urged Beijing to remove politically charged barriers in bilateral negotiations and to respond positively to Taiwan's overtures as soon as possible on issues of mutual concern, such as allowing Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan. Despite Beijing's verbal attacks, DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung said the party's drafting of a resolution aimed at making Taiwan a normal country will not be hobbled. \"In turn, the party will launch a campaign with all-out efforts to promote the concept among the public, \" he said, adding that \"Beijing's attempts to disrupt the DPP's task has underscored the significance that the resolution carries for the country in seeking to solidify its democratization.\" Lai I-chung, director of the DPP's China Affairs Department, accused Beijing of lacking \"class\" over its opposition to the normal country resolution. Lai issued a condemnation of Beijing, describing it as being \"deliberately provocative\" by making the attacks. A DPP ad hoc group in charge of the drafting held its first meeting earlier that day and is slated to wrap up the task in late July before party delegates vote on it in the party congress scheduled for August.

        "title": "China Can Do More on Darfur; China Can Do More on Darfur",
        "original_text": "As Khartoum's largest and closest business partner, China has provoked outrage from the international community for underwriting genocide in Darfur. In recent months, Beijing has responded with steadily increasing talk about its commitment to promoting peace in the region. But it has taken no meaningful action. Beijing apparently has two strategies. The first is to preserve its alliance with Sudan in order to meet its massive oil needs. The second is to fashion its brand new image -- one that befits the host of the 2008 Olympic games. The two are inconsistent. Genocide Sudanese style is expensive. It requires the purchase of bombers, attack helicopters and a steady flow of arms and ammunition for their proxy killers, the Janjaweed militia. It is no longer a secret that some 70% of Sudan's Chinese oil revenues, which now top $1 billion per year, have been used by the Khartoum government to attack the non-Arab population in the remote Darfur region. Under intense international pressure, China for the first time did not abstain from signing on to the newest United Nations Resolution to provide a protection force for Darfur. But scrutiny of the various incarnations of U.N. Resolution 1769 reveals that China signed only after removing some of its sharpest teeth: The resolution has no mandate to disarm the Janjaweed, and no provision to protect Darfur's borders in eastern Chad and the Central African Republic. The Darfur spillover is threatening to topple both impoverished and unstable countries. Although China has made numerous glib statements in support of the proposed peacekeeping force, the force's command, capabilities and composition effectively remain in the hands of the Sudanese regime. China, a veto-wielding member of the Security Council, has rejected imposing any form of sanctions on its Sudanese partners, thereby allowing Khartoum to continue its campaign of destruction with impunity. Furthermore, Beijing has refused to commit to an arms embargo even in the face of documented and increasingly publicized evidence that Chinese arms shipments to Sudan are destined for Darfur. Despite claims by both the Chinese and the government of Sudan that the situation in Darfur has improved, the U.N. and humanitarian organizations on the ground present a very different picture: Security is rapidly declining, and the threat of humanitarian organizations withdrawing grows by the day. On Sept. 24, Oxfam announced that it is on the threshold of pulling out personnel due to worsening security. This week, escalating violence in the region caused World Vision, a New York-based aid group, to cut its team by two-thirds. World Vision had been feeding 500,000 people. Many camps are so unsafe that humanitarian work is grinding to a halt. Attacks on aid workers rose 150% in the last year. An unprecedented one million vulnerable civilians are currently outside of humanitarian reach. UNICEF reports that in several camps 30% of the population is suffering from acute malnutrition. Meanwhile, aerial attacks on civilians continue, according to an Amnesty International report of Aug. 24, 2007. Just this week in north Darfur, a breakaway faction of the rebel groups JEM and SLA Unity attacked the African Union base in Haskanita, killing at least 10 peacekeepers. Dozens are reported missing. The attack was strongly condemned by Suleiman Jamous, the most respected elder statesman among the rebels in Darfur. \"As rebels, we are losing the sympathy of the international community because of lack of control and divisions within the movements,\" said Mr. Jamous, a leading figure in the original Darfur rebel movement, the Sudan Liberation Army. \"People are frustrated that the African Union is not able to protect them.\" This latest horror underscores the urgent need for a rapid deployment of well-trained, well-supplied troops and fully qualified civilian police. Ironically, however, it is likely to make it more difficult for the U.N. to assemble the necessary peacekeepers. What better time for China to step up and change its image? In the face of mounting criticism of its support of brutal repression and cultural destruction in Burma and Tibet, Darfur represents an opportunity for Beijing to create a positive impression -- and desperately needed favorable PR in anticipation of the 2008 Olympic games. The Chinese have hired more than one prestigious international public-relations firm to clean up their image. But the words they are churning out about Darfur are, at this point, simply that. The undeniable fact remains that China continues to underwrite genocide and the immeasurable suffering of millions of human beings in the Darfur region of Sudan. If Beijing elected to act rather than talk, there is plenty it could do. It could refuse to sell weapons to Sudan. It could insist that the Janjaweed be disarmed. It could demand that the regime stop bombing civilians. It could suspend new oil deals with Khartoum until there is security in Darfur. Even the threat of such actions would have an immediate effect. The world should urge China to apply its unique and powerful leverage to bring an end to this continuing nightmare in Darfur and make its Olympic slogan -- \"One world, one dream\" -- a reality. --- Ms. Farrow, an actress, has just returned from her seventh trip into the Darfur region.",
        "debiased_text": "China, as Sudan's largest and closest business partner, has been accused by some international observers of supporting actions in Darfur that could be considered genocide. In recent months, Beijing has expressed increasing commitment to promoting peace in the region. However, critics assert that China has not taken any substantial measures to address the situation. According to available information, China's strategies appear to focus on preserving its alliance with Sudan to meet its significant oil requirements and on cultivating a positive international image in preparation for hosting the 2008 Olympic Games. These strategies are described as being inconsistent by some analysts. Reports indicate that a portion of Sudan's oil revenues, which are now over $1 billion per year, has been used to support attacks in Darfur, particularly against non-Arab populations. Under international pressure, China signed a new United Nations Resolution to provide a protection force for Darfur for the first time. However, some claim that the resolution's effectiveness was diminished because it did not include provisions to disarm the Janjaweed militia or protect Darfur's borders with eastern Chad and the Central African Republic. The situation in Darfur remains unstable, with international humanitarian organizations expressing concerns about worsening security and the threat of withdrawing from the region. On Sept. 24, Oxfam stated it was on the verge of pulling out its personnel due to deteriorating conditions. Recently, World Vision, an aid organization based in New York, reduced its team by two-thirds, impacting its ability to assist 500,000 people. Attacks on aid workers have increased by 150% in the previous year. According to some reports, over one million civilians are currently beyond the reach of humanitarian aid, and UNICEF has documented cases of acute malnutrition affecting 30% of the population in certain camps.

He noted frustration with the African Union's inability to protect civilians. There have been calls for the rapid deployment of well-trained and adequately equipped troops and civilian police to address the ongoing instability. Some suggest that China could use its influence as a Security Council member to help resolve the situation, such as by halting arms sales to Sudan, insisting on disarming the Janjaweed, or suspending new oil deals until there is improved security in the region. These actions, according to some, could have an immediate impact. Ms. Farrow, an actress who recently returned from her seventh visit to Darfur, has highlighted the need for China to act decisively in contrast to its current rhetoric."

        "title": "Politics & Economics: Nanking Efforts Examine Massacre, Seek Healing; Films, Plays Aim To Engage China, Japan in Dialogue; Politics & Economics: Nanking Efforts Examine Massacre, Seek Healing; Films, Plays Aim To Engage China, Japan in Dialogue",
        "original_text": "NANJING, CHINA -- As China prepares to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the massacre by Japanese troops known as the Rape of Nanking, some Chinese are taking it upon themselves to heal old wounds where their governments have failed. Movie makers are investing millions of dollars in projects, hoping to engage Japanese and even Western audiences in accounts of the December 1937 tragedy, in which the Japanese imperial army stormed what was then China's capital and slayed hundreds of thousands of residents. At an auditorium at Nanjing University -- the city has changed its name -- a more modest production is taking place. English Professor Liu Haiping worked for more than a year to recreate the event onstage, with a cast of nine Chinese and Japanese students. The Sino-Japanese War remains so sensitive that plainclothes police dispatched by the university sat in the audience on opening night, prepared for any unrest. \"The school is very worried that the students might act emotional [and start a riot] afterwards,\" Mr. Liu said. He called the production a \"high-risk\" venture. In the absence of government-level concord, Chinese cultural groups said they want to muster some goodwill using soft diplomacy. China and Japan's governments have failed to agree on such basic issues about the Rape of Nanking as whether Japan has apologized in a manner China finds acceptable, and what was the exact civilian death toll, a complicated matter because the executions began under the pretext of killing soldiers in civilian guise. China puts the civilian toll at 300,000, while the Japanese government has approved textbooks that cite estimates of \"over 200,000\" deaths, including 70,000 to 80,000 civilians. In spring 2005, anti-Japan protests over the textbooks erupted in several Chinese cities. The memory of the massacre and Japan's failure to satisfy demands for an apology have become a rallying point for expressions of Chinese nationalism, which the Beijing government may be reluctant to stifle. Keeping the peace has benefits for both sides. Japan's top trading partner is China, and China is Japan's No. 3 after the European Union and the U.S. There are 125,000 Japanese expatriates in China, mostly working in Japanese companies. In Japan, a range of views on the war and the massacre -- although for more than a decade Japanese prime ministers have said the war was one of aggression for which they are sorry. In March, a group of 20 academics formed the Japan-China Joint History Research Committee to address contentious historical issues. Yet according to Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at the Japan campus of Temple University, the committee pits state-backed Chinese academics against \"revisionist\" Japanese with little sympathy for China's view of the war, so \"there is no chance in the world they are going to compromise.\" Japanese committee chairman Shinichi Kitaoka, calling Mr. Kingston's charge of revisionism \"nonsense,\" acknowledges \"the fact that the war is a tragedy.\" But Mr. Kitaoka said he would like the Chinese to \"stop looking at history where relations were most awful.\" \"If we can come to a point where we can agree to disagree, then it's a kind of success,\" he said. Meanwhile, cultural efforts continue. Some projects have aimed to bring people from both countries together, while others simply want to put a spotlight on the war and force discussion about it. In any case, with at least four major film projects in the works, a broad audience will be exposed to the history of the incident. Last month, Hua Xia Films, China's second largest movie distributor, screened the documentary \"Nanking\" across the country. Written and directed by American Bill Guttentag, an Academy award winner, and based on Iris Chang's book \"The Rape of Nanking,\" the movie was released to mark the first day Japanese soldiers invaded China in 1937. The story centers on interviews with the survivors and Japanese soldiers. When the film was screened in Nanjing last month, at least two cinemas cut ticket prices by 60% to encourage more people to watch it, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Ms. Chang's own life, which ended with her suicide in 2004, will be recounted in a Canadian-funded docudrama scheduled for screening later this year to commemorate the killings and the 10th anniversary of her book's publication. Hong Kong art-house director Yim Ho's \"Nanking Christmas 1937\" will be filmed in Nanjing by the end of the year, Mr. Yim said. He said he waited four years for the Chinese government to approve his project, which they did in March. Endeavor Independent, part of California-based Endeavor Talent Agency, is helping to arrange financing for Mr. Yim's project, estimated to cost $35 million, according to Graham Taylor, head of Endeavor Independent. Mr. Yim said he hopes the Japanese government will allow the film to be shown there. \"This isn't a political film aimed at taking vengeance,\" he said. Separately, in the city of Changchun in northeastern Jilin province, a film crew is recreating the massacre on a 165-acre set for a movie called \"Nanking! Nanking!\" Already, $10 million has been invested, some of it from the provincial government, said director Lu Chuan. At least two war-themed theater productions this year have banded Japanese and Chinese actors together. In March, the Hong Kong Arts Festival cast professional actors from Beijing and Tokyo in a play that, though couched in an allegory about the construction of a Japanese factory in China, alluded to the war. The play was co-written by Chinese director Li Liuyi and Japanese director Oriza Hirata, neither of whom speaks the other's language. Initially, both men clashed. They fought over how explicitly the actors should refer to World War II. Mr. Li wanted straight facts, but Mr. Hirata preferred subtle hints about Japan's role in it. In the end, Mr. Li gave in, removing any direct mentions of the war. \"For me, this project wasn't about politics,\" he said. At Nanjing University, Mr. Liu's student production also faced strong initial resistance. For his young actors, Mr. Liu had picked an obscure Japanese play set in Nanjing that ended with a Japanese character apologizing for the death of a Chinese. That script shocked the play's student director, Michiyo Oi. The script \"was too much for me. It's a clear apology from the Japanese side\" for the war, she said. Ms. Oi said her mother at first worried about her daughter's safety. She feared Ms. Oi might get lynched in Nanjing just for being Japanese. But Ms. Oi said her mother cried with joy when the production later came to Tokyo, filled with pride that her daughter had taken part in a project that drew two rival countries together. Ms. Oi, who in junior high school used a textbook that contained only one line about the Nanking massacre, said she took on the project to decide for herself whether the event had been exaggerated or even fabricated. She spent a week interviewing Chinese victims in Nanking, hoping to find ideas for an alternative script that eventually relegated the war to the background and focused on young Chinese and Japanese meeting for the first time in China. Her experience has been filmed for a documentary that will be released in English, Chinese and Japanese this year, with funding from the Japan International Christian University, where she graduated. The Japan ICU and Nanjing University plan to get their students to write about World War II in an essay contest. Another Sino-Japanese play is in the pipeline, Mr. Liu said. At the end of opening night, the audience at Nanjing University applauded, even for the Japanese actors. Now \"we just want to keep the momentum going,\" he said. --- Sue Feng in Beijing and Sebastian Moffett in Tokyo contributed to this article. --- Corrections & Amplifications The rendering in Roman characters of the name of the Chinese city of Nanjing was changed from Nanking after China adopted a new Romanization system following the Communist Party's rise to power in 1949. A Politics & Economics article Monday about the anniversary of the Rape of Nanking incorrectly implied the city's Chinese name was changed. (WSJ Aug. 17, 2007)",
        "debiased_text": "NANJING, CHINA -- In preparation for the 70th anniversary of the massacre by Japanese troops known as the Rape of Nanking, some individuals in China are taking independent efforts to address the historical event. Movie makers are investing in various projects to bring attention to the December 1937 event, in which the Japanese imperial army invaded what was then China's capital and resulted in the deaths of a large number of residents. At Nanjing University, an English professor, Liu Haiping, spent over a year working on a theatrical performance involving nine students from both China and Japan, aiming to recreate the event on stage. Due to the sensitivity of the topic, plainclothes university police attended the opening night performance to monitor for any possible disturbances. Liu Haiping noted that the university was concerned about potential emotional reactions from the audience.\n\nThe governments of China and Japan have not reached consensus on certain details of the Rape of Nanking, including whether Japan's apology is acceptable to China and the exact number of civilian deaths. China estimates the civilian toll to be 300,000, while the Japanese government has endorsed textbooks that cite an estimate of over 200,000, including 70,000 to 80,000 civilians. In 2005, anti-Japan protests due to these textbooks occurred in several Chinese cities. The issue of the massacre and Japan's lack of a fully accepted apology has become a significant point for expressing nationalism in China, which the Beijing government may be cautious about addressing openly.\n\nMaintaining peace has mutual benefits for both countries. China is Japan's top trading partner, and Japan ranks third after the European Union and the U.S. in China's trade relations. There are approximately 125,000 Japanese expatriates in China, mostly employed by Japanese companies. Japanese prime ministers have generally expressed sorrow for the aggressive war for over a decade. In March, a group of 20 academics established the Japan-China Joint History Research Committee to address controversial historical issues.\n\nAccording to Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at the Japan campus of Temple University, the committee includes state-supported Chinese academics and Japanese individuals with differing perspectives, which he suggests limits the opportunity for compromise. Japanese committee chairman Shinichi Kitaoka dismisses the accusation of revisionism, stating that the war was a tragedy and expressing the desire for both nations to 'agree to disagree' as a form of success.\n\nCultural projects continue to be developed. Some aim to bring together individuals from both countries, while others focus on raising awareness and encouraging discussions about the war. With at least four major film projects underway, a large audience is expected to be exposed to the historical context of these events. Recently, Hua Xia Films, China's second-largest movie distributor, screened the documentary 'Nanking,' directed by American Bill Guttentag, based on Iris Chang's book 'The Rape of Nanking.' The film was released to commemorate the first day of the Japanese invasion in 1937. The story features interviews with survivors and Japanese soldiers. Last month, at least two cinemas in Nanjing reduced ticket prices by 60% in an effort to encourage greater attendance, as reported by the state-run Xinhua news agency.\n\nA Canadian-funded docudrama recounting Iris Chang's life, including her suicide in 2004, is scheduled for later this year to mark the 10th anniversary of her book's publication. Hong Kong director Yim Ho is preparing a film titled 'Nanking Christmas 1937' to be shot in Nanjing by the end of the year. Yim stated that he had to wait four years for government approval, which was finally granted in March. The film, estimated to cost $35 million, is being financed by Endeavor Independent, a division of the California-based Endeavor Talent Agency. Yim hopes for the film's approval and screening in Japan. He emphasized that the film is not aimed at seeking revenge but rather at bringing attention to the historical event.\n\nIn addition, a different film crew is recreating the massacre on a 165-acre set in the city of Changchun, in northeastern Jilin province, for a movie called 'Nanking! Nanking!' The project, which has received $10 million in funding, including some from the provincial government, is directed by Lu Chuan.\n\nAt least two theater productions highlighting Japanese and Chinese actors working together have taken place this year. In March, the Hong Kong Arts Festival featured a play with actors from Beijing and Tokyo that, while framed as an allegory about the construction of a Japanese factory in China, touched upon the war. The play was co-written by Chinese director Li Liuyi and Japanese director Oriza Hirata. Originally, the two had conflicting ideas on how explicit the mentions of World War II should be in the performance. Li wanted to present factual references, while Hirata preferred subtler allusions. In the end, Li modified the script to avoid direct references to World War II. Li emphasized his commitment to non-political objectives in the project.\n\nLiu Haiping's student production at Nanjing University also encountered resistance. Liu came across an obscure Japanese play set in Nanjing, which ended with a Japanese character apologizing for the death of a Chinese character. This script was met with initial concerns from the student director, Michiyo Oi, who felt it was too strong an apology. Oi noted her mother was initially worried about her safety, fearing retaliation against her as a Japanese individual in Nanjing. However, her mother later expressed pride when the production was presented in Tokyo.\n\nOi, who in junior high used a textbook that only mentioned the Nanking massacre briefly, participated in the project to personally assess whether the event was exaggerated or fabricated. She spent a week interviewing Chinese victims in Nanking and eventually crafted a script that shifted the focus to interactions between young Chinese and Japanese individuals in China. The experience was documented in a film that will be released in English, Chinese, and Japanese this year, funded by the Japan International Christian University, where Oi graduated. The Japan ICU and Nanjing University also planned an essay contest for students on the topic of World War II.\n\nAnother Sino-Japanese play is in the works, according to Liu. At the end of the opening night, the audience at Nanjing University applauded the performance, including for the Japanese actors. Liu expressed the desire for the momentum from this project to continue."

        "original_text": "BEIJING -- In a time when big Western oil and natural-gas companies are spending billions of dollars on projects around the globe, Transmeridian Exploration Inc. might escape notice. The small Houston oil company, which trades on the American Stock Exchange, last year posted $24.7 million in revenue and has yet to show a profit. But thanks to its holdings in oil-rich and strategically important Kazakhstan, Transmeridian is attracting attention from Chinese energy companies. China's Zhenhua Oil -- whose parent company is an arms maker against which the U.S. has issued sanctions -- and Cnooc Ltd. have signaled to China's National Development and Reform Commission their interest in bidding for Transmeridian, people familiar with the matter said. It is unclear whether the interest will result in a bid. Transmeridian Chief Financial Officer Earl McNeil declined to comment. China's oil consumption is growing rapidly, and stagnant domestic crude output has prompted its state oil companies to seek access to overseas reserves through acquisitions. But Beijing's economic and political clout has intensified concerns in the West that the second- largest energy consumer is using its state companies to lock in resources at the expense of the energy security of Western countries. Cnooc withdrew its $18.5 billion offer for California's Unocal Corp. in 2005 after encountering a critical storm in U.S. Congress, clearing the way for a lower bid from Chevron Corp. to win the auction. In part as a response to that, China's oil companies have focused on smaller deals, often with less-prominent Western companies that are less likely to draw political fire. China's Citic Group last year agreed to acquire the Kazakh assets of Canada's Nations Energy Co. for $1.91 billion. Two years ago, China National Petroleum Corp. paid $4.18 billion for PetroKazakhstan, a Canadian oil company whose main asset was a field in Kazakhstan. This year, CNPC, the state-owned parent of PetroChina Co., bought rights to fields in Canada with a view to exploring and developing the technically challenging oil sands there. \"Transmeridian's oil assets in Kazakhstan are extremely interesting because there aren't many oil assets available in the market at present. That's why Chinese companies are prepared to battle each other for them,\" said an official at one of the Chinese companies weighing a bid. That leaves them circling companies outside the oil-patch establishment that often have shallow financial resources, thinly traded shares or lack a track record in developing new resources. Transmeridian has a 100% interest in CaspiNeft, which holds the license to the South Alibek field in western Kazakhstan. The field had total proved reserves of 67.2 million barrels of oil at the end of 2006. On its Web site, Transmeridian valued the field at $970 million. But the company and the property face challenges. Transmeridian has been selling its oil at well below world-market prices. Last year, when light, sweet crude was trading at roughly $60 to $70 a barrel, the company's crude fetched an average price of about $34 a barrel. In its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company blamed its need to ship oil via rail or sell oil direct from the field, and said it started to export oil via pipeline on better terms this year. The company is also working under a significant amount of debt. It has about $268 million in long-term debt due in 2010, according to its annual SEC filing, stemming mostly from privately sold debt that it says carries restrictions on whether it can sell assets or make other corporate moves. Another SEC filing this month showed that Transmeridian had a net working capital deficit of $15.6 million at the end of June. Last year, it reported a net loss of $53.2 million. Its volatile shares have lost most of their value so far this year, and at 4 p.m. yesterday were trading at $1.87, compared with a 52-week high of $5.18 reached Aug. 31, 2006. It has a market capitalization of $189 million. Its capital structure includes convertible preferred stock that could significantly add to shares outstanding. Despite the numbers, speculation has swirled in Asia, where both China and India are looking for deals to add to oil reserves. In July, the chairman of India's Oil & Natural Gas Corp., R.S. Sharma, declined to confirm media reports that its ONGC Videsh Ltd. unit was interested in Transmeridian. Transmeridian effectively put itself up for sale in April when it announced a strategic review of its assets while retaining Jefferies Randall & Dewey, a unit of Jefferies & Co., as its financial adviser. Jefferies declined to comment. Disclosing the decision to evaluate the company's strategic alternatives in April, Transmeridian President and Chief Executive Lorrie Olivier said it was because \"the current market value of our common stock does not adequately reflect the value of the company's investment in the South Alibek field.\" Chinese interest is likely to be stimulated by strategic needs, given the proximity of Kazakhstan to China and the likelihood that a 470-mile missing link in the Central Asian country's pipeline network from Kenkiyak to Kumkol will be built so it can connect with an existing cross-border crude pipeline to China. China's interest in Kazakhstan has spurred a political response there, in a time when oil-rich nations are taking a greater say in the ownership and terms of developing reserves within their borders. China's recent deals there spurred the Kazakh government to change the law to allow it to step into any deal concerning the transfer and sale of assets involved in mineral production, with state oil company KazMunaiGaz usually taking as much as 50% of the assets. It is unlikely that China's oil companies would go head-to-head in bidding for Transmeridian. The National Development and Reform Commission, China's economic-planning agency, discourages domestic companies from competing for foreign assets, because it drives asset prices up and exposes the companies to the risk of overpaying. Transmeridian has said proposals for its acquisition are expected in early September. Zhenhua, a state-owned oil trader that already has some assets in Kazakhstan, lodged its interest with the NDRC before Chinese rivals, although the NDRC has asked it to work with its rivals to construct a bid consortium, the people said. Zhenhua is an oil trader whose parent is state-owned arms maker China North Industries Group Co., known as Norinco, a major supplier to the People's Liberation Army of China. Norinco had sanctions imposed on it twice in 2003 by the U.S. government for allegedly selling missile technology to Iran. Norinco says the sanctions are \"unreasonable.\" --- Renya Peng in Beijing and John M. Biers in Houston contributed to this article. Enlarge this image.",
        "debiased_text": "BEIJING -- Transmeridian Exploration Inc., a small Houston-based oil company that trades on the American Stock Exchange, reported $24.7 million in revenue last year and has not yet achieved profitability. However, due to its holdings in oil-rich Kazakhstan, the company is drawing interest from Chinese energy firms. Zhenhua Oil, whose parent company is an arms manufacturer that has faced U.S. sanctions, and Cnooc Ltd., have indicated their interest in bidding for Transmeridian to the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), according to individuals familiar with the situation. It is uncertain whether this interest will lead to a formal bid. Transmeridian's Chief Financial Officer, Earl McNeil, did not comment on the issue.\n\nChina's oil consumption is increasing, while domestic crude output remains stagnant, prompting state oil companies to seek access to overseas reserves through acquisitions. This has raised concerns in the West, as China's economic and political influence grows, potentially affecting global energy security. In 2005, Cnooc withdrew its $18.5 billion bid for Unocal Corp. after facing significant opposition in the U.S. Congress, which allowed Chevron Corp. to secure the company at a lower price. As a result, Chinese oil companies have increasingly focused on smaller deals with less prominent Western firms that are less likely to attract political scrutiny.\n\nLast year, China's Citic Group acquired the Kazakh assets of Canada's Nations Energy Co. for $1.91 billion.

This year, CNPC, the state-owned parent of PetroChina Co., secured rights to fields in Canada for exploration and development of oil sands.\n\nA representative from a Chinese company considering a bid noted that Transmeridian's oil assets in Kazakhstan are of interest due to limited availability of such assets in the market. This has led to competition among Chinese firms for these assets. Transmeridian holds a 100% interest in CaspiNeft, which possesses the license for the South Alibek field in western Kazakhstan. The field had total proved reserves of 67.2 million barrels of oil at the end of 2006. According to the company's website, the field was valued at $970 million.\n\nThe company and its property face several challenges. Transmeridian has sold its oil at prices significantly lower than global market rates. During the previous year, when light, sweet crude was priced at approximately $60 to $70 per barrel, the company's crude was sold at an average of about $34 per barrel. In filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company attributed this to the need to transport oil via rail or sell it directly from the field. It has begun exporting oil via pipeline on more favorable terms this year. The company is also dealing with significant debt, with about $268 million in long-term debt due in 2010, primarily resulting from privately issued debt with restrictions on asset sales or other corporate activities. A recent SEC filing indicated that Transmeridian had a net working capital deficit of $15.6 million as of the end of June. The company also reported a net loss of $53.2 million last year. Transmeridian's shares have experienced a decline in value this year, trading at $1.87 as of 4 p.m. yesterday, compared to a 52-week high of $5.18 recorded on August 31, 2006. It currently has a market capitalization of $189 million. The company's capital structure includes convertible preferred stock, which may increase the number of shares outstanding.\n\nDespite these financial figures, interest in Transmeridian has been noted in Asia, where both China and India are seeking opportunities to expand their oil reserves. In July, R.S. Sharma, the chairman of India's Oil & Natural Gas Corp., did not confirm media reports suggesting that its ONGC Videsh Ltd. subsidiary was interested in Transmeridian.\n\nIn April, Transmeridian effectively put itself up for sale by announcing a strategic review of its assets while retaining Jefferies Randall & Dewey, a division of Jefferies & Co., as its financial advisor. Jefferies did not provide a comment. In its announcement about the strategic review, Transmeridian's President and CEO, Lorrie Olivier, stated that the decision was due to the company's belief that the current market value of its stock does not reflect the true value of its investment in the South Alibek field.\n\nChinese interest in acquiring Transmeridian is likely driven by strategic considerations. The proximity of Kazakhstan to China, and the possibility of constructing a 470-mile pipeline link from Kenkiyak to Kumkol that could connect to an existing cross-border crude pipeline to China, may be factors. China's growing presence in Kazakhstan has prompted a political response, with the Kazakh government adjusting laws to involve itself in any deals regarding the transfer and sale of assets related to mineral production. State oil company KazMunaiGaz has typically claimed up to 50% of such assets.\n\nIt is improbable that Chinese oil companies will directly compete for Transmeridian. The NDRC, China's economic planning agency, advises against such direct competition as it can lead to increased asset prices and the risk of overpaying. Transmeridian has stated that it expects acquisition proposals in early September. Zhenhua Oil, which already has assets in Kazakhstan, expressed its interest to the NDRC prior to other Chinese companies.

        "original_text": "BEIJING -- With China still tightly regulating fuel prices, big oil companies are increasingly looking at the country's surging demand for chemicals. In one of the biggest deals of its kind, Exxon Mobil Corp. Friday signed a deal with Saudi Aramco and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., better known as Sinopec, to expand an oil refinery in China's rich southern province of Fujian. The deal also involves construction of a large chemical facility scheduled for completion by 2009, which executives said was essential to making the broader deal financially attractive. Exxon Mobil and Aramco, the Saudi government oil company, will each own 25% of the $5 billion project, with the rest held by Sinopec and the local government. The figure announced Friday is much higher than an earlier announced figure of $3.5 billion. Company executives declined to explain why the project's cost had risen, but higher costs have been felt across the industry because of rising prices for steel and other materials. The investors will more than triple capacity at the existing oil refinery in Quanzhou to 240,000 barrels of fuel a day. The deal has been under negotiation since 2001, and important approvals were handed down earlier this year. Aramco will provide oil for the project. \"When you look at price controls, refining is a difficult business in China,\" Steve Simon, Exxon Mobil's senior vice president and director in charge of downstream refinery and chemicals, said in an interview. Instead of being dependent solely on fuel sales, the new venture will rely initially on its integration with the huge chemical facility -- which will produce millions of tons a year of different chemicals -- to tap into China's quickly expanding market for chemicals. The project will convert oil into the materials used to make plastics, paints, fibers and other basic chemicals essential to China's surging manufacturing sector. Prices for such chemicals aren't regulated in China. Mr. Simon said that by 2015, about half of global chemical demand will come from Asia, with China by itself accounting for a fourth. Royal Dutch Shell PLC and BP PLC are among the major oil companies already investing in petrochemicals in China. The signing Friday at the Great Hall of the People, China's main building for government meetings, also marked Exxon's first big foray into retail gasoline marketing in China. A separate contract was signed by Sinopec, Exxon Mobil, and Saudi Aramco for a retail joint venture to manage and operate about 750 filling stations and a network of terminals in Fujian. Royal Dutch Shell and France's Total SA have already established limited regional networks of retail gasoline stations in China. Exxon Mobil is looking into alliances with fast-food outlets or convenience stores for the new gas stations, Mr. Simon said. As China grows richer, its middle class is buying cars. Even as the growth in demand for fuel in Japan, Europe and the U.S. tapers off, Exxon expects China's fuel demand to rise at a pace of 4.3% over the next five years, creating an attractive market, Mr. Simon said. But China's refiners have been operating at a loss because of government fuel-price controls. China fears raising fuel prices could spark inflation or lead to social unrest among its poor farmers.",

Yang Chunlin, an unemployed former factory worker from Jiamusi, Heilongjiang province, was accused of accepting money from hostile foreign organisations, writing critical articles, and organising a petition on behalf of farmers who lost their land to developers. The petition, which was circulated last year, declared: \"We don't want the Olympics, we want human rights.\" According to Yang's family, it was signed by 7,000 to 8,000 people. His sister Yang Chunping said the sentence was excessive because of the timing. \"My brother helped farmers asking for land. He might have criticised the party as well as some officials, but all he did is to improve the development of democracy in China. What he said is based on freedom of speech. It is not against the law,\" she said. \"If it were not Olympic year, my brother won't get such a heavy sentence.\" The court passed sentence as the Olympics torch left Athens on its way to Beijing for the games this August. China wants to use the Olympics to highlight how economic development has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, but critics see the event as an opportunity to highlight human rights abuses. Yang is not the first dissident to suffer legal action for speaking out. Hu Jia, a civil rights campaigner, was tried on a subversion charge last week and is awaiting sentence. Last month, democracy activist Lu Gengsong was given four years in jail on the same charge. Others, such as petitioner Liu Jie, have been put into \"education through labour\" camps for speaking out about human rights abuses and land seizures. Yang was accused of receiving 10,000 yuan (£700) from the China Liberal Democracy party, which the communist authorities in Beijing have designated a hostile organisation. The dissident is innocent but will not appeal, according to his lawyer Li Fangping, because he does not want to legitimise what he considers a flawed legal process.",

In Hong Kong's Ladies' Market, a tourist hot spot, the traders of counterfeit luxury products are also feeling the downturn. Mrs Leung, who sells imposter Gucci handbags for HK$120-HK$250 (US$15- US$32) apiece, says business is down 30 per cent from last year. \"November is usually one of our busiest times, when tourists buy Christmas presents. But this year there are fewer of them,\" she said. \"They bargain harder, too.\" In the neighbouring province of Shenzhen, touts selling counterfeit luxury goods are so brazen that they hand out business cards. The calling card of one \"A-ying\", who works the pedestrian walkways near the border with Hong Kong, assures potential customers: \"I'm Sure You'll Be Very Satisfied With The Price and Quality.\" A-ying's job is to lead the potential buyers to a small store on the third floor of Luohu Commercial City, guiding them past competing stalls and pedicurists. Once inside, the shopgirls take over. Customers are invited to browse the official catalogues of luxury retailers such as Louis Vuitton and Patek Philippe. After they have identified what they are after, the corresponding fake is produced. A \"Tag Heuer\" watch retails for Rmb900 (US$132), compared with Rmb20,000 for the real deal. A Louis Vuitton \"Monogram Multicolore\" handbag is offered for Rmb700. \"This would cost Rmb8,000 - and it's real leather,\" a sales assistant says, pointing proudly to the \"Made in France\" label.

Mr Mak, who pushed forward the opening of his shop, received a higher-than-expected 80 orders in his first month of business. \"October was a good time to launch, even though we were not totally ready,\" Mr Mak said. \"The financial tsunami gave us a good opportunity as people have become more careful with their money.\" The slowdown in sales at the Ladies' Market seems to support Mr Mak's entrepreneurial hunch that in these troubled times some people would rather rent the real thing than buy the fake.",

She noted that November, typically a busy month for tourist shopping during the Christmas season, saw fewer customers this time. Additionally, she mentioned that customers were more willing to negotiate prices. In the neighboring city of Shenzhen, individuals involved in the sale of counterfeit luxury goods are openly distributing business cards. One such individual, known as 'A-ying,' operates near the border with Hong Kong and provides potential customers with cards stating, 'I'm Sure You'll Be Very Satisfied With The Price and Quality.' A-ying directs buyers to a small store on the third floor of Luohu Commercial City, bypassing other competing stalls and services. Once inside, shop assistants assist customers in reviewing official catalogues from luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Patek Philippe. After identifying a desired item, the corresponding counterfeit product is presented. For example, a counterfeit Tag Heuer watch is sold for Rmb900 (US$132), compared to Rmb20,000 for the authentic version. A Louis Vuitton 'Monogram Multicolore' handbag is offered for Rmb700. A sales assistant mentioned that the genuine product would cost Rmb8,000 and be made of real leather, pointing to the 'Made in France' label on the counterfeit item. In Hong Kong, there is an alternative to counterfeit goods provided by ICONLady, a rental service founded by Jason Mak last month. ICONLady offers legitimate Prada and Miu Miu bags for rent at prices as low as HK$48 per day, which is 1.5 to 2.5 per cent of the retail price. Mr. Mak reported receiving 80 orders in the first month of operation, which was higher than anticipated. He stated that October was chosen as a launch period, despite initial preparations not being fully complete, as the economic situation created an opportunity for consumers to be more cautious with their spending. The reduced sales in the Ladies' Market appear to align with Mr. Mak's observation that in the current economic climate, some individuals may prefer renting authentic luxury items rather than purchasing counterfeit versions."

        "title": "Funding boost for China's military",
        "original_text": "China's military is to receive another hefty budget increase, with a 17.6% rise in funding to beef up its capabilities and ease the lives of more than two million troops, it emerged today. Soldiers will get better training, higher salaries and better meals as spending rises from 350bn yuan (£25bn) to 418bn yuan. But some of the cash will go on hardware, allowing China to conduct a war \"under IT-based conditions\" capacity, Jiang Enzhu, a spokesman for the country's parliament told agency reporters. Speaking before the opening session of the National People's Congress tomorrow, he said the rise was \"moderate\" because it came from a low base, despite a substantial increase last year. The news comes the day after a Pentagon report expressed concerns about the development of China's military, including an apparent rise in cyber-espionage as well as its increased strike capacity and testing of an anti-satellite weapon last year. It argued that the People's Liberation Army was \"pursuing comprehensive transformation from a mass army designed for protracted wars of attrition on its territory to one capable of fighting and winning short-duration wars along its periphery against high-tech adversaries\". It also suggested China's true defence budget was two to three times the official figure last year. That would still leave it well below the United States budget, which has also risen substantially to $623bn (£314bn) for 2008. Jiang told reporters: \"In recent years the Chinese government has moderately increased its spending on national defence on the basis of sustained, steady and fast economic growth and rapid build-up of government revenues. \"These increases were of a compensatory nature to make up for the weak defence foundation.\" Jiang said China's military spending was 1.4% of its gross domestic product last year, compared with 4.6% in the US and 3% in Britain. The budget rise prompted Japan's defence ministry to urge China to enhance transparency and address international concerns. Figures for 2006 from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute suggest China lagged behind the US, UK and France in total spending, but in purchasing power parity was second to the US, spending the equivalent of $188bn to the US's $529bn. Trefor Moss, Asia Pacific editor at Jane's Defence Weekly, said it was hard to know the true scale and nature of the country's military development, but added: \"For a long time China's spending was clearly quite tiny comparatively, and the army was quite basic. They are a long way behind in terms of military hardware but are clawing back some ground. Their IT capacity is probably further ahead because they are stronger there and the Pentagon has had a lot of concerns.\" Jiang also renewed China's warnings to Taiwan that its plans for a referendum on United Nations membership, to coincide with the presidential election this month, was putting the difficult relationship under further strain. He said the island would pay a \"heavy price\" if the public endorsed the motion.",

This increase is intended to enhance military capabilities and improve the living conditions of more than two million troops, including provisions for better training, higher salaries, and improved meals. According to Jiang Enzhu, a spokesman for China's parliament, some of the additional funds will be allocated to hardware development, aimed at improving the military's capacity to conduct war under IT-based conditions. He stated that the increase is considered 'moderate' due to the low starting point, despite a significant rise in the previous year. This announcement follows a Pentagon report released the previous day, which raised concerns about China's military advancements, including cyber-espionage activities, increased strike capabilities, and the testing of an anti-satellite weapon in the prior year. The report noted that the People's Liberation Army is undergoing a transformation from a mass army designed for protracted war to one capable of engaging in short-duration conflicts against high-tech adversaries along its periphery. The report also suggested that China's actual defense budget may be two to three times the officially reported amount from the previous year, although it would still be significantly lower than the United States' budget of 623 billion dollars for 2008. Jiang stated, 'In recent years the Chinese government has moderately increased its spending on national defence on the basis of sustained, steady and fast economic growth and rapid build-up of government revenues.

Trefor Moss, Asia Pacific editor at Jane's Defence Weekly, mentioned that it is difficult to determine the exact scale and nature of China's military development, but noted that China's spending was historically much lower than other countries, and its military infrastructure was relatively basic. He added that while China is behind in military hardware, it is making progress, particularly in IT capacities, which have drawn significant attention from the Pentagon. Jiang also reiterated China's stance regarding Taiwan, warning that plans for a referendum on United Nations membership, coinciding with the presidential election this month, could further strain relations between the two regions. He suggested that if the public supports the motion, the island may face 'heavy consequences.'"

        "original_text": "Severe pollution has made one-third of China's Yellow river unusable, according to new research. Known as the country's \"mother river\", it supplies water to millions of people in the north of China. But in recent years the quality has deteriorated due to factory discharges and sewage from fast-expanding cities. Much of it is now unfit even for agricultural or industrial use, the study shows. The survey, based on data taken last year, covered more than 8,384 miles of the river, one of the longest waterways in the world, and its tributaries. The Yellow River Conservancy Committee, affiliated to the ministry of water resources, said 33.8% of the river system's water sampled in 2007 registered worse than level five. That means it is unfit for drinking, aquaculture, industrial use and even agriculture, according to criteria used by the UN Environment Programme. Only 16% of the river samples reached level one or two, the standard considered safe for domestic use. The Yellow River is China's second-longest after the Yangtze, flowing west to east across the country through areas with high concentrations of factories. The report said waste and sewage water discharged into the system last year totalled 4.29bn tonnes. Industry and manufacturing made up 70% of the discharge into the river, with households accounting for 23% and just over 6% coming from other sources. \"It's not surprising,\" said Wen Bo, China programme director of the US-based environmental group, Pacific Environment. \"They are just treating the river as a dumping site. It's basically a sewage channel for the provinces that share the river.\" He told Associated Press that many polluting firms in the upper and middle reaches of Yellow river have avoided close local government scrutiny or had been protected because they provided jobs. There was no mechanism to allow richer provinces downstream to help poorer, polluting neighbours clean up, he added. Li Xiaoqiang, publicity chief with the Yellow River Conservancy Committee, told the state news agency, Xinhua, that people needed to become aware of saving and protecting water if the problem was not to spread further. China's State Council launched a nationwide campaign among industrial enterprises to save energy and slash the discharge of pollutants in the second half of last year. \"I wish a harmony could be achieved between development, utilisation, and protection of the river someday,\" said Li. A survey taken the previous year showed that 31.1% of the water was of level five standard, although the area sampled was slightly smaller. The total waste and sewage water discharged into the system was also slightly lower. The ministry of environmental protection warned this summer that pollution of China's waterways remained \"grave\". More than 20% of water tested in nearly 200 rivers was not safe to use, it added. The ministry has tried to shut down polluting factories along China's main waterways, but its power is limited because local environmental protection bureaus are under the control of local governments.",

        "original_text": "Now for the good news. Growth in the world's third largest economy dipped by no more than a rounding error in the final quarter of 2007. If one of the global economy's biggest engines is still firing - year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter came in at 11.2 per cent - can the rest of us fret a little less? Absolutely, say the optimists. Growth at these levels, even as other big economies began to wilt, points to continued strong domestic demand for everything from shoes (2.6bn feet!) to copper (that huge transmission grid). The latest quarterly data support this, but cracks have appeared in the December numbers. Year-on-year urban fixed-asset investment slowed sharply, to 19.3 per cent, and industrial production was a full percentage point below the first-half growth rate. Domestic dynamics, never mind the external slowdown, suggest activity will remain at more subdued levels. Beijing is reining in credit, in part by ordering banks to lend less. The battle against inflation has been made harder by the Federal Reserve's rapid-fire round of interest rate cuts. Raising rates in China, further widening the differential with the US, runs the risk of attracting more inflows of \"hot\" money. Instead, banks will likely bear the brunt through increased reserve requirements and a prolonged clampdown on lending. Sure, the impact on investment is mitigated because companies have other sources of funding, including strong balance sheets. But aggressive measures to cool the property market, for example, do not augur well for the construction sector. Reduced global demand for exports and higher input costs point to a deceleration in corporate earnings growth and quite possibly layoffs too. Banks, meanwhile, face the prospect of slower lending growth and a pick up in non-performing loans. China may be best in class, but that does not mean it will save the rest.",
        "debiased_text": "Growth in the world's third largest economy decreased slightly in the final quarter of 2007. Year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter was recorded at 11.2 per cent. Some analysts suggest that this continued growth, despite the weakening of other major economies, may alleviate concerns about global economic performance. This growth is attributed to strong domestic demand across various sectors, including footwear and copper. Recent quarterly data align with this perspective, though some indicators in theDecember numbers show signs of decline. Year-on-year urban fixed-asset investment slowed significantly to 19.3 per cent, and industrial production growth was a full percentage point lower than thegrowth rate in the first half of the year. Internal economic factors, in addition to the external slowdown, suggest that economic activity may remain at a more moderate level. Beijing has implemented measures to reduce credit availability, including directing banks to limit lending. The challenge in managing inflation has been compounded by the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate reductions. Increasing interest rates in China could lead to a larger interest rate differential with the United States, potentially attracting more foreign investment. However, banks are expected to absorb some of the impact through higher reserve requirements and extended lending restrictions. Companies may be somewhat shielded from these effects due to strong balance sheets and alternative funding sources. Measures aimed at cooling the property market could negatively affect the construction sector. Reduced global demand for exports and increased input costs may result in slower growth in corporate earnings and possibly job cuts. Banks are also expected to face slower lending growth and an increase in non-performing loans. While China's economy remains relatively strong, it may not necessarily provide support to the rest of the global economy."

        "original_text": "In the United States, there are more Chinese restaurants than McDonald's, Burger Kings and KFCs combined. Chances are, you've got your own favorite wonton spot. The Presidents Bush 41 and 43 do: the Peking Gourmet Inn in Falls Church, Va., which has installed bulletproof glass in front of table N17, just for them. In Iraq, homesick American troops frequented the two Chinese restaurants in Baghdad's Green Zone until they were shut down. Even at the American scientific outpost in Antarctica, every Monday is Chinese-food night (though good luck getting it delivered). Beyond peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches or a burger and fries, there may be no food that's more American than Chinese. The boardinghouse where John Wilkes Booth planned the assassination of President Lincoln? It's now an eatery called Wok 'n' Roll. But as Jennifer 8. Lee writes in her book The Fortune Cookie Chronicles: Adventures in the World of Chinese Food, the irony is that much of what we think of as Chinese food isn't Chinese at all. Chop suey is an American creation. Fortune cookies were invented in Japan. And get this: Kari-Out, the largest Chinese restaurant supplier in the United States, uses no soybeans in its soy sauce. So what, exactly, are we dousing with all that non-soy soy sauce? And if it's no more authentic than a pair of fake ivory chopsticks, why do we even bother to eat it? Lee, a reporter for The New York Times, says the cuisine's appeal lies in its dual nature: Chinese food is at once regional and universal, foreign and familiar. It has been a way for Americans to safely dabble in exoticism while holding on to their own cultural traditions. In the 1950s, she says, if you ate Chinese food, China itself seemed a lot less threatening. Although Chinese restaurants abound in other areas Korea, Peru, India, Japan, Mexico and Jamaica with large numbers of Chinese immigrants, Americans have them all beat. According to Lee, Thanksgiving is the only slow day in the Chinese-restaurant business, which is why so many waiters and cooks use that day to get married. It makes sense that we are obsessed with this ethnic food that has no true ethnicity: from its roots in a flood of immigration that evolved into a mix of cultural contradictions, the story of Chinese food in America is in many ways the story of America itself. The stream of Chinese immigrants to America has been constant since the Gold Rush in the 1840s and '50s, slowed only briefly by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Prejudice drove the unwelcome immigrants from jobs in the mines and on the railroads, but, as Lee writes, cooking and cleaning were both women's work. They were not threatening to white laborers. Which is why in 1885 New York City had six Chinese restaurants, but 20 years later there were more than 100. Today, Lee writes, if the immigrants are here illegally and cannot speak English, there's a good chance they'll wind up in New York's Chinatown, where employment agencies post listings from Chinese restaurants around the country. To these Chinese restaurant workers, who can barely read English, the United States is not a series of towns, Lee writes. It is a collection of area codes, almost all of which have dozens upon dozens of Chinese restaurants looking for help. Many of these illegal immigrants will have paid a smuggler as much as $70,000 to get them to this country. Such was the case of the 286 illegal immigrants aboard the Golden Venture, a ship that crashed into New York's shore in 1993. Fifteen years later, 90 percent of the immigrants still in the United States were in the Chinese-food business. They must be shocked by the food they're serving. When you eat out with Lee, you see how dishes have been adapted for American palates. Perusing the menu of a Shanghai-style Chinese restaurant in Manhattan, she asks the waiter about traditional whole-fish dishes. But when the plate arrives smeared with unnaturally bright red sauce studded with chunks of pineapple, she says, Oh, I guess it's just sweet and sour. Authentic Chinese food often involves bones, shells and eyeballs, more vegetables, less meat, less oil, she writes and, one presumes, no fluorescent sauces. But Lee hesitates to label restaurants authentic or inauthentic. Authenticity is a function of time and place, she says. I prefer traditional Chinese food. But that wasn't always the case. My taste evolved after I went to China. But it shouldn't matter if pineapples aren't found in China. Chinese food, whether Cantonese, Hunan, Sichuan or from Beijing, is remarkably adaptive, which explains how it's survived in the trenddriven U.S. restaurant world. In Louisiana, Lee sampled Sichuan alligator and soy vinegar crawfish. In Rhode Island she tried chow mein sandwiches: fried noodles on Wonder Bread. [ Editor's note: yuck. ] Chop suey has been replaced by beef with broccoli and General Tso's chicken, though in China more people are probably familiar with the colonel's chicken recipe than the general's. So the prevalence of restaurants will likely grow. In the three years Lee spent researching her book, the number of Chinese restaurants in the United States rose from 40,000 to 43,000. Whether the coming years see a surge in popularity of traditional Chinese-style fare or further interpretations of the cuisine (cheesesteak eggrolls, anyone?), Chinese food will continue to represent food for thought about our identity as Americans.",
        "debiased_text": "In the United States, the number of Chinese restaurants exceeds the combined total of McDonald's, Burger Kings, and KFC locations. It is common for individuals to have a preferred Chinese restaurant. Former U.S. Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush are known to favor the Peking Gourmet Inn in Falls Church, Virginia, where table N17 has bulletproof glass installed for their use. In Iraq, American military personnel who were stationed there often visited two Chinese restaurants located in Baghdad's Green Zone until those establishments were closed. Similarly, at the American scientific research station in Antarctica, Chinese food is served every Monday. While peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches or burgers and fries are commonly associated with American cuisine, Chinese food is also widely consumed in the U.S.\n\nThe boardinghouse where John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln, resided is now a restaurant named Wok 'n' Roll. According to Jennifer 8. Lee's book, The Fortune Cookie Chronicles: Adventures in the World of Chinese Food, many items commonly associated with Chinese food in the U.S. are not originally from China. For example, the dish chop suey was created in the United States, and fortune cookies were invented in Japan. Additionally, Kari-Out, the largest Chinese restaurant supplier in the U.S., does not use soybeans in its soy sauce. This raises the question of what is being used in the soy sauce, and whether the food served is authentic given these adaptations.\n\nLee, a reporter for The New York Times, notes that Chinese food has a dual nature, offering a balance between regional and universal elements. It allows Americans an opportunity to engage with foreign cuisine while maintaining familiarity. In the 1950s, dining at a Chinese restaurant could make China seem less intimidating. Chinese restaurants exist in various countries with large Chinese immigrant populations, such as Korea, Peru, India, Japan, Mexico, and Jamaica. However, the U.S. has the highest concentration of such establishments.\n\nAccording to Lee, Thanksgiving is typically the slowest time for Chinese restaurants, making it a common day for employees to get married. This is due to the high volume of Chinese restaurants across the country. Chinese food in the U.S. has a history that parallels the story of American immigration, beginning with the Gold Rush in the 1840s and '50s. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 briefly slowed the flow of immigrants, but outside work in mining and railroads, Chinese immigrants were often employed in cooking and cleaning, which were considered women's roles and not seen as a threat to white laborers. In 1885, New York City had six Chinese restaurants, and by 1905, that number exceeded 100.\n\nToday, Chinese immigrants who are undocumented and unable to speak English are often found in New York's Chinatown. Employment agencies in this area frequently post job listings for Chinese restaurants nationwide. These workers often do not know the English language well, and their perception of the U.S. is more about area codes than actual locations. Many of these undocumented immigrants have paid significant amounts to smugglers for entry into the country. This was the case with the 286 undocumented immigrants aboard the Golden Venture, a ship that crashed onto New York's coast in 1993. Fifteen years later, 90 percent of those still in the U.S. were working in the Chinese-food business.\n\nDuring a meal with Lee, she observed how Chinese dishes are often adapted to meet American tastes. At a Shanghai-style Chinese restaurant in Manhattan, she inquired about traditional whole-fish dishes but was served a plate with an unnaturally bright red sauce that included pineapple. She then recognized the dish as sweet and sour. Authentic Chinese dishes often contain bones, shells, and eyeballs, with more emphasis on vegetables than meat and less oil, according to Lee. However, she avoids labeling restaurants as either authentic or inauthentic, arguing that authenticity is a function of time and place.\n\nLee states that her preference for traditional Chinese food developed after visiting China. However, she acknowledges that some ingredients commonly used in U.S. Chinese cuisine, such as pineapple, are not native to China. Chinese cuisine, including Cantonese, Hunan, Sichuan, and Beijing styles, is known for its adaptability, which helps explain its continued presence in the diverse and trend-driven U.S. restaurant landscape. In Louisiana, Lee sampled Sichuan alligator and soy vinegar crawfish. In Rhode Island, she tried chow mein sandwiches, which feature fried noodles on Wonder Bread. [Editor's note: yuck.]\n\nBeef with broccoli and General Tso's chicken have largely replaced chop suey in American restaurants. In China, the chicken recipe associated with Colonel Sanders may be more widely recognized than the one attributed to a general. As Lee observed during her research, the number of Chinese restaurants in the U.S. increased from 40,000 to 43,000 over a three-year period. It is expected that the number of Chinese restaurants will continue to grow. The evolution of Chinese food in the U.S. may reflect continuing reinterpretations of the cuisine or a shift back toward traditional fare. Either way, Chinese food will remain a subject of reflection on American identity."

        "original_text": "Two gorillas are suspected of being the latest victims of the tainted milk scandal in China that has killed four infants and left more than 50,000 ill. The gorillas, both from Hangzhou Wildlife World in the eastern province of Zhejiang, are showing the early signs of kidney stones, according to local media reports. Both gorillas, aged one and three, had been fed with milk powder made by Sanlu Group, which is at the heart of the contamination scandal. Hundreds of milk and dairy products have been found to contain melamine, a compound used in making plastics that can cause kidney stones and even kidney failure. According to a report in the Hangzhou newspaper, the gorillas have been diagnosed with crystallisation in their urine – an early sign of kidney stones. \"The crystallisation now is very small, but it will grow bigger and then block the urine,\" Zhang Xu, a doctor from the animal hospital where the two gorillas were being treated, said. \"No visible stones have been found so far.\" The milk scandal, which began when dozens of babies became ill after drinking a popular milk brand, has spread to more than 20 companies and affected products including fresh milk, yoghurt and ice-cream. The head of China's food standard's agency has been forced to resign and countries across Asia have already banned or recalled a variety of milk products. Fears of contamination have reached Britain, with Tesco withdrawing a brand of Chinese confectionery from its shelves. Anxious parents have been queueing at hospitals to have their babies examined. The government has promised free treatment, but some families are concerned about costs and long-term complications. The milk contamination is the latest in a string of safety scares with Chinese-made products, ranging from medication to toys to pet food. The government has promised to tighten its safety regimes.",

The gorillas, both from Hangzhou Wildlife World in Zhejiang province, reportedly display early signs of kidney stones, as indicated by local media reports. The milk powder they were fed was produced by Sanlu Group, a company central to the contamination issue.

Zhang Xu, a doctor from the animal hospital treating the gorillas, stated that the crystallisation is currently small but could grow and obstruct urine flow. No visible stones have yet been detected. The milk scandal initially emerged when multiple infants fell ill after consuming a popular brand of milk. The issue has since expanded to over 20 companies, impacting products such as fresh milk, yogurt, and ice cream. The head of China's food standards agency has resigned, and several Asian countries have either banned or recalled various milk products. Concerns about contamination have extended to the United Kingdom, where Tesco has removed a brand of Chinese confectionery from its stores. Parents have been queuing at hospitals to have their children checked for possible effects. The government has assured free medical treatment for affected individuals, although some families remain concerned about medical costs and potential long-term health effects. The milk contamination incident is the most recent in a series of safety issues involving Chinese-made products, including medications, toys, and pet food.

The office of the 73-year-old Tibetan spiritual leader said he was suffering from exhaustion and had cancelled two planned international trips. \"Since tests haven't begun yet, we don't know what the ailment is,'' said his spokesman, Tenzin Takla. ''Medical tests will begin on Friday.'' Yesterday, the Dalai Lama's office announced he had called off trips to Mexico and the Dominican Republic to spend three weeks recuperating after being diagnosed with exhaustion. Takla said the Dalai Lama would spend time resting in Mumbai before returning to Dharmsala, where he has lived since fleeing Tibet in 1959. A spokesman for Mumbai's Lilavati hospital suggested the visit was unexpected. \"He comes every six months for a routine checkup. Around a month ago, a checkup was conducted and he was in perfect health,\" Mohan Rajan said. The Dalai Lama will be under the care of senior surgeon Narendra Trivedi while at the hospital. He had just returned to India from an 11-day visit to France, which followed an intense few months since riots against Chinese rule broke out in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa. The spiritual leader spends several months a year traveling the globe to draw attention to the struggle of Tibetans for greater freedom in China and to teach Buddhism.

A slump in banking shares sent the FTSE 100 tumbling around 100 points in early trading. But better than expected figures from Wells Fargo in the US helped prompt something of a recovery. Investors were not completely convinced, however. The fear of more damage to come from the credit crunch remains not far below the surface. Even so, after earlier hefty falls, Barclays ended 6.25p higher at 266.75p. Royal Bank of Scotland, hit by worries about possible huge write-offs at its Citizens business in the US, recovered from a 23p fall to end down just 2.3p at 165p. HBOS, whose cash call closes this week, closed down 5.5p at 254.5p after dropping as low as 225p. Miners took over from banks as the sector no one wanted to invest in, as Goldman Sachs talked of a possible slowdown in China. Xstrata fell nearly 5% to £35.38, while Antofagasta lost a similar amount to 522.5p. One company which was under the cosh all day was building materials business Wolseley, down more than 6% to 272.25p after a badly received trading statement. But with Wells Fargo and the drop in crude prompting a 100 rise on Wall Street, the FTSE 100 ended down just 21.3 points at 5150.6. Oil was on the slide for the second day as US crude stocks for last week came in higher than expected, reinforcing suggestions that the American economic slowdown was hitting demand levels. This was not exactly good news for the oil majors of course, with Royal Dutch Shell B shares down 66p to £17.73, BP 14.75p lower at 509.5p and Tullow down 32.5p to 788p. One remarkable turnaround was publisher Trinity Mirror. After falling more than 20% on worries about its debt and pension deficity, it issued what was intended to be a calming statement to the market. And what do you know? It worked. It ended up 10.5% at 60.5p, putting some pressure on those shorting the shares.",

        "original_text": "Olympics to fuel reforms, says Hu ; House vote on rights 'odious' Chinese President Hu Jintao warned yesterday against politicising the coming Olympic Games and said the games would help accelerate the modernisation of the country. Speaking a week before the opening of the Olympics, Mr Hu said the government would pursue rapid economic growth while trying to keep price increases under control. Mr Hu's comments follow persistent criticisms that both China and the International Olympics Committee have failed to fulfil pledges about media freedom and human rights issues ahead of the games. \"Politicising the Olympics goes against the Olympic spirit and the shared aspirations of people all over the world,\" he told a group of foreign reporters in a rare interview. \"The current dream of the Chinese people is to accelerate building a modern country and realise the great renaissance of the Chinese nation.\" Earlier this week, US President George W. Bush met prominent Chinese dissidents at the White House while the US House of Representatives passed a resolution urging China to honour a pledge to improve human rights before the games by 419 votes to 1. Liu Jianchao, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, described the House vote as \"odious conduct\" and an attempt to \"sabotage\" the Olympics, while by meeting the dissidents, he said, Mr Bush \"has rudely interfered in China's internal affairs and sent a seriously wrong message to anti-China hostile forces\". IOC officials said some websites that had been blocked at the Olympics media centre, such as Amnesty International, would now be available to foreign journalists, though sites on other controversial topics such as Tibet and the Falun Gong sect would still be blocked. In the run-up to the games, the IOC had insisted there would be no internet censorship at the media centre. Mr Hu's comments about ensuring strong economic growth came as an official survey pointed to a sharp decline in manufacturing activity. \"We must maintain steady, relatively fast development and control excessive price rises as the priority tasks of macro adjustment,\" he said. His words echoed several official announcements in the past week maintaining a cautious stance on inflation and emphasising the importance of preventing a sharp slowdown in the economy. Economists expect the new rhetoric to lead to a fine-tuning of existing strategy rather than a sharp change in policy to stimulate growth. The authorities this week increased the tax rebate on textile exports and there were reports that the central bank had introduced a modest increase in quotas for new bank lending, especially to smaller companies.",

        "title": "Big debate: is it worth spending £235m to send the GB team to Beijing?",
        "original_text": "YES John Steele UK Sport chief executive Some of you reading this may do a double-take when you see the figure involved, as £235m sounds like a serious amount of money. But we are a nation that is now serious about its sport — and Olympic and Paralympic sport in particular. After all, we are looking forward to hosting the world's biggest sporting event in four years. We know Seb Coe and his team will create the ultimate setting for the London 2012 Games but they won't be a success if the home team don't perform. Seb himself has said that home athletes winning medals is not the icing on the cake for 2012 success, rather the key ingredient. Which brings us to the figure of £235m . That represents our total investment in 24 Olympic sports over the past four years, with more invested in Paralympic sport via the government and the lottery. Like all big numbers, it helps to break it down to understand what we hope it can deliver. Of UK Sport's £235m investment a lot less than half has actually been targeted at the athletes who will make up Team GB in Beijing. We have invested £22m a year to support our best talent — still a lot of money but more reasonable when you realise it underpins the medal hopes of more than 300 athletes. The investment is necessary; the days of the plucky amateur are long gone. Olympic sport is now a sophisticated science and anything that can make as little as a 1% performance improvement can mean the difference between ending up on the podium or finishing among the also-rans. Consider Athens, where five of GB's golds were won by a collective margin of only 0.545 of a second. So we invest to allow our athletes to train full-time and have access to the country's best coaches, facilities, technology and medical support. We also ensure that they are ready to compete in any environment , by acclimatising to jet lag, heat and humidity — all of which present hurdles to success in Beijing. The list goes on and it all costs money — an average of £50,000 a year for our Olympians — from Chris Hoy to Tom Daley. That is what it takes to achieve those moments that last long in the memory. Our athletes' success is also an inspiration that will get people into sport and help tackle issues from obesity to social inclusion. We can only have this sense of confidence because we are on the road to building a world-class system — in Olympic sport there are no half measures, just a commitment to work as a team delivering success. UK Sport's investment will contribute to medal success in Beijing and even more so in London. That makes the £235m not just worth spending but money well spent. NO Paul MacInnes Entertainment Editor, theguardian.com As Father Ted once said to Father Dougal while attempting to explain the concept of perspective using toy cows: \"These are small, the others are far away.\" The price of sending our elite athletes to Beijing for four weeks may look sizeable, but is it genuinely high or is it simply because so few people have a close interest in athletics that the price appears so huge? One British Olympic team would only get you 12.4 Robbie Keanes — barely a matchday squad's-worth under new Uefa regulations. It would, however, also buy you roughly 2.3 Dark Knights which, given recent box office takings, might be the cause of a public outpouring of joy on the part of the nation's awkward, lank-haired teenage boys. Anything can be justified with the aid of perspective. But who decides from which angle to look at the Olympics? Well, the government obviously and, by extension, UK Sport and, in spirit, all those parents who push their children through years of competitive agony for a medal their child subsequently discovers is made of plastic and a sticker . It is fair to say the government does not consult people who think the coxless fours are a group of harmonising eunuchs. Another way to look at the cost of sending a team to the Games and whether it in any way offers value for money might be to look at what is hoped for in exchange for our expenditure. A decent performance at the Games? What is decent? Would we be happy to settle for a 10% improvement on our lacklustre performance in Athens? Would that be worth it? Even if they could mint that extra 9/10ths of a gold medal we would have earned? Or is it more about 2012, about showing that we have taken the Games seriously this time and that, therefore, we are trustworthy custodians of the flame? That raises the question of why we want the Olympics in London, a question with answers so nebulous that the capital's former mayor felt free to confess his bid had been a \"con trick\" in order to redevelop the East End, as he knew full well that patriotic pride at having landed the world's premier international multi-sporting event was unlikely to be pricked. All I know is that there is no objective way of proving that £235m is the appropriate sum to spend on sending so many athletes to China. It is, however, possible to show that the world would not stop turning if we did not and that, short of a few feisty editorials and the odd episode of Panorama, the country would not rise up in disgust. Stop funding the Eurovision Song Contest, however, ( at £173,000 per annum) and, mark my words, there would be riots.",
        "debiased_text": "John Steele, Chief Executive of UK Sport, stated that the figure of £235m represents the total investment in 24 Olympic sports over the past four years, with additional funding for Paralympic sports sourced from the government and the lottery. He emphasized that this investment is intended to support the performance of the home team at the Beijing Olympics and to prepare for the London 2012 Games. Steele noted that less than half of the £235m is directed toward athletes competing in Beijing, with £22m annually allocated to support over 300 athletes. This funding is used to provide access to high-quality coaches, facilities, technology, and medical support, as well as to help athletes adapt to environmental conditions such as jet lag, heat, and humidity. The average annual cost per Olympian is approximately £50,000, ranging from established athletes like Chris Hoy to newcomers like Tom Daley. Steele argued that this investment is necessary given the highly competitive nature of modern Olympic sports and that it helps ensure successful performances, which in turn can inspire public engagement in sports and address broader societal issues.\n\nPaul MacInnes, Entertainment Editor at theguardian.com, raised questions about the perspective used to evaluate the cost of the investment in the British Olympic team. He suggested that the £235m appears significant due to the limited public interest in athletics, comparing it to the cost of other national initiatives. MacInnes pointed out that it is unclear how the government defines a 'decent' performance at the Olympics and questioned whether a 10% improvement over past results would be sufficient. He also considered whether the investment is more about preparing for the 2012 Games and demonstrating commitment to the event rather than solely about medal counts. MacInnes noted that the rationale for hosting the Olympics inLondon is not clearly defined, with the former mayor admitting the bid was primarily aimed at redevelopment. He concluded that while there is no objective measure for determining if £235m is an appropriate expenditure, it is possible to argue that the country would not react strongly to the discontinuation of such funding, unlike the potential response to cutting funding for the Eurovision Song Contest, which costs £173,000 per annum."

        "title": "Richard Lea on China's changing literary culture",
        "original_text": "\"It's like a huge container ship coming into view,\" says Paul Richardson, an international research fellow at the Chinese Institute of Publishing Sciences in Beijing, \"full of Christmas decorations, white goods and sportswear, but there's this other side to it, full of books, paintings and so on, which we are completely unaware of.\" \"If you asked the average Guardian reader to name a modern Chinese writer of fiction they'd be hard pressed,\" he continues. \"If this is to be the Chinese century, we have no idea what that will mean.\" The world's most populous nation, the world's biggest consumer of raw materials, and now the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, China strides irresistibly towards its economic and political destiny. But as Beijing prepares for its Olympic extravaganza this summer, the cultural life of the 1.3 billion people who live and work in this economic superpower remains a closed book to many in the west - their bestselling authors unfamiliar, their most exciting writers untranslated. It's a situation rendered all the more peculiar by the immense size of the Chinese publishing industry. \"The sheer scale of everything in China is overwhelming,\" says Richardson. \"China has one of the three great book publishing industries in the world. Along with the UK and the US it publishes around 200,000 new titles and new editions a year, well ahead of the nearest rivals, Japan, Russia and Germany. It is by far the largest publishing market by volume - officially about 6bn units a year, but many more when pirated copies are taken into account. In terms of value the market will probably amount to around £4-5bn in 2007, which would put it fourth in the world - behind the US, Germany and Japan and ahead of the UK. If you take purchasing power parity into account it is second only to the US.\" The Chinese literary world is like a parallel universe, almost invisible to many in the west, complete with big hitters (Su Tong and Jia Pingwa), innovators (Xi Chuan and Che Qianzi), and bestselling superstars (Han Han and Annie Baobei), some of whom are earning more than £1m a year. Though as the Beijing-based translator and journalist Eric Abrahamsen points out, these figures should be taken with a pinch of salt. \"The number of books sold is a mystery to everyone,\" he says. This is at least partly because of the unique constitution of the Chinese publishing industry. \"Officially, publishing is still an activity reserved to the state. So unlike, say, printing or bookselling, no private or foreign direct participation is allowed,\" explains Richardson. There are some 570 state publishing houses, which until recently were insulated from the vicissitudes of the market. \"Now they are 'cultural enterprises', are expected to become financially independent and are allowed to compete in each others' patches.\" As always in China, Richardson continues, \"things are more complicated than they would appear at an official level\". Alongside the state houses are \"cultural studios\", private publishers that supply creative input for the state houses (which is legal), or simply buy ISBNs and publish themselves (which is not). \"Meanwhile foreign publishers also cannot participate directly, but all the major international publishing companies have some form of representation in China and many have worked out forms of co-operation with Chinese partners that get under the wire.\" None of which is making things easier for writers still adjusting to the new realities of the marketplace. \"The writers get screwed left, right and centre,\" says Abrahamsen. \"The whole publishing industry is a mess.\" Underneath the confusion, however, there is an unprecedented opportunity for publishers to break into an underdeveloped market, and one which, according to the translator Nicky Harman, has an undeniable thirst for books. \"When you go to big towns you see these huge shops called shu cheng - book cities - which are the size of department stores.\" she says. Beijing Book City, for example, employs about 700 people and carries 230,000 titles on the shelves. \"Last time I was in Wuhan people were queuing up on a Sunday morning, waiting for the shop to open. You find people sitting on the floor reading books, squatting on tables, crowding the aisles, filling trolleys. They're stuffed with people.\" And in contrast with the west, it's mostly young people. \"The older generation matured through the Cultural Revolution,\" says Richardson. \"They grew up in a very different world. So far as they do read books for pleasure, they're likely to read the classics. \"Now there's this whole generation of young people, who have grown up since the Cultural Revolution, who aren't that interested in the classics, but are deeply involved with the changes in society, the future, the terrific things happening around them. That's what moves them.\" \"The older writers will complain that young people aren't reading any literature,\" adds Harman, \"but they read a lot more than our young people do. They're just not reading what the old guard want them to.\" And it's not just Harry Potter - though JK Rowling has been huge in both legitimate and pirated versions. Much teen fiction is not written by respectable middle-aged writers, but by young people themselves. Han Han, a superstar author who drives racing cars, found fame as a 17-year-old back in 1997. Zhang Yueran, whose sensationalist plot lines would carry parental advisories in the west, was first published in magazines at 14. \"It's interesting and lively,\" says Harman, \"but it's not great literature.\" Young people are also reading online, with literature sites like Rongshu and Qidian publishing original work by established authors, finding new authors themselves and publishing their own content between hard covers. The scale is massive again, with Rongshu boasting two million registered users, daily page views of more than 5m and more than 1.9m works of literature on the site. But according to Michel Hockx, professor of Chinese at SOAS, the most striking difference between Chinese sites and their western equivalents is the status afforded online literature in China. \"The internet has a much more significant role in literature than it does here,\" he says. \"It's taken very seriously, discussed very seriously and famous writers take part.\" The general manager of Penguin China, Jo Lusby, is even more emphatic. \"All credible interesting writing in China begins online at the moment,\" she says. \"It's given an added boost because it exists in a relatively free space outside of the tight constraints of traditional publishers.\" Writers and publishers are grabbing at all the multimedia tools the 21st century has to offer - blogs, audio, e-books. \"Literature on mobile phones is massive in China,\" says Lusby. \"The tube is so packed in Beijing you can't physically open a book, so everybody is reading on their mobiles.\" Penguin are working on a deal with a mobile company to put Penguin Classics on phones. According to the London-based Chinese poet Yang Lian the web is also becoming increasingly important for poets. At a time when formal publishers or magazines are \"almost all refusing to publish any poems\", the strength of poetry on the net makes today \"the most exciting time since 1949. The internet provides possibilities for poets in different parts of the country to meet each other day to day.\" They can discuss literature, give each other feedback and even get involved in joint projects. \"It's like back in the 1970s,\" he continues, \"just after the Cultural Revolution. Publishing poems on the internet, or printing books yourselves to give to your friends is just like how we older poets were working at the end of the 70s or the beginning of the 80s.\" The difference between the 1970s samizdat poets and their online successors is the market - a force that Yang suggests has \"woken up\" the individuality of the Chinese people. \"You can feel the reawakening of individuality even in the language writers are using,\" he says. \"This is the foundation of any real literature.\" But just as the market encourages some to pursue their own vision, according to Yang it can also be a temptation. \"The whole country is now very commercial,\" he says. \"A lot of novelists are trying to join the market, even though the market is totally controlled by the Communist Party ideology. Serious, individual thinking in China is very weak.\" With market values on the rise, he continues, poetry in particular plays a vital role. \"In the face of commercialism, poetry demonstrates an extremely important and more serious side of Chinese culture.\" Born in 1955, Yang's ambivalence towards the market is an attitude characteristic of the generation of writers who grew up during the Cultural Revolution, an attitude questioned by many of the younger generation. According to Hockx, China's unique status as both post-modern and post-socialist gives relations between writers and the marketplace an added layer of complexity. \"To be unashamedly commercial in China is almost a literary position,\" he says. \"The younger generation is moving away from the idea that literature is something to do with politics, that writers are in some sense the conscience of the nation.\" This produces the unusual spectacle of the government agreeing with some of its former critics in criticising this commercial work. \"All of a sudden writers are able to get huge deals for translation rights which didn't exist before,\" Hockx continues. \"That's partly why some writers are becoming a little more commercial, a little less avant garde - they just want to cash in.\" This rush to the market has led to a \"huge explosion\" in genre fiction, according to Abrahamsen, with martial arts, sword and sorcery, romance and crime fiction very popular. \"It's sort of a release,\" he says, \"as if people are saying 'finally we can sit down and read a romantic novel in the afternoon, rather than worrying'.\" He is less optimistic about the prospects for literary fiction, suggesting that authors are \"writing for a population that doesn't want to think about their lives\" and would rather just get on with making money. There is a small group of \"very smart, very brave\" writers trying to understand what's happening to China in a period of change so rapid that \"people are living differently now to how they were even six months ago\", but it is increasingly hard for them to find an audience for their work. \"Almost nobody else is interested. The government's implicit deal is 'Don't ask too many questions, just do your thing',\" he explains. \"There are a lot of really disheartened writers who would like to put their heart and soul into writing, but who aren't doing it because most people aren't reading it.\" The Nanjing-based poet and novelist Han Dong is equally pessimistic. \"The fact is that readers' interest in contemporary literature is waning, the number of people who read any kind of literature is dropping, and the number of those who read contemporary work is dropping even more,\" he says. \"If a writer is only motivated by the desire to be read, then the current environment is disastrous.\" \"It's possible to do good work, but it's hard,\" agrees Yang. \"I was among the so-called Misty Poets - we were the founders of contemporary Chinese poetry after the Cultural Revolution. We had this magazine called Today, which began in 1978. Among our group were five or six important poets. Now, apart from me and one other, all the others have stopped writing. \"We are about 50 years old,\" he says, \"which should be the most important time for a writer - our life experience is getting deeper, our knowledge of literature, our technique - but there's nobody actually writing any more.\" Part two: What does the future hold for Chinese literature?",
        "debiased_text": "Paul Richardson, an international research fellow at the Chinese Institute of Publishing Sciences in Beijing, notes that China's publishing industry is large and diverse, with a significant emphasis on consumer goods such as Christmas decorations, white goods, and sportswear, while its literary output remains relatively unknown in the West. He mentions that many Western readers, even those of The Guardian, may struggle to name a contemporary Chinese fiction writer. Richardson highlights the scale of China's publishing industry, stating that it ranks among the three largest in the world, alongside the UK and US, with approximately 200,000 new titles and editions published annually. The total volume of books published is approximately 6 billion units per year, with additional volumes from pirated copies. In terms of value, the market is projected to reach around £4-5 billion in 2007, placing it fourth globally. Considering purchasing power parity, it would be second only to the US. He further explains that the industry is influenced by both state and private entities, described as 'cultural enterprises' that are expected to operate financially independently and may compete in each other's areas.\n\nEric Abrahamsen, a Beijing-based translator and journalist, mentions that accurate sales figures for books in China are unclear. He notes that the Chinese publishing industry consists of state-owned publishers and 'cultural studios,' which are private publishers. These studios may legally supply creative input for state publishers or operate in ways that are not fully compliant with regulations. He points out that foreign publishers do not have direct involvement in the industry, but major international publishing companies have some form of representation in China and have developed cooperative relationships with local partners.\n\nAccording to Abrahamsen, the changes in the publishing industry have created challenges for writers. However, there is an opportunity for publishers to enter an underdeveloped market, which has a high demand for books. Nicky Harman, a translator, notes that large cities in China have book stores known as 'shu cheng,' which are comparable in size to department stores and feature a wide variety of titles. She also mentions that many individuals, particularly younger people, are actively engaged in reading activities in these stores, often in crowded conditions.\n\nRichardson suggests that younger generations in China have different reading habits than their predecessors, who were shaped by experiences during the Cultural Revolution. The younger generation is often more focused on contemporary issues and less interested in classic literature. Harman explains that while younger Chinese readers are consuming a lot of literature, it is not the same type that older writers prefer. This includes a significant amount of teen fiction not written by established middle-aged authors, but rather by youth themselves.\n\nOnline platforms, such as Rongshu and Qidian, have emerged as important mediums for both established and new authors. These sites provide extensive content and have a large user base. Michel Hockx, a Chinese professor at SOAS, emphasizes the prominent role of the internet in Chinese literary culture, suggesting that it is taken as seriously as traditional publishing and that well-known writers actively participate. Jo Lusby, the general manager of Penguin China, adds that a substantial amount of credible and interesting writing now begins online due to the relatively free space available, as opposed to the constraints of traditional publishing.\n\nWriters and publishers are utilizing various multimedia tools, such as blogs, audio, and e-books. Literature on mobile phones is gaining significant importance, with some publishers working on deals to provide classic texts on mobile devices. Yang Lian, a London-based Chinese poet, also notes the rising importance of the web for poets, as traditional publishers and magazines increasingly avoid publishing poetry. This has created opportunities for poets to share and discuss their work online, reminiscent of how poets shared work in the 1970s and 1980s under different circumstances.\n\nWith the rise in market values, Yang suggests that the market may be awakening individuality among the Chinese people, influencing the literary landscape. However, the market is controlled by Communist Party ideology, and he notes that serious and individual thinking is currently weak in China. He observes that the market encourages some to focus on commercial appeal but also presents challenges for writers trying to maintain a serious and individual approach.\n\nHockx discusses the complexity in China's literary market due to its status as both post-modern and post-socialist. He notes that being openly commercial in China has become a literary position for some younger writers, who are shifting away from the earlier belief that literature should be tied to political issues. As a result, the government has aligned with some former critics in condemning this commercial work. Such shifts have led to an increase in genre fiction, like martial arts, romance, and crime stories, as a form of entertainment.\n\nDespite this, Abrahamsen is less optimistic about the prospects for literary fiction, indicating that many authors are writing for audiences that prefer not to engage with deep reflections on their lives, instead prioritizing more straightforward forms of content. Han Dong, a poet and novelist based in Nanjing, also expresses concerns that the interest in contemporary literature is declining, making it challenging for writers seeking an audience for their work. Yang agrees, reflecting on how his generation, the Misty Poets, once played a significant role in Chinese poetry but now finds many of their peers no longer writing due to the current literary climate."

        "original_text": "A massive earthquake rocked southwestern China on Monday, resulting in a death toll of more than 9,000 and creating a new crisis for China's leaders after several that have heavily tested the regime this year. The quake, among the most powerful to hit a populated area in recent years, flattened school buildings, shops and homes across a wide, mountainous area around the epicenter in China's Sichuan province. Local officials estimated 3,000 to 5,000 people died in a single Sichuan county, called Beichuan, where 80% of the buildings were estimated to have collapsed, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Tuesday morning in China, it listed the death toll at 9,219. The full scale of the devastation wasn't clear, in part because of damage to communications lines in the affected area. Rain, as well as rocks and boulders blocking roads, hampered rescue efforts, Xinhua said. In the town of Dujiangyan, near the quake's epicenter, fewer than 100 students out of 420 survived the collapse of a school building, Xinhua said. The news agency initially said 900 might be buried. Outside the school, known as Juyuan Middle School, scores of parents huddled under tarps in the rain sobbing and awaiting news of their children. \"When the building came down there was no one to help us,\" said Li Dachang, whose 16-year-old daughter was later pulled dead from the rubble. \"The quality of the construction was so poor. There are so many corrupt officials. They take the money and build shoddy buildings.\" \"They haven't found our kids,\" said Wang Zhouqun, wiping away tears. Her teenage daughter was still missing. The devastation represents the latest of several crises to test China's leadership in a year that was supposed to be dominated by Beijing's hosting of the Summer Olympics in August. Winter storms in January -- China's worst in 50 years -- shut down much of the country's central and southern regions for weeks and killed crops and livestock, exacerbating already high inflation. In March, antigovernment protests in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, and the resulting government crackdown, triggered unrest throughout ethnically Tibetan areas in much of western China. Monday's quake struck in part of that region. The Tibet flare-up fueled criticism of China's government internationally, leading to protests during the Olympic torch relay through major Western cities, which in turn caused an anti-Western backlash in China. Following these crises, the earthquake's aftermath is likely to be watched closely within China as a test of the leadership's ability to coordinate a complicated relief effort -- and of how it balances its own desire to seem self-sufficient against the need to request any resources from abroad that it might not have. Relief groups, already contending with the aftermath of the recent cyclone in neighboring Myanmar, said they were awaiting word from Chinese authorities on whether assistance was desired. The quake also could offer a test of China's adherence to earthquake standards in the midst of a massive building boom, and could put local officials under pressure as well. The quake, which struck midafternoon local time, measured at magnitude 7.9, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The initial jolt was so powerful it was felt as far away as Bangkok. It prompted evacuations of offices towers in Beijing and Shanghai, both more than 900 miles away, as office buildings swayed enough to make some workers nauseous. More than a dozen aftershocks followed, many of them topping magnitude 5.0. Hundreds of people were trapped under two collapsed chemical plants in a town called Shifang, where tons of leaked liquid ammonia caused the evacuation of 6,000 people, Xinhua reported. In Dujiangyan, entire blocks of six- and seven-story houses collapsed into piles of bricks, concrete slabs and splintered furniture. \"My father died in there,\" said Fu Xufen, who had rushed to check on her father after the quake hit and found a pile of rubble where his building had been. In the Sichuan city of Mianzhu, two temporary medical shelters were set up after local hospitals lost power and ran out of water, according to Yang Yue, a government doctor dispatched to one of these shelters. He said 700 to 800 patients have already been treated or have died from injuries. \"We're not even counting the dead who haven't been dug up,\" he said. Mr. Yang said critically ill patients have been bused to hospitals in neighboring provinces. Outside, Zhu Zhenyong cradled his dead 6-month-old boy. The quake decimated their home in 30 to 40 seconds, Mr. Zhu said. His wife ran back into the house after the walls collapsed on their son, he said. Nurses bandaged the injured child, who later died, before moving on to other patients, he said. China's leaders moved immediately to show the public they were dealing with the disaster. Premier Wen Jiabao left Beijing for the affected area within hours of the quake, and state-run media later showed images of him with a bullhorn calling to possible survivors in the rubble of a wrecked hospital in Dujiangyan. President Hu Jintao convened a special meeting of the ruling Communist Party's powerful Politburo Standing Committee to discuss the disaster, and said relief and rescue work would be the government's \"top priority.\" Tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers and paramilitary police were dispatched to the area to aid the relief effort, Xinhua said. Analysts said China's government is likely to assemble a more effective response than has been seen in Myanmar, where the military leadership's refusal to accept many outside aid shipments has been blamed for likely exacerbating the toll. Still, if it needs aid such as equipment and dogs to find survivors, China would need to request it quickly to be effective, aid experts said. Hours after the quake, the Czech Republic's government offered a team of 15 earthquake search experts and their specially trained dogs, an embassy spokesman in Washington, D.C., confirmed. A statement from the Czech embassy in Beijing distributed by the Foreign Correspondents Club of China said China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs promised \"to study\" the proposal. The Czech embassy spokesman said Monday afternoon that his nation hadn't heard from Chinese officials. Chinese officials couldn't be reached. The most-important thing \"now is the evacuation and rescue operation, and providing basic shelter and food,\" said Qinghui Gu, a disaster-management official with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. He said his organization was struggling to obtain detailed information from the affected area but that the early official estimates indicated that it would be \"a huge disaster.\" The earthquake isn't likely to significantly slow China's surging economic growth because the Sichuan region isn't a major manufacturing center, according to a Merrill Lynch report. Reaction from China's stock markets was muted Monday, before word of the quake's magnitude spread. The Shanghai Composite Index opened down 3.1% Tuesday morning, and authorities said they would suspend trading in 66 companies with major interests in Sichuan until more information about damage was known. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake's epicenter was about 55 miles northwest of Chengdu, capital of Sichuan, one of China's most heavily populated provinces. Ambulances carrying the seriously injured streamed into Chengdu Tuesday morning. With aftershocks still rolling through the region Tuesday, residents of Chengdu -- a city of about 10 million people -- huddled along the road under heavy rain, too fearful to go back indoors. Zhang Huiyong, a 50-year-old construction worker, brought quilts down from her seventh-floor apartment downtown to spend the night outside with her family. \"I'm afraid there's going to be another earthquake,\" Ms. Zhang said. \"I'm very scared.\" China's red-hot economy has seen a construction boom in recent years, and experts say buildings in major cities like Chengdu tend to adhere according to strict earthquake-safety guidelines. Those standards are especially strict in the region of Monday's quake. But enforcement of those standards tends to be much less rigorous in smaller towns and villages. \"What I worry most about is the village houses in Sichuan province. I really wonder if they have been constructed to resist earthquakes,\" said Zhang Limin, a professor in the civil-engineering department of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Mr. Zhang's parents live about 50 kilometers from the epicenter and he was unable to reach them Monday afternoon. --- Kersten Zhang in Beijing, Ellen Zhu in Shanghai, Bai Lin in Chengdu, Jonathan Cheng and Sky Canaves in Hong Kong and Hiroko Tabuchi in Tokyo contributed to this article.

The U.S. Geological Survey located the earthquake's epicenter approximately 55 miles northwest of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, which is one of China's most densely populated provinces. Ambulances carrying the seriously injured arrived in Chengdu on Tuesday morning. Aftershocks continued in the region, prompting residents of Chengdu to remain outside due to fear of further tremors. Zhang Huiyong, a construction worker, brought quilts from her apartment to sleep outside with her family. She expressed concern about the possibility of another earthquake. While major cities like Chengdu reportedly adhere to strict earthquake safety guidelines, enforcement of such standards in smaller towns and villages could be less consistent. Professor Zhang Limin from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology expressed concerns about the building standards in rural areas of Sichuan, and reported an inability to contact his parents, who reside near the epicenter."

        "original_text": "As the Chinese recover from the aftermath of the devastating earthquake, it's worth remembering that they can't rebuild Sichuan province alone. They need America's help. In the months to come, China's central and provincial governments will spend billions to remake hospitals, communication and power networks, roads and infrastructure, dams and water-treatment facilities, factories, schools and houses. But many of the goods and services needed to rebuild aren't produced in China. That's not because of any damage that the earthquake may have caused; Sichuan accounts for less than 4% of China's GDP. Rather, there's a fundamental deficiency in China's industrial capability. In most industries, China lags decades behind the U.S., with factories that don't meet modern quality standards. That's a problem if you want to make a Barbie doll, but it's an even bigger problem if you want to make a safe nuclear power plant. Or rebuild a province. U.S. exports to China will no doubt increase as a result of the earthquake, but China buying American is nothing new. Indeed, China is our third-largest export market behind Canada and Mexico. Few politicians talk about it, but 406 out of 435 Congressional districts have seen triple-digit export growth to China from 2000-2007. Those exports have created jobs and built value in local communities. In fact, U.S. exports to China are growing five times faster than any other export market. This is less a function of the falling dollar and more of rising Chinese demand for U.S. products. Put simply, they need what we make -- from chemicals and components to turbines and telecommunications, from drugs and medical devices to sewage and sanitation equipment. If a product requires modern technology and precise engineering, chances are, China needs it. Not to mention all the services and after-care required for set up and maintenance. The broader lesson here applies to our ailing economy. If the International Monetary Fund is right and the U.S. economy is slipping into a recession that will ripple out into the global economy, then that ripple will stop at China's shore. China's demand will help absorb the shock of our solvency crisis. To understand why, we need to compare balance sheets. China is essentially America's economic alter ego. American households have a negative savings rate. Chinese households have a formidable 80% savings rate. Our treasury is trillions in debt. China's treasury has trillions in retained earnings. We're leveraged to the gills. China is swimming in black ink. China's behemoth currency reserves and strong demand were why China was able to weather another financial crisis -- the currency crisis that hit Southeast Asia in the 1990s. China was one of the only regional economies not to collapse. Indeed, its savings rate and high demand helped rescue its neighbors. More than a decade later, China has accumulated even greater savings. There's enough money under China's mattress to midwife the largest middle class on the planet. Which means China will keep buying more and more from America. China couldn't ask for a better time to buy American. The falling value of the dollar -- coupled with the steep appreciation in China's yuan -- is nothing short of a gale force tailwind for U.S. exporters. The Sichuan earthquake only adds urgency to China's already powerful demand. So, in dealing with this catastrophe, America and China's interests are aligned. By exporting American goods and services, we help China in a desperate time of need -- while creating jobs and building up our national savings account in the process. ---",
        "debiased_text": "Following the earthquake in Sichuan province, the Chinese government and local authorities are working on reconstruction efforts, which include rebuilding hospitals, communication systems, power networks, roads, infrastructure, dams, water-treatment facilities, factories, schools, and housing. The rebuilding process will require significant financial and material resources. While China has the capacity to produce many of these goods and services, some required for the reconstruction are not manufactured domestically. This is not due to damage from the earthquake, as Sichuan contributes less than 4% to China's GDP. Rather, it is attributed to the current industrial capabilities of China, which may not fully meet modern quality standards in certain sectors.\n\nU.S. exports to China are expected to increase following the earthquake, though this trend has been ongoing. China is the third-largest export market for the United States, following Canada and Mexico. Between 2000 and 2007, exports to China from 406 out of 435 U.S. Congressional districts experienced triple-digit growth, contributing to jobcreation and economic activity in local communities. U.S. exports to China have been growing at a rate five times faster than any other export market. This growth is primarily driven by increased demand from China for American products and services, including chemicals, components, turbines, telecommunications equipment, drugs, medical devices, and sewage and sanitation equipment.\n\nIf the International Monetary Fund is correct in stating that the U.S. economy is entering a recession with global implications, that impact may be limited by China's economic strength. China's high household savings rate and strong financial reserves have allowed it to withstand economic challenges in the past, such as the 1990s Southeast Asian currency crisis. These factors continue to support China's ability to absorb economic shocks and maintain strong demand for foreign goods. Additionally, a declining U.S. dollar and an appreciating Chinese yuan provide favorable conditions for U.S. exporters.\n\nThe Sichuan earthquake has further emphasized the urgency of China's demand for external resources. As a result, the interests of the United States and China in this context may be aligned, with U.S. exports playing a role in supporting China's recovery efforts while also assisting in job creation and economic stability in the U.S."

        "original_text": "SHANGHAI -- Chinese prosecutors on Friday argued cases against six people accused of involvement in spiking milk with a toxic chemical, in the first trials stemming from a widespread adulteration of dairy products that killed six children and sickened nearly 300,000 others. Police say that one of the accused, Zhang Yujun, produced a mixture of melamine and a starch derivative that he and an associate, Zhang Yanzhang, sold to dairy farmers as \"protein powder.\" Farmers added the powder to milk to make the milk appear higher in protein, in an effort to fool dairy-company quality tests. The melamine-contamination scandal has shaken Chinese people's faith in the safety of the nation's food supply. And the government's legal battle against those responsible appears to be gearing up, as authorities seek to reassure consumers that regulators will protect them. Aggressive prosecutions would send a strong message that the government is serious about product safety. Melamine, an industrial chemical used in plastics and adhesives, mimics the presence of protein in lab tests. Its use in additives mixed into milk became widespread in China. Government checks in September found melamine in baby formula and other milk products sold by more than 20 dairy companies. The chemical can cause kidney ailments and organ failure in humans. Most of those sickened as a result of the adulteration were babies fed formula that contained melamine. Hundreds of children remain hospitalized as a result of the poisoning, according to the health ministry. State television showed Zhang Yujun and Zhang Yanzhang in court Friday, handcuffed, and with their heads bowed as they faced questioning from a panel of three judges. The two men are charged with endangering public security. If convicted they could each face prison terms or the death penalty. Zhang Jinlong, the attorney representing Zhang Yujun, said that his client's \"behavior did jeopardize society and form a crime.\" But, he said, \"We think there can be a more proper charge against him.\" He declined to elaborate. The lawyer said he believes the two defendant Zhangs aren't related to each other. Zhang Yanzhang's attorney couldn't be located for comment. The case is before the Intermediate People's Court in Shijiazhuang, which is home to Shijiazhuang Sanlu Group Co., the dairy company that experienced some of the worst melamine adulteration. Friday's hearing lasted six hours. Unless new evidence is found, there won't be another before the verdict is handed down, Mr. Zhang, the lawyer, said. It's not unusual for hearings in criminal trials in China to last just one day. Legal Daily, a state-run newspaper, reported that Tian Wenhua, the chairwoman and general manager of Sanlu, would stand trial in Shijiazhuang Wednesday for \"selling fake and shoddy products.\" Sanlu earlier this week confirmed that it was bankrupt. The official Xinhua news agency said the company had net outstanding debts of 1.1 billion yuan, or about $160 million. In the case of the Zhangs, police said, Zhang Yujun produced and sold more than 600 hundred tons of melamine-laced powder, beginning in October 2007 and continuing until August 2008. --- Kersten Zhang in Beijing and Ellen Zhu in Shanghai contributed to this article.",
        "debiased_text": "SHANGHAI -- Chinese prosecutors presented cases against six individuals accused of involvement in adding a toxic chemical to milk. This is the first trial related to a widespread contamination of dairy products that resulted in the death of six children and affected nearly 300,000 others. According to police, one of the accused, Zhang Yujun, produced a mixture containing melamine and a starch derivative, which he and an associate, Zhang Yanzhang, sold to dairy farmers as 'protein powder.' Farmers used this powder to increase the apparent protein content of milk, aiming to pass quality tests conducted by dairy companies. The melamine contamination scandal has raised concerns regarding the safety of the Chinese food supply. Authorities are intensifying their legal actions against those responsible in an effort to restore consumer confidence and ensure regulatory protection. Prosecutions are being conducted to demonstrate the government's commitment to product safety. Melamine, an industrial chemical typically used in plastics and adhesives, can mimic protein in laboratory tests. The use of this chemical in additives for milk became common in China. Government inspections in September detected melamine in baby formula and other milk products from over 20 dairy companies. The chemical can lead to kidney issues and organ failure in humans. Most of those affected by the contamination were infants who consumed formula containing melamine. According to the health ministry, hundreds of children are still hospitalized due to the poisoning. State television broadcast images of Zhang Yujun and Zhang Yanzhang in court on Friday, restrained and facing questioning from a panel of three judges. Both are charged with endangering public security and could face prison sentences or the death penalty if convicted. Zhang Jinlong, representing Zhang Yujun, stated that his client's actions did endanger society and constituted a crime, but believes that a more appropriate charge might be applicable. He did not provide further details. Zhang Jinlong also indicated that the two defendants, Zhang Yujun and Zhang Yanzhang, are not related. Zhang Yanzhang's attorney could not be reached for comment. The case is proceeding before the Intermediate People's Court in Shijiazhuang, which is the location of Shijiazhuang Sanlu Group Co., a dairy company that was significantly impacted by the melamine contamination. The hearing on Friday lasted six hours. Unless new evidence arises, there will not be another hearing before the verdict is issued, according to Zhang Jinlong. It is typical for criminal trials in China to have hearings that last only one day. Legal Daily, a state-run newspaper, reported that Tian Wenhua, the chairwoman and general manager of Sanlu, would be on trial in Shijiazhuang on Wednesday for 'selling fake and shoddy products.' Earlier in the week, Sanlu confirmed its bankruptcy status. The official Xinhua news agency indicated that the company had net outstanding debts of 1.1 billion yuan, approximately $160 million. Police stated that Zhang Yujun produced and sold over 600 tons of melamine-laced powder between October 2007 and August 2008."

        "title": "Jeffrey Wasserstrom: Looking at China in literature and the media",
        "original_text": "Due to the Beijing Olympics and a string of unexpected headline-grabbing events, from the Tibet riots and Sichuan earthquake to the melamine milk scandal, this year has seen China garner an extraordinary amount of attention in the western media. There has been a clear contrast even with 2007, when China was also in the news a lot but there were still short periods without international headlines. In 2008, that just didn't happen. If this represents a departure from past precedent, there are two things about English-language discussions of China this year that carried forward ongoing traditions. One represents a disheartening long-term pattern, the other an encouraging recent trend. Let's get the bad news out of the way first. Much western commentary on China, especially as purveyed in media that depend heavily on sound bites and sensationalism, continued to fall into a familiar trap. Simplification of complicated Chinese phenomena was often the order of the day, as much coverage, especially of the Beijing games, swung between romanticising or demonising the country and its people. On the positive side, though, the year saw a bumper crop of unusually illuminating books of reportage. The four works I have in mind take widely varying approaches to contemporary China. What they have in common is that each is by someone with good Chinese language skills, has a long-term commitment to understanding China on its own terms, and has hit upon an interesting way to frame a book. Each offers readers a valuable opportunity to move beyond simplistic visions of China that downplay the diversity of the country and the complex nature of the social and cultural shifts its people are experiencing. Factory Girls by former Wall Street Journal correspondent Leslie T. Chang offers moving life stories and highly individualised portraits of workers the author befriended during visits to the massive industrial boomtown of Dongguan made over several years. The Last Days of Old Beijing, Michael Meyer's poignant, historically minded work, looks at life in a Chinese alleyway neighbourhood slated for destruction. It is based on the former Peace Corp volunteer's extended stay in the district, where he rented a cramped room that lacked indoor plumbing (but had an internet connection) and taught English for free (mostly to the children of migrant labourers) at a local elementary school. Out of Mao's Shadow, a model work of investigative political journalism by the Washington Post's Philip P Pan has many virtues, including that of introducing readers to the work and life of the daring documentary filmmaker Hu Jie and a Sichuan graveyard devoted to victims of Cultural Revolution violence. And finally, Smoke and Mirrors is Pallavi Aiyar's lively set of reflections on her experiences as the first Beijing-based Chinese-speaking correspondent for an Indian daily. Filled with amusing anecdotes, one of its strengths is the author's nuanced assessment of the contrasting attitudes toward manual labour, political expression, and gender in China and India. The appearance in a single year of four books this good—and varied—supports a claim that China specialist Robert Kapp made in a blog posting linked to the reissue of Graham Peck's classic 1950 memoir, Two Kinds of Time. Writing for \"The China Beat\" (an online publication that I helped found), Kapp asserted that we've recently entered a \"second golden age\" of English-language reportage writing on Chinese topics. The \"first golden age,\" in his view, began in the mid-1930s and ended with the appearance of Two Kinds of Time. The era witnessed the publication of many other memorable contributions to the genre, from Emily Hahn's China to Me, Jack Belden's China Shakes the World, and Annalee Jacoby and Theodore White's Thunder Out of China, to multiple titles by Edgar Snow, Agnes Smedley, and Carl Crow. I think Kapp is definitely onto something, even though it is possible to cite impressive works of China reportage that came out during the half-century following the publication of Two Kinds of Time. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, for example, journalists and freelance writers would sometimes follow up trips to or long stays in China by writing smart and stylish books that had important things to say. In the last few years, though, there has been a notable acceleration in how often such books appear. Take 2005: the year saw the publication of Ian Johnson's Wild Grass, a superb work of dissent-focused reportage. Also published that year was The Changing Face of China, the latest in a series of thoughtful books on Chinese themes by long-time Guardian correspondent John Gittings. In 2006, readers who wanted a deeper understanding of China could turn to three impressive books of reportage: Peter Hessler's elegantly turned Oracle Bones: A Journey Between China's Past and Present, John Pomfrett's often moving Chinese Lessons: Five Classmates and the Story of the New China, and James Kynge's wide-ranging China Shakes the World: The Rise of a Hungry Nation. The next year, 2007, was perhaps not quite as rich a year for works of China reportage, but the general trend continued. It saw the appearance of both former Guardian correspondent Duncan Hewitt's Getting Rich First and Rob Gifford's China Road, each of which offered engaging looks at shifts in the PRC between the mid-1980s, when their authors first spent time in the country, and the present. Even measured against the years immediately preceding it, however, this has been a special year. The sheer range of topics covered and varieties of personal experiences the authors bring to their projects makes the \"Class of 2008\" made up of Chang, Meyer, Pan and Aiyar stand out from any that comes to mind from either the first or second \"golden ages\" of the genre. There is also something that makes these publications especially welcome to academics like myself: many of the authors involved, including Ian Johnson and Peter Hessler, find it natural when doing their research to read widely in the historical and social scientific scholarship on the issues that interest them. A final optimistic note is in order. Despite my comments above about the flaws of soundbite-driven discussions of China in 2008, throughout the year some excellent reporting on and commentaries about the country appeared in English-language publications, including The Guardian's print edition and Comment is Free. It could easily turn out that some of the most talented writers in the latest crop of savvy and thoughtful China-based journalists—people like the New Yorker's Evan Osnos—will end up coming up with book project as original and interesting as those of the Class of 2008. If so, the \"second golden age\" of reportage that Kapp imagined could continue for some time to come.",
        "debiased_text": "In 2008, China received significant attention in Western media due to the Beijing Olympics and several notable events, including incidents in Tibet, the Sichuan earthquake, and a milk scandal involving melamine. This level of attention contrasts with 2007, a year also marked by frequent coverage of China in the media, but with occasional periods lacking major international headlines. Despite the increased media focus, two ongoing trends in English-language discussions of China persisted. One trend involved the simplification of complex Chinese phenomena in media that often relies on sound bites and tends toward sensationalism, with coverage frequently oscillating between romanticizing or criticizing China and its people. On the other hand, 2008 saw the release of several notable books on China, each employing different approaches to contemporary Chinese issues. These books were written by authors with strong Chinese language skills and lengthy commitments to understanding China in depth, offering nuanced perspectives on the country's diversity and social and cultural transformations. Examples include 'Factory Girls' by Leslie T. Chang, 'The Last Days of Old Beijing' by Michael Meyer, 'Out of Mao's Shadow' by Philip P. Pan, and 'Smoke and Mirrors' by Pallavi Aiyar. Robert Kapp, a China specialist, suggested in a blog post that 2008 marked a 'second golden age' of English-language reportage on China, contrasting with the 'first golden age' of the mid-1930s that ended with the publication of Graham Peck's memoir, 'Two Kinds of Time.' Kapp noted that while the first golden age saw many important works, the second golden age is evidenced by a recent uptick in quality reportage on China. For instance, 2005 saw the publication of 'Wild Grass' by Ian Johnson and 'The Changing Face of China' by John Gittings. In 2006, notable books such as 'Oracle Bones' by Peter Hessler, 'Chinese Lessons' by John Pomfrett, and 'China Shakes the World: The Rise of a Hungry Nation' by James Kynge were released. 2007 also saw several important works, including 'Getting Rich First' by Duncan Hewitt and 'China Road' by Rob Gifford. The Class of 2008, consisting of Chang, Meyer, Pan, and Aiyar, stands out for the variety of topics and personal experiences presented. Additionally, many of these authors engage with historical and social science scholarship as part of their research, which is appreciated by academics. Finally, despite the shortcomings in sound bite-driven reporting, 2008 featured several quality reports and commentaries in English-language publications, including The Guardian and Comment is Free. It is possible that talented writers such as Evan Osnos from The New Yorker may soon contribute original and compelling works, suggesting the 'second golden age' of reportage might continue."

        "title": "Iraq: a conflict arising from the emergence of China?",
        "original_text": "Neoconservatives and hardline nationalists in the US wanted to invade Iraq for three reasons - it was an established bogeyman in US minds, it would be an easy target, and it would provide a potential base from which the US could permanently dominate the Gulf region and, if need be, deny oil to China. In sum, the US invasion was not driven by Middle East considerations at all - it had more to do with the emergence of China. That is the interesting theory at the start of Gwynne Dyer's book After Iraq: what next for the Middle East? Published to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, the book is concise, incisive and thoroughly entertaining. At times, despite the serious subject matter, it is laugh out loud funny because of its irreverent style, not least in the way it debunks what pass for established facts. Take Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's call for Israel to be wiped off his map. Dyer points the reader to a translation of the 2006 speech by Juan Cole, a professor and respected blogger, who offers this version of the offending statement: \"The imam said that this regime occupying Jerusalem must [vanish from] the pages of time\". For Dyer, what Ahmadinejad was calling for was an end to the \"Zionist regime\" in Israel, not for the extermination of the Jewish people. With opinions like this, it is no wonder that Conrad Black, the former media magnate now in jail, dropped Dyer's column from the Jerusalem Post and other Canadian publications he owned. Dyer, a Canadian academic turned journalist, has little time for the fashionable theory of the \"Shia crescent\" or the fear of Shia expansion in the Arab world at the expense of the majority Sunnis now Shias dominate Iraq as well as Iran. The notion of an Iranian military threat to the Arab world belongs to the realm of fantasy. The regional balance of power has shifted and Iran has much more weight than it used to, but this does not mean that Iranian armoured divisions will soon be racing across the Fertile Crescent and seizing the Arab oil fields on the Arab side of the Gulf. For one thing, Iranian armoured divisions do not race; they move at an arthritic crawl ... for another why would Iran want to rule some tens of millions of rebellious Arabs and a bunch of burning oil fields. Dyer believes the US has lost the war in Iraq and will soon be pulling out, notwithstanding any success from the troop \"surge\". Getting out of Iraq, he argues, is the least bad thing for the US - and the sooner the better. He sees a serious possibility that the US will not only retreat from Iraq, but very substantially reduce its military presence in the entire Middle East - \"not necessarily a Bad Thing for the region, or the world\". The Middle East desperately needs change from its stagnant state, which is not solely the fault of the US, Dyer says, but American presence and policies have upheld the status quo of authoritarian and corrupt regimes. But what about the Islamists waiting in the wings? Dyer does not believe Arabs will vote for radical Islamists if there is political liberalisation. \"Arabs are not fools, and most find it hard to believe that the solutions to all their problems were quite as simple as the Islamists contend,\" he argues. The one place where they had a whiff of success was Algeria, where elections were cancelled when it looked as though Islamists would win. During the ensuing civil war, the Islamists' barbaric tactics and extreme ideas turned popular opinion against them.",
        "debiased_text": "Neoconservatives and hardline nationalists in the US considered invading Iraq for several reasons, including its status as a perceived threat, its vulnerability as a target, and its strategic location in the Gulf region. Gwynne Dyer's book, 'After Iraq: What Next for the Middle East?', published around the fifth anniversary of the invasion, presents a theory that the invasion was more influenced by concerns related to the rise of China than by Middle East-specific considerations. The book is described as concise, incisive, and entertaining, incorporating a humorous tone at times due to its irreverent writing style. It challenges commonly accepted narratives, such as the interpretation of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's 2006 speech regarding Israel, where Dyer references a translation by Juan Cole, a professor and blogger, suggesting that the statement called for an end to the 'Zionist regime' rather than the extermination of the Jewish people. Dyer's views reportedly led Conrad Black, a former media magnate currently incarcerated, to remove Dyer's column from publications such as the Jerusalem Post. Dyer, who transitioned from academia to journalism, criticizes the 'Shia crescent' theory, which suggests a growing Shia influence in the Arab world that could undermine Sunni dominance. He argues that the idea of an Iranian military threat to the Arab world is largely speculative, stating that Iran's military capabilities are limited and that it has no clear strategic interest in governing large populations of restless Arabs or controlling oil fields. Dyer believes that the US has not achieved success in Iraq and will likely withdraw from the country, regardless of any outcomes from the troop 'surge'. He considers this withdrawal to be the least unfavorable option for the US and suggests that the region may benefit from a reduced American military presence. Dyer acknowledges that the Middle East requires significant changes to its stagnant political state, which is not solely attributed to US involvement, but notes that American policies and presence have supported the continuation of authoritarian and corrupt regimes. He also discusses the potential for Islamist movements, but argues that most Arabs do not support the radical solutions proposed by Islamists. An exception to this view is Algeria, where the potential for Islamist victory led to the cancellation of elections, followed by a civil war that resulted in a shift of public opinion against the Islamists due to their extreme tactics and ideas."

For the past six years, representatives of Tibet's spirit-ual leader have been engaged in talks with the Chinese government, hoping that Beijing will recognise the Tibetans' distinct culture, language and identity within the People's Republic. But in spite of hopes this year that China might relax its stance, those talks have broken down. China today refuses to enter into any discussion about Tibet's status within the PRC, accusing the Dalai Lama of covertly seeking full-blown separation. The Dalai Lama has, in turn, expressed disappointment with this stance, warning that Beijing's wish to strike an accord is \"thinning, thinning, thinning\". As a result, hundreds of Tibetans from communities around the world have this week gathered for an unprecedented meeting in the Indian hill town of Dharamsala. They are discussing what course the Tibetan movement should take next. The Dharamsala meeting de-serves attention. For decades, the Da-lai Lama has been a renowned voice of moderation. But as he ad-mitted in a Financial Times interview in May, the failure of his moderate stance to yield results is alienating younger Tibetans. An opinion survey reveals that a sizeable number of Tibetans want full-blown independence - and many of them want the Dalai Lama's peaceful \"middle way\" abandoned. They argue that next March, when Tibet marks the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's flight into exile, there must be another demonstration of resistance to the Chinese authorities. The hope must be that the Dalai Lama's insistence on moderation is reasserted this week, and that the Tibetan resistance movement does not shift to aggressive militancy. But if that is to be realised, China must reconsider the ruthlessness with which it treats calls for Tibetan autonomy. The Chinese government regards the Nobel laureate as a charismatic figure with whom it is difficult to do business. But a successful negotiation with him is the only way to ensure a peaceful outcome to this stand-off. Beijing seems to believe that if the Dalai Lama disappears, the problem of Tibet will disappear with him. That is a serious miscalculation.",

During this meeting, they are discussing the future direction of the Tibetan movement. The Dalai Lama has historically been seen as a moderate voice. However, in a Financial Times interview in May, he acknowledged that his moderate approach has not produced results and is causing a rift with younger Tibetans. An opinion survey indicates that a significant portion of Tibetans desire full independence and are considering abandoning the Dalai Lama's non-violent 'middle way' approach. Some participants at the Dharamsala meeting believe that a demonstration of resistance should occur next March, which marks the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's exile. There is a hope that the Dalai Lama will reinforce his position of moderation and that the Tibetan movement will avoid moving toward militancy. For this to happen, China must reassess its response to calls for Tibetan autonomy. China views the Dalai Lama, a Nobel laureate, as a charismatic individual with whom negotiations are challenging. However, a successful dialogue with him is considered essential for achieving a peaceful resolution to the current situation. The Chinese government appears to believe that the absence of the Dalai Lama would eliminate the issue of Tibet, but this is seen as a significant error."

        "title": "Mining firms: China's stake in Rio Tinto gets all-clear from Australia",
        "original_text": "The Australian government has approved the Chinese acquisition of a stake in the mining group Rio Tinto, potentially throwing an obstacle in the path of BHP Billiton's £70bn bid for the company. Chinalco, in partnership with the American mining group Alcoa, spent £7bn to become Rio Tinto's largest shareholder in February. The acquisition of 12% of Rio Tinto's London shares was the biggest single foreign investment made by a Chinese company to date and had to overcome serious political concerns in Canberra. In a statement released yesterday the Australian treasurer, Wayne Swan, said he would allow the Chinese company to buy as much as 14.99% of Rio Tinto's London shares. Rio Tinto has a dual listing in Sydney and a 14.99% stake in London would equate to around 11% in the entire group. But he set two conditions; that Chinalco does not raise its stake above that level without fresh approval from the Australian government and that it will not seek to appoint a director to the Rio Tinto board as long as its stake remains below 15%. It is debatable whether Chinalco will feel bound by the conditions. In an interview in June, Chinalco president Xiao Yaqing suggested that the company did not need Canberra's approval because it had bought the shares in London. Chinalco's swoop on Rio Tinto was widely regarded as an attempt to block the BHP bid rather than a precursor to its own takeover attempt. Beijing is said to fear that a merger of BHP and Rio Tinto would spark an increase in the price of raw materials. A combined BHP and Rio Tinto would be worth £170bn and control about 35% of the world's traded iron ore. BHP Billiton chief executive Marius Kloppers has played down the significance of the Chinese stake in Rio Tinto. BHP made its hostile all-share offer conditional on only 50% acceptances, which means it is not necessarily reliant on the support of Chinalco. But Stephen Bartrop, a resources analyst at Stock Resource in Sydney, told Bloomberg that the Chinese stake in Rio Tinto \"creates uncertainty about whether or not BHP will get its deal over the line\". The west has been wary about the growing financial clout of China, with governments scrutinising deals for political intent. In the United States, a Chinese company was allowed to take over the personal computer business of IBM, but another, CNOOC, was blocked from buying oil company Unocal. The Australian government recently blocked the Chinese steelmaker Shougang from buying a 20% stake in Perth-based iron ore producer Mount Gibson. A Chinese bid for the Canadian aluminium group Noranda was also scuppered by political objections. Swan said the conditions imposed upon Chinalco would be sufficient to protect Australia's national interests. BHP is awaiting regulatory approval before sending out its offer document. Washington has already given its approval while Europe is expected to rule by December 9. Australian regulators will give their final verdict in October.",

        "original_text": "Beijing -- Investors who follow the old axiom \"buy on rumor, sell on fact\" when trading shares in China's telecommunications sector have been getting burned. A series of speculative reports saying long-awaited industry restructuring is imminent have triggered waves of buying in shares of China's big telecom operators. Then, generally, the buying has been quickly followed by waves of selling, erasing short-term rises in share prices. Analysts who follow the sector say the actual restructuring is at least eight months away. They say there are potentially good picks among the four listed carriers -- China Mobile Ltd., China Unicom Ltd., China Telecom Corp. and China Netcom Group Corp. (Hong Kong) Ltd. -- all of which trade in both New York and Hong Kong. But they advise investors to focus on the fundamentals and think long term, rather than chase buzz about timing. \"People should not be trading around these rumors,\" says Eric Wen, head of Chinese telecom and Internet coverage at BNP Paribas in Shanghai. The latest round of speculation came last Friday, when unconfirmed reports that the restructuring plan had been finalized caused Hong Kong shares in Unicom to jump nearly 7%. The Ministry of Information Industry, which regulates the sector, as well as representatives for the Chinese operators denied any new restructuring developments. Unicom shares have since lost all of Friday's gains. Analysts in Beijing say the government is likely to wait until after the Olympics in August to initiate the restructuring. Liu Bin, an analyst at technology consultant BDA China Ltd., says the changes might be discussed during the annual session of China's legislature, the National People's Congress, in March. He says the restructuring is unlikely before summer because carriers need stable operations to guarantee good service for the Games. When it does come, the restructuring is likely to cause sweeping change. The industry is now divided among two wireless carriers, China Mobile and China Unicom, plus two big fixed-line carriers, China Telecom and China Netcom, that have long struggled with the defection of their customers to wireless service. The government owns controlling stakes in all four carriers. Analysts generally agree on the broad strokes of the coming restructuring. They expect the government to break up China Unicom -- which now operates two different types of wireless networks -- and join its assets to the two fixed-line carriers. That would let China Telecom and China Netcom compete in the wireless sector with China Mobile, the world's largest mobile carrier by number of subscribers. Michael Meng, a Citigroup analyst, wrote in a report Friday that Unicom, with a market capitalization of about US$28 billion, was undervalued. The total value works out to $234 a subscriber, which he said is the lowest figure in the Asian-Pacific region. With a \"buy\" rating, Mr. Meng set a 12-month target for Unicom stock of 22 Hong Kong dollars (US$2.82). Yesterday, a day on which Hong Kong stocks tumbled, shares of China Unicom fell 3.1% to HK$17.48. The Citigroup analyst has a \"buy\" on China Mobile. With 362.8 million subscribers, the company claims 67% of the world's largest population of 540 million cellphone users. Wendy Liu, an analyst for ABN Amro in Hong Kong, expects it will take time for China Mobile's competition to improve. She has a 12- month target of HK$200 for the shares, which fell 4.1% to HK$124.80. --- Zhou Yang in Beijing and Bai Lin in Shanghai contributed to this article. Enlarge this image.",

        "title": "Could this documentary make a difference for Tibet?",
        "original_text": "Tibet's 'God King': the Dalai Lama. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th and current Dalai Lama of Tibet, says in the trailer for Joshua Dugdale's new documentary, The Unwinking Gaze, that there are people who feel the Dalai Lama has \"some kind of miracle power\". But this Dalai Lama makes it clear he has no such power. He understands change can come for Tibet only when enough caring people have received his message of peace, so he's never shied away from manipulating the media to spread the word. He's embraced the ways of the modern world in an attempt to achieve one of mankind's oldest goals. Dugdale followed the Dalai Lama for 18 months, recording the \"God King\"'s struggle to balance his Buddhist teachings with the realities of negotiating a lasting settlement with China - a task that's grown even more urgent with the recent deadly riots in Lhasa. Dugdale hopes The Unwinking Gaze's release will convince Beijing to invite the Dalai Lama to attend the 2008 Olympic Games, which could be an important step toward resolving this increasingly tense issue. Dugdale feels the film will cause \"shockwaves\", thus embarrassing China into making an opening gesture of resolution. Is this too optimistic a position? Many people contend that Hearts and Minds, Peter Davis's searing 1974 documentary about the Vietnam War, hastened the US's withdrawal from Cambodia. But 2008 isn't 1974. These days, if your shockwaves don't reverberate through two or three news cycles, you're likely to be trumped by whichever starlet is currently snorting coke or exiting a vehicle minus her knickers. We may have reached the point where a compelling documentary alone is incapable of rattling us from our slumber. But I think the riots, as unfortunate as they are, will work in Dugdale's favour - and, ultimately, in favour of Tibet. When coupled with media coverage of recent events, The Unwinking Gaze could actually generate change. Although I felt much differently about the film's chances of making an impact a scant two weeks ago, now I suspect it could force China into a more civil, humanitarian stance toward Tibet. True believers in the power of cinema should keep an eye on this one. How wonderful to think that a mere movie could once again help make a difference.",

Dugdale suggests that the film could cause 'shockwaves' and possibly pressure China into making a gesture of resolution. Whether this expectation is overly optimistic remains a topic of debate, as some argue that a documentary's influence may be limited in the current media landscape. The recent riots, although unfortunate, may provide an opportunity for the film to contribute to change, especially when combined with media coverage of current events. The potential impact of the documentary on China's stance toward Tibet is now being reconsidered."

        "title": "Asia: Indian economy to rival China's industrial powerhouse, according to top policy tsar",
        "original_text": "The Indian economy will expand at 8% a year - shrugging off the credit crunch and high oil prices - as it is transformed into an industrial powerhouse to rival China, the government's top policy tsar said yesterday. He predicted that Chinese-style 10% annual growth was \"achievable\". Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chief of India's planning commission, said the government would be \"targeting 9% growth, getting up to 10%. It may look ambitious with the global economic slowdown. But in the medium term, it is achievable.\" India's central bank expects growth in the year ending 2009 to slow to 8% - down from 9.1% in the previous 12 months. The commission has signalled a huge shift in the economy - forecasting that in the next five years 58m new jobs will be created but none of these would be in the vast, unproductive farm sector. In the past five years farming employment increased by 9 million while India's rice production remained less than half the world average of four tonnes a hectare. Economists have long argued that for India to mimic China's \"long boom\", the country would have to see industry fuel growth. In China, this led to millions of people leaving the land to work in factories. But this process has not happened in India, where growth has been driven by capital-intensive sectors such as information technology. Although hugely successful, Indian software companies employ only 1.5 million people - a mere drop in the labour pool of 470 million. However, the planning commission says that in the next five years the bulk of new jobs will be created in factories, construction sites, restaurants, retail stores and warehouses. Many commentators say the country is at a turning point. \"I think as labour costs rise in China and there's a price to pay for pollution that we will see manufacturing coming to India,\" said Niranjan Rajadhyaksha, a columnist with the business daily Mint. \"There's been for some time a sense that agriculture can no longer absorb any more people.\" Others, however, dispute the commission's analysis, saying that Indian business has \"voted with their wallets\" by expanding abroad faster than at home. Foreign investors on India's stockmarket have also been withdrawing funds as the world economic downturn has begun to bite. Mohan Guruswamy of the Centre for Policy Alternatives said: \"India has become a net exporter of FDI [foreign direct investment]. That's because it is too difficult to start up labour-intensive manufacturing of the kind you find in China. Sixty per cent of Indians depend on agriculture and I don't see that changing.\" The commission has also produced a plan to \"engage with 10 high-growth sectors\" in manufacturing. If these projections are met they would see India's car industry employ 25 million people by 2015 and produce exports of $145bn (£77.5bn). Similarly, the textile sector would have almost 42 million workers and be taking $115bn in overseas orders. Most dramatic, however, is the coming transformation of India from a software to hardware superpower. The commission says in less than a decade it is looking for exports of $320bn in \"chip manufacture ... design and mechanical assembly line operations\". \"The hardware [estimate] seems optimistic. The auto industry seems in the right area,\" said Shankar Acharya, former chief economic adviser to the government. \"The important question here is what kind of jobs are created. In the past it has been low-security and low-paid jobs in what is called the informal sector. That needs to change.\" Economic growth: Closing the gap The big question for many economists is why the Indian economy has not matched the fast pace of growth enjoyed by China in the past 20 years. China was set on the road to rapid industrialisation in 1978 when the then premier Deng Xiaoping introduced free market reforms and measures to encourage foreign investment. In recent years the economy has expanded at a rate of 10% a year with industrial production increasing by 17% annually. India, on the other hand, has not created such an established and stable manufacturing base. China joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001 and exports account for more than a quarter of GDP. The booming economy has, however, led to fears about inflation and rising wage rates. The stockmarket has slumped by 62% since its peak last October with exporters hit by the global downturn. Some predictions suggest inflation will reach 8-9% this year.",
        "debiased_text": "The Indian government's deputy chief of the planning commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, stated yesterday that the Indian economy is expected to grow at 8% annually, despite challenges such as a credit crunch and high oil prices. He indicated that a 10% annual growth rate, similar to that of China, is considered achievable. The commission has projected the creation of 58 million new jobs over the next five years, none of which are expected to be in the agricultural sector. In the past five years, employment in farming increased by 9 million, while India's rice production has remained below half of the world average of four tonnes per hectare. Some economists suggest that for India to achieve sustained growth, the industrial sector must be the primary driver. In contrast to China, where millions of people transitioned from agriculture to manufacturing, India has seen growth mainly in capital-intensive industries like information technology. Indian software companies currently employ 1.5 million people, which is a small fraction of the total labour pool of 470 million. The planning commission has outlined plans to develop 10 high-growth sectors in manufacturing, including the automobile and textile industries. If these projections are realized, the auto industry could employ 25 million people by 2015 and generate $145 billion in exports, while the textile industry might employ 42 million workers and receive $115 billion in overseas orders. The commission also foresees India becoming a significant player in hardware manufacturing, with export projections of $320 billion in chip manufacturing, design, and mechanical assembly operations within a decade. Shankar Acharya, former chief economic adviser to the government, expressed doubt regarding the hardware projections, suggesting that the auto industry might be more realistic. He emphasized the need for creating secure and well-paid jobs in formal sectors. Many analysts question why the Indian economy has not achieved the same rapid growth as China over the past 20 years. China initiated its growth trajectory in 1978 with market reforms and foreign investment incentives. In recent years, China's economy has grown at a 10% annual rate, with industrial production increasing by 17% each year. India has not yet established a similarly robust and stable manufacturing base. China's accession to the World Trade Organisation in 2001 has resulted in exports accounting for more than a quarter of its GDP. However, the rapid economic growth has raised concerns regarding inflation and rising wage rates. The Indian stock market has declined by 62% from its peak in October, with exporters affected by the global economic downturn. Some forecasts predict inflation may reach between 8% and 9% this year."

Germany's share is up 5 percent, while France, Japan and the United States have steadily slipped--minus 10, 25 and 30 percent, respectively. The United States now represents some 8.6 percent of global exports, up from 12 percent in 2006. Germany's share rose from 8.5 to 9.4, and China's from 3.8 to 8.1. While other Western countries worry about a slowdown, Germany seems to be chugging right along. In November, the country's machinery producers' association--which accounts for one third of German exports--revised 2007 production numbers upward, showing the sector growing by 15 percent, the fastest rate since 1969. Fresh auto-industry numbers show exports racing ahead by 11 percent in 2007; the sector has boosted employment by 20 percent, or 160,000 workers, since 1995, while the number of jobs dependent on exports has gone up from 5.9 million in 1995 to 8.3 million workers today. With other manufacturing sectors like trains, turbines and chemicals also surging, economists have recently begun to talk about the \"reindustrialization of Germany\" and a \"second economic miracle.\" It's a miracle that is based largely on the success of the very countries that were supposed to undermine Germany--emerging markets with cheap manufacturing labor. Rather than undercutting German manufacturers, these nations have actually bolstered them, as their new middle classes buy more German cars and local factories shell out for topnotch German heavy machinery. These are sectors where German companies have long been strong, and have been gaining competitiveness vis-Ã -vis other Western countries. It's a trend evidenced by the fact that it was Germany, not China, that in 2003 passed the United States to become the world's leading exporter of merchandise; in 2006 German companies shipped $1.11 trillion worth of products abroad, versus America's $1.04 trillion and China's $969 billion. (If you add services, the United States remains slightly ahead.) All this belies the idea that globalization was supposed to make life near impossible for an Old Economy, high-wage country like Germany. The future was to belong to high tech and services, not old-fashioned manufacturing. But this conventional wisdom is being upended by the Germans, who may offer something of a model for other developed economies. As neighbors watched in some wonder, German companies regained the competitiveness they lost in the early 1990s. Smart deals with unions, for example, helped big exporters such as BMW and Siemens lower wage costs by about 15 percent relative to competitors in other major exporting countries like France. While Germany's labor market remains ossified by overregulation, the legalization of temporary workers in the 1990s also helped companies become more flexible. But that's only the well-known part of the story. Much less familiar are the global trends that German companies have been able to leverage in their favor. First and foremost is the Return of the Old Economy. Contrary to popular belief, it's not IT or made-in-China consumer goods that have driven world economic growth since the turn of the millennium. That's because the 1990s boom in IT--which benefited countries like the United States and Japan--has fizzled as prices for tech hardware have fallen. Similarly, services have been stagnating at roughly one fifth of world trade for years. Instead, there has been an unprecedented surge of equipment-buying in emerging economies, as countries from China and Russia to the Middle East build factories, upgrade transportation and improve infrastructure--a trend economists expect will last years, if not decades. Developing and transition countries have accounted for more than a third of German export growth since 1995, and in 2006 Germany even managed to run an â,¬11 billion trade surplus with these countries--â,¬21 billion if energy suppliers like Russia and Kazakhstan are factored out. Even as other Western countries have shrunk their industrial sectors, Germans have been expanding market share vis-Ã -vis their rivals in these strongly growing areas. That's the main reason Germany's manufacturing-heavy DAX Index soared 22 percent in 2007, 18 points more than the S&P 500 and Britain's FTSE, 21 points more than France's CAC 40, and 33 points more than Japan's Nikkei. Behind the gains were export powerhouses such as carmaker Volkswagen (up 82 percent) and industrial conglomerate Siemens (up 44 percent). \"China may be the world's factory,\" says Hermann Simon, CEO of a German consultancy advising exporters. \"But German companies are building it.\" And they're finding it quite profitable to do all that building at home. The second global trend contradicting the familiar public debate over globalization and outsourcing is the way companies increasingly compete on quality, not just on price. \"We all expected China to move into certain sectors, forcing Germany to specialize in something else,\" says Yale trade specialist Peter Schott. Instead, economists have been astonished to see German companies stay put and even thrive, as they compete in the same products as China. The obvious conclusion, says Schott, is that more-expensive German goods have something customers want, such as better quality or services like lifetime maintenance, systems integration and upgrades. That's why Germany dominates the global markets for exotic factory machines from cocoa processors and carton creasers to warp knitters and lipstick fillers (in each of these niches, a single German company controls 70 percent or more of the global market). The new view, says Schott, is that as long as German workers stay up on quality, they can insulate themselves from Chinese competition. One indication that German companies aren't waiting for China to catch up is that the premium customers are willing to pay for German products has been steadily rising. Germany's export prices to the United States, the world's largest importer, have risen twice as fast as China's since the late 1990s, even as Americans order more German products. In France, Germany's biggest export market, the German premium has risen even faster even as exports have gone up. Schott says that the widening price gap reflects quality upgrading, as German firms specialize in ever-more sophisticated versions of products. Take Dorma, the world's leading manufacturer of what seems, at first glance, a lowly and exchangeable product: door locks, hinges and glass walls. Yet it's one of Germany's fastest-growing global companies, delivering to construction sites from Shanghai to Dubai. How does Dorma beat out dozens of cheaper rivals? The â,¬700 million-a-year firm is one of Germany's top-50 patent holders and one of the very few firms capable of installing the complex security systems to go with its door hardware for Ã¼ber -projects such as the 160-floor Burj Dubai. This isn't just about making the best locks, but about having the top security software, and the best project managers. Similarly, WÃ¼rth has turned distributing screws, bolts and construction hardware into a â,¬7 billion-a-year global empire growing at a China-like rate of 12 percent for more than a decade. The product may be low-tech and replicable, says CEO Robert Friedmann, but no competitor can handle 24/7 product queries in 86 countries. These seemingly old-fashioned yet secretly innovative midsize companies, as well as larger manufacturers like Siemens and Daimler, are at the heart of something like a New Knowledge Economy. Automakers like BMW and car-component specialists like Bosch churn out an estimated two thirds of the global auto industry's innovations, according to data from Oliver Wyman, a consultancy specializing in manufacturing. Germany may not be at the forefront of university-based research, says JÃ¼rgen Matthes, an economist at the Institute of the German Economy in Cologne. \"But our machinery and auto industries take the IT others have developed and find innovative ways to embed it in our products.\" A recent study by Germany's Fraunhofer Institute shows German manufacturers (which represent 90 percent of the nation's R&D spending) are introducing new products at a rate we usually expect from the IT sector. Machinery makers, for example, make one third of their revenue from products on the market for fewer than three years. \"What these companies specialize in might not be high-tech in the conventional sense, but they're among the most complex things you can imagine,\" says Thomas Kautzsch, machine-industry consultant at Oliver Wyman in Munich. As a result, says Kautzsch, there are dozens of niche sectors where German companies have innovated their competitors right out of the market. Case in point: Herrenknecht, a one-man engineering business in the 1960s, now practically owns the global market for the complex heavy machinery used to dig tunnels. It's using its digging expertise to expand into geothermal energy--another rapidly expanding sector. Coupling their wares with high-tech products and services is another clever way many German manufacturers are successfully removing themselves from low-wage competition. Claas delivers the farm-management software to go with its harvesters and offers consulting in biofuels. Schmitz Cargobull, Europe's leading manufacturer of trailers, has added a financing unit, lifetime service contracts and GPS cargo monitoring, all of which are providing an increasing share of revenues. Factory builders like Voith, the world's biggest builder of paper-production plants, or DÃ¼rr, which supplies the painting units to many of the world's car plants, also plan construction, train workers, service equipment and supply upgrades--usually with a global service network that minimizes costly shutdowns. The result is also a package no Chinese upstart supplier can match without investing billions, Simon says. Economists call it an \"entry barrier.\" For companies like Voith and DÃ¼rr, it secures profits and jobs. The German boom appears surprisingly resilient. Last week figures for November industrial orders surprised economists expecting a slowdown, showing a year-on-year gain of 13.6 percent. So far, neither the superstrong euro nor the subprime debacle seems to have dented German industrial prowess. Surging exports account for 80 percent of German GDP growth since 2000, helping the country outgrow neighbors such as France (2.5 vs. 1.8 percent in 2007, 2.9 vs. 2.0 in 2006). Now that export successes are feeding into the larger economy via rising employment and wage hikes, economists say rising domestic consumption could help buffer a potential global slowdown in 2008. Outsourcing to cheaper locations such as Eastern Europe has come to a halt, says Matthes, and some companies are returning production home. Fraunhofer has identified 3,500 firms in the machine and chemical industries that have returned offshored production since 2000, often citing quality problems, logistical costs or disruptive employee-turnover rates in places like China. \"We don't outsource, we in-source,\" explains Bernd Hoffmann, chairman of Schmitz Cargobull. Neighbors like France are watching closely. In France, President Nicolas Sarkozy is embroiled in a debate over how to gain back the competitiveness the French economy has lost in recent years. \"The gap between France and Germany has grown,\" says FrÃ©dÃ©rique Sachwald, an economist at the French Ministry of Research. \"French companies have been slower to control costs and innovate.\" Because of past protectionism, she says, they have been less exposed than their German rivals to the competitive pressures of global trade. The competing model for creating growth, a U.S.-style focus on high-tech innovation and entrepreneurial \"creative destruction\" would require large-scale changes as well. Whether countries like France look for Germany or America as a model, however, the present focus of French government planners--protecting national champions--is exactly the wrong policy, concludes a November report by Bruegel, a Brussels think tank, comparing the French and German export industries. That's not to say that Germany's gung-ho export model is a cure-all, even at home. While the manufacturing dominance of the German economy is growing, total manufacturing jobs have only lately registered a small uptick. Because of a dramatic weeding out of uncompetitive companies and products, the share of factory labor shrank from 40 percent of the work force in 1990 to 20 percent today. The new mean, lean, tech-heavy factories need not hordes of low-skilled laborers, but highly skilled specialists and engineers who are in short supply, which is already cutting into growth at many exporters. Government policy could make matters worse. After decades of fruitless debate over migration policy, the country remains all but shut off to skilled immigrants. Lately, Angela Merkel's leftward-leaping ruling coalition has been discussing plans to crack down on temporary employment, which would strip German companies of some of the flexibility that's helped them regain competitiveness in recent years. The biggest danger, of course, is the possibility of continued financial turmoil--or a recession in the United States putting a brake on global growth. Already, inflationary pressures that are part and parcel of this trouble are making German consumers (always hypersensitive to inflation) more tightfisted. But even as they pinch pennies, German companies are struggling to keep up with a surge in orders. There's no doubt that a sustained downturn in the United States (their No. 2 export market) could change that two-track picture, pulling overall German growth down much farther. Yet, as long as China and other key emerging markets can balance things out, Germany's re-energized Old Economy may stay one of globalization's biggest winners for a long time to come.",
        "debiased_text": "The Lexion, a combine harvester manufactured by Claas GmbH in Harsewinkel, Germany, is equipped with satellite and laser optics for precision-guided operation. It has a capacity to harvest 60 metric tons of grain per hour and incorporates real-time sensors that measure yield per square meter, adjusting seed and fertilizer usage for the next season. The Lexion costs approximately €400,000, which is 33 percent more than the leading competitor's top model. Despite the higher price, demand from large agricultural operators in countries such as Russia and Australia has been significant, leading to a backlog of orders at the Harsewinkel plant extending into 2009.\n\nClaas GmbH, a company with annual revenues of €2.7 billion, is not concerned about competition from China. Theo Freye, the chairman of the company, stated that innovation ensures their continued success. Germany and China are the only major economies that have increased their share of global exports since the year 2000. Germany's share has risen by 5 percent, while France, Japan, and the United States have experienced declines of 10, 25, and 30 percent respectively. As of the latest data, the United States accounts for 8.6 percent of global exports, with a decrease from 12 percent in 2006. Germany's share increased from 8.5 to 9.4 percent, and China's rose from 3.8 to 8.1 percent.\n\nIn November 2007, the machinery producers' association in Germany revised the production figures for that year upwards, indicating a 15 percent growth rate, the fastest since 1969. The automobile industry has also seen a 11 percent growth in its exports during the same year. Employment in the auto industry has risen by 20 percent, or 160,000 jobs, since 1995. The number of workers dependent on exports has increased from 5.9 million in 1995 to 8.3 million currently.\n\nOther industrial sectors such as trains, turbines, and chemicals have also recorded significant growth. Economists have started discussing the phenomenon as a 'reindustrialization of Germany' and a potential 'second economic miracle.' This trend has been supported by the increasing export demand from emerging economies. These countries have contributed more than a third of Germany's export growth since 1995. In 2006, Germany achieved an €11 billion trade surplus with these emerging economies, and an additional €21 billion surplus when excluding energy suppliers such as Russia and Kazakhstan.\n\nMeanwhile, the German export sector, particularly companies such as Volkswagen and Siemens, has managed to secure a larger market share in the areas of significant growth relative to their Western counterparts. According to Hermann Simon, CEO of a German consultancy advising exporters, German companies may be playing an essential role in building China's manufacturing capabilities. He added that German companies have found it profitable to conduct business within Germany.\n\nAnother trend is that companies are increasingly competing based on the quality of their goods rather than just price. Yale trade specialist Peter Schott noted that while there were expectations for China to move into some sectors and push Germany towards specialization in others, German companies have managed to thrive in the same product lines as China. He stated that the increasing price premium that customers are willing to pay for German products reflects a shift toward higher-quality offerings, such as better product quality, extended maintenance services, and system upgrades.\n\nThis is demonstrated by companies such as Dorma, one of the leading global manufacturers of door locks, hinges, and glass walls, which delivers to construction sites from Shanghai to Dubai. Dorma is among the top-50 patent holders in Germany and is capable of installing complex security systems for projects like the 160-floor Burj Dubai. Similarly, Würth, a company that distributes screws, bolts, and construction hardware, has grown into a global enterprise with an annual turnover of €7 billion.\n\nThis growth is also attributed to the ways in which companies are integrating high-tech products and services in a manner that differentiates them from low-wage competitors. Claas, for instance, provides accompanying farm-management software and offers consulting in biofuels. Schmitz Cargobull, Europe’s leading trailer manufacturer, has expanded into financing, life service contracts, and GPS cargo monitoring, which now contribute significantly to its revenue.\n\nVoith and Dür, which are among the leading factory builders and car painting unit suppliers, also incorporate planning, worker training, servicing, and providing upgrades within their operations, while maintaining a global service network aimed at minimizing costly shutdowns. These services are considered difficult for emerging markets to replicate without significant investment.\n\nGermany's industrial output remains robust, despite concerns about the potential impact of a strong euro and financial crises. Industrial orders recorded a November year-on-year increase of 13.6 percent, surpassing economic predictions for a slowdown. Exports have contributed 80 percent of GDP growth since 2000, helping Germany grow at a faster rate than its neighbor France in recent years. This growth has led to increased employment and potential domestic consumption growth as an economic buffer against global slowdowns in 2008.\n\nOutsourcing to lower-cost manufacturing locations has recently decreased, with some companies bringing production back to Germany. The Fraunhofer Institute identified 3,500 companies in the machine and chemical industries that have returned offshored production since 2000. Bernd Hoffmann, chairman of Schmitz Cargobull, explained that rather than outsourcing, some companies now choose to in-source production to maintain quality and reduce logistical challenges.\n\nIn France, President Nicolas Sarkozy is considering policy shifts to regain the economic competitiveness that has been declining in recent years. An economist at the French Ministry of Research, Frédérique Sachwald, stated that French companies have been slower in cost control and innovation compared to their German counterparts. A report by Bruegel, a Brussels think tank, suggested that the current French strategy of protecting national champions might not be effective in fostering growth.\n\nDespite this success, Germany faces its own challenges, particularly in the labor market, where manufacturing jobs have declined as a share of the workforce, from 40 percent in 1990 to just 20 percent in recent years. This shift is due to the elimination of less competitive companies and products, which has resulted in a need for higher-skilled labor. Government policies, such as the consideration of restricting temporary employment in response to migration debates, may further limit the flexibility of German companies.\n\nThe primary risk factor in maintaining Germany's growth is continued financial turmoil or a recession in the United States, its second-largest export market. However, with the continued growth in emerging markets, Germany's reindustrialized economy may maintain its position as one of the leading beneficiaries of globalization for an extended period."

        "title": "Tea-tasting: a sceptic's view Is it really worth buying fancy varieties?",
        "original_text": "The tea tasting room at the Taylors of Harrogate HQ is like something out of a gorgeous, tea-centric dream: shelves of caddies, parcels of samples bearing exotic postal stamps, and long, gleaming benches on which many cups are lined up, waiting for me. For a tea lover (eight mugs a day, easy) I am curiously tea-ignorant. I could probably sniff out an Earl Grey, if necessary, but that's about it. I have always viewed indulging in different tea types as a lot of unnecessary faffing about. Tea tasting is a serious business. There is an awful lot of sucking and spitting, and you have to wear a pinny. Ian Brabbin, the head of tea at Taylors, starts me off with some assam, an Indian tea that is a key ingredient in most common or garden blends. It tastes very familiar: a strong black tea (we taste the black teas both with and without milk), though I impress myself by being able to tell that the brew made from the \"second top flush\" - the optimum pick - has a richer flavour. We move on to a couple of Kenyan examples that, again, taste like, well, tea. But, surprisingly, I can already tell the difference between these and the assam. It's lighter and brighter with a pleasant viscosity in the mouth. (Yes, all right, I stole those words from Brabbin. But it's true.) Out of the black teas, it's the darjeeling - often referred to as \"the champagne of teas\" - that really raises the roof. This cup of naturally perfumed, floral loveliness, which is yet, brilliantly, still tea, is a revelation. As are the green teas. And I loathe green tea! In its mass-market bagged form it's a sludgy, bitter, nasty waste of time, and the first one I try does nothing to change my mind. But the pi lo chun - which means \"spring green snail\" in Chinese, alluding to the shape of the dried leaves - could make me think twice. The white tea we try is so fine and light, so clean and refreshing that it's a different drink altogether. I couldn't knock back mug after mug of this to get me through the day; it's something to be savoured and respected. What I really love, however, is the pu-erh, an aged green tea which comes compressed in Frisbee-shape disks and produces a drink that looks like Marmite and tastes venerable, like leather and old wood. I would have to be feeling profligate to drink it on a regular basis, though. The disks are put down for 10 years or more before they are used, with people buying them for investments and paying fortunes for good vintages: one recently sold for £32,000. Indeed, the burgeoning economies of China and India mean increased demand from those countries and more competition for the finest tea. I leave the tea room clutching a few precious leaves of Anji White tea, which costs almost £20 for 125g, and a reassuring knowledge that even in the realm of normal tea bags I can now tell the difference between cheap and nasty (woody, sour) and good and strong (fresher and infinitely more palatable, like the Yorkshire Tea, made by Taylors, which I drink at home). I head to Betty's - Harrogate's famous tearoom - and, feeling terribly knowledgeable all of a sudden, strike out into the wilder reaches of the menu. A pot of darjeeling for me, please.",
        "debiased_text": "The tea tasting room at Taylors of Harrogate HQ features shelves of caddies, parcels of samples with various postal stamps, and long, gleaming benches with multiple cups arranged for tasting. The individual consumes tea regularly, though they admit to limited knowledge about different types.

Ian Brabbin, head of tea at Taylors, began the tasting with an Assam tea, an Indian variety commonly used in standard blends. The tea was described as a strong black tea, with the individual noting that the brew made from the 'second top flush' had a richer taste.

        "original_text": "Police investigating the murder of two Chinese graduates in Newcastle upon Tyne have begun looking into a new line of inquiry after it emerged that one of the students may have become embroiled in an internet betting scam. Xi Zhou and her boyfriend, Zhen Xing Yang, both 25, were found dead in their flat in Newcastle on Saturday with severe head wounds from a knife and another sharp weapon. In searching for a motive for the killings police have so far ruled out the possibility that either were involved in organised crime, and described them as \"a hard-working, respectable couple\". However, this afternoon it transpired that Yang, who detectives have not been able to trace to any job since he completed his MA from Newcastle University in September 2006, had placed advertisements on UK-based Mandarin language website to recruit people to watch football matches around the world. In one he wrote: \"It is a very simple job, any student who is interested, please contact Zhenxing Yang\" before listing an email address. A similar posting under the name CICI-UK, his girlfriend's nickname, which appeared on the powerappple website last October, said: \"Work: watch football games and send live information to people. \"Requirement: Basic understanding of football rules, no professional background needed, advantage if you have a car. \"Location: Sheffield, London, Blackpool, Portsmouth, York, Hull and many other places.\" In December, Yang advertised for people in South America to do the same. On January 5 2007 he posted on a Mandarin-language site: \"Anyone want a 50/hr job? \"UK-based football 'information' company looking for live information from the Mexican League.\" After the murders, internet posters on the site made a series of allegations about the couple. One theory posted online suggested that because football matches shown on TV in China were a minute behind the live action in the stadium, gambling syndicates were placing employees at games to gain an advantage. A Northumbria police spokesman said: \"We continue to look into the lifestyle of both victims and internet websites form part of this investigation. \"We cannot comment further at this stage.\" Internet rumours suggested Yang was an agent, and that some of the employees were in dispute about missing payments. A Mandarin-speaker said today: \"Things did not go smoothly, according to the forum, and people were not paid on time. \"Complaints were raised and some people felt they were cheated.\" Earlier today they said it was likely that whoever was responsible for the murders had also drowned the couple's pet cat after a postmortem examination revealed the couple's pet had been drowned in the bowl of water under the sink in the bathroom. The officer leading the inquiry, Detective Superintendent Steve Wade, said: \"Given the recent nature of the cat's death and where it was found, it is reasonable to assume that those responsible for the two murders also killed the cat.\" Police have looked into whether killing a pet had any cultural significance in Chinese culture and whether cats were thought to be lucky. Wade said police were investigating a possible link between the murders and an individual arrested yesterday morning in the Shieldfield area of the city on suspicion of aggravated burglary.",

        "title": "Heather McRobie: Recognising 'gendercide'",
        "original_text": "Changing our terminology won't stop mass killings, I know that. But it might go some way toward more fully comprehending – and better campaigning against – some of the worst atrocities of our time. Just as \"genocide\" refers to a systematic killing of a race or ethnicity, so \"gendercide\" refers to the systematic killing of a gender. Although Amnesty International and other groups have been right to push for the term \"femicide\" to describe the murder of hundreds of women in Ciudad Juárez in Mexico and Guatemala City, on the whole it'd be more helpful to use the more neutral term \"gendercide\" to help raise awareness of the issue, as, evidently, the victims are not always women. One such case is Srebrenica, the subject of renewed analysis – although it shouldn't take a news story to remind us of it – after the capture of Karadzic last week. It is widely acknowledged that the killing of 8,000 Bosnian men and boys was part of a policy to kill as many non-combatant males as possible, in order to reduce the pool of possible enemy soldiers. Recognising that this was a gendercide is completely compatible with recognising that it was a genocide, a fact which has been long established. The victims of Srebrenica and similar massacres ordered by Karadzic were targeted because of their ethnicity. But they were also targeted because of their gender. To refer to Srebrenica as a gendercide doesn't imply that one gender's suffering in a war was somehow more important than the other side. Linda Grant's recent piece on rape as a weapon of war in Bosnia is a reminder of how women were brutally targeted throughout the conflict. But when a rape occurs during peace-time, we tend to think of it as a violent, misogynistic act. When a rape occurs during war time, we tend to think of it as a violent, racist act – an atrocity motivated by the ethnicity of the victim. We need to start recognising that war is gendered in reality, that in this arena women are not raped solely for being women or solely for their ethnicity, but for the combination of the two. For me, feminism has always been about how rigid gender roles harm everyone, albeit primarily women. And during a war, rigid gender roles, like rigid ethnic stereotypes, lead to a differentiated targeting of civilians. One counter-argument I anticipate in reply to this is that, as \"gendercide\" is a less potent phrase than \"genocide\" (in part by virtue of it still being largely unknown), using it may seem to belittle the genocide committed in Bosnia. But no one is arguing that gender is the main reason for the mass murders in most cases – although it does seem to be the primary element in the gendercides of Ciudad Juárez and Guatemala City. It was, however, an element of the mass killings in Bosnia, and we ignore it at our peril. As a whole, we have little framework for the concept of intersecting discriminations, and until we can formulate a succinct way of expressing the multi-dimensional nature of oppression, to refer to Srebrenica as a genocide and a gendercide may be the best way we can convey the various aspects that were at work. Rather than belittling mass killings, moreover, using the phrase \"gendercide\" in other contexts has the opposite effect: it becomes an important way to convey the true scale and nature of gender-based murders, which are otherwise often dismissed as a conglomerate of discrete phenomena, the product of a few bad eggs. Until we routinely conceptualise the murders of women in Guatemala City and Ciudad Juárez as gendercides – as killings directed specifically against one section of a population – the tragedies will continue to be dismissed as essentially random acts. It's hard to account for the shocking police impunity to the murders in Juárez, but it seems that the Mexican police's position is, essentially, that a few men happen to kill some women, and that's all very sad, but not something society as a whole should feel responsible for, or be concerned about. The evocation of the word \"genocide\" in the word \"gendercide\" – the implication, that, like genocide, it is a crime against humanity for which there are no excuses – would also counter the dead-end cultural relativism that feminists have to deal with from across the spectrum whenever they speak out against gender-based violence. One of the things that is so frustrating about cultural relativism is not its central philosophical tenet so much as the fact it is used so inconsistently by its proponents – no one (I hope) ever says of apartheid South Africa: \"Well, that was just their culture, who are we to judge?\" The systematic oppression of a whole race is not a legitimate part of anyone's culture. But the systematic oppression of a gender? Whenever I raise the topic of countries whose treatment of women could largely be termed a \"gender apartheid\", the response in liberal circles is: \"well, that's their culture, let's not be imperialist\". As though apartheid was a temporal, historical act, within the reach of our moral judgment, whereas \"culture\" must be treated as an innate, ahistorical phenomena which renders it impossible to judge. Why do gender roles get pushed into the play-pen of \"culture\", beyond time and beyond criticism, when ethnicity, it is accepted, is a constructed identity that changes over time, defined and redefined, and manipulated by ultra-nationalists like Karadzic? Is the murder of female children in India and China more forgivable, on the grounds of \"culture\", than the mass murder of ethnic groups? Surely unless you're prepared to stand up and admit: yes, I think it is worse to discriminate on the grounds of race than on gender, then \"gendercide\" is as legitimate a phrase as \"genocide\", and we should be as ready to speak out against it as we are against racial- or ethnicity-based violence. As Karadzic is finally brought to justice, I hope we take into account all the dimensions of the mass killings he and Mladic ordered, so that we can finally begin to make sense of what happened in Bosnia, and prevent it from happening again.",
        "debiased_text": "Changing terminology may not prevent mass killings, but it could help in better understanding and addressing some of the most severe atrocities of recent times. Just as the term 'genocide' is used to describe the systematic killing of a race or ethnicity, the term 'gendercide' refers to the systematic killing of a specific gender. While organizations such as Amnesty International have advocated for the use of 'femicide' to describe the murders of hundreds of women in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, and Guatemala City, the broader term 'gendercide' may be more effective in raising awareness, as victims are not always women. For example, the situation in Srebrenica has seen renewed analysis following the capture of Karadzic last week. It is widely accepted that the killing of 8,000 Bosnian men and boys was part of a policy aimed at reducing the number of potential enemy soldiers by eliminating non-combatant males. Recognizing this event as a gendercide does not diminish its classification as a genocide, which has been established for some time. The victims were targeted because of their ethnicity, but also because of their gender. Referring to Srebrenica as a gendercide does not suggest that the suffering of one gender is more significant than the suffering of another. A recent piece by Linda Grant discusses the use of rape as a weapon of war in Bosnia, highlighting how women were brutally targeted throughout the conflict. However, during peacetime, such acts are often viewed as violent and misogynistic, while during wartime, they are characterized as violent and racist, perceived as acts motivated by the ethnicity of the victim. It is important to recognize that war involves gendered dynamics, and that women are often targeted for both their gender and ethnicity. Feminism, for the author, is concerned with how rigid gender roles harm everyone, although primarily women. During wartime, rigid gender roles, similar to rigid ethnic stereotypes, lead to targeted violence against civilians. A counter-argument to using 'gendercide' is that it may appear less serious than 'genocide' due to its lesser-known status. However, there is no claim that gender is the primary factor in most mass murders, although it was a significant element in cases like Srebrenica, Ciudad Juárez, and Guatemala City. The phrase 'gendercide' can help convey the multi-dimensional nature of oppression. It does not belittle the genocide in Bosnia, but rather highlights the role of gender in those atrocities. The use of 'gendercide' in other contexts can help emphasize the seriousness of gender-based murders, which are sometimes dismissed as isolated incidents. Until such murders in locations like Guatemala City and Ciudad Juárez are recognized as gendercides, they may continue to be treated as random events. The lack of accountability by the police for these murders in Juárez is difficult to explain, but it seems that the Mexican authorities regard these killings as isolated incidents caused by a few individuals rather than widespread societal issues. The term 'gendercide' implies that, like genocide, these acts are crimes against humanity that cannot be justified. This counters cultural relativism, which is inconsistently used to justify certain practices. For example, it is unlikely that anyone would defend apartheid South Africa by citing 'culture'. Systematic racial oppression is not seen as a legitimate component of culture. However, the systematic oppression of a gender is often dismissed as a cultural norm, allowing for criticism of practices like gender apartheid but not of cultural traditions. The author questions whether the murder of female children in countries such as India and China is more forgivable under the banner of 'culture' compared to the mass murder of ethnic groups. Unless one acknowledges that racial discrimination is worse than gender discrimination, the term 'gendercide' should be considered as legitimate as 'genocide'. As Karadzic is brought to justice, the author hopes that the full dimensions of the mass killings he and Mladic ordered in Bosnia will be considered in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of these events and prevent their recurrence."

        "original_text": "\"Feeling tense and angry because you cannot get online?\" asks the state-run China Daily. Powerless to stop scouring eBay for second-hand bargains you don't really need? Unable to tear yourself away from stalking would-be love interests on Facebook? It could be a sign of \"internet addiction\", according to psychologists in China, which could become the first nation to classify the problem as a clinical disorder. So what constitutes an official diagnosis? \"I fall asleep with a laptop on my bed on top of 2 books is that bad?\" asks one Lifehacker reader. A manual expected to be approved by the Chinese Ministry of Health says staying online for more than six hours a day, instead of working or studying, and having adverse reactions from not being able to get online, are two major symptoms of Internet Addiction Disorder (IAD). A tendency to overindulge in activities such as online gaming, watching pornography, using social networking sites and internet shopping afflicts sufferers. The Chinese manual would be the first of its kind in the world, adding to the controversy over whether compulsive internet use should be officially viewed as a mental disorder. Earlier this year an editorial by a leading practitioner in the American Journal of Psychiatry argued in favour of such a move. US academics have found that more than one in eight Americans showed at least one possible sign of problematic internet use, with some web surfers already starting to seek medical help. In China, which has faced strong criticism for its attempts to control what citizens can see online, said citizens could go to one of several scary-sounding boot camp-style rehabilitation clinics. Treatment includes not just counselling but military discipline, drugs, hypnosis and mild electric shocks. Tempted?",
        "debiased_text": "A state-run publication in China, China Daily, posed a question to readers about their feelings of tension and anger related to difficulty accessing the internet. It suggested that an inability to resist activities such as searching for second-hand items on eBay, using social media platforms like Facebook, or engaging in online gaming and shopping might indicate a condition referred to as 'internet addiction.' Psychologists in China have proposed classifying this as a clinical disorder, potentially making the country the first in the world to do so. According to a manual expected to be approved by the Chinese Ministry of Health, Internet Addiction Disorder (IAD) may be diagnosed based on criteria including spending more than six hours per day online instead of working or studying, and experiencing adverse reactions when unable to access the internet.

Now we, and they, must manage its triumph.",
        "original_text": "For Americans, 2008 is an important election year. But for much of the world, it is likely to be seen as the year that China moved to center stage, with the Olympics serving as the country's long-awaited coming-out party. The much-heralded advent of China as a global power is no longer a forecast but a reality. On issue after issue, China has become the second most important country on the planet. Consider what's happened already this past year. In 2007 China contributed more to global growth than the United States, the first time another country had done so since at least the 1930s. It also became the world's largest consumer, eclipsing the United States in four of the five basic food, energy and industrial commodities. And a few months ago China surpassed the United States to become the world's leading emitter of CO2. Whether it's trade, global warming, Darfur or North Korea, China has become the new x factor, without which no durable solution is possible. And yet the Chinese do not quite see themselves this way. Susan Shirk, the author of a recent book about the country, \"The Fragile Superpower,\" tells a revealing tale. Whenever she mentions her title in America, people say to her, \"Fragile? China doesn't seem fragile.\" But in China people say, \"Superpower? China isn't a superpower.\" In fact it's both, and China's fragility is directly related to its extraordinary rise. Lawrence Summers has recently pointed out that during the Industrial Revolution the average European's living standards rose about 50 percent over the course of his lifetime (then about 40 years). In Asia, principally China, he calculates, the average person's living standards are set to rise by 10,000 percent in one lifetime! The scale and pace of growth in China has been staggering, utterly unprecedented in history-and it has produced equally staggering change. In two decades China has experienced the same degree of industrialization, urbanization and social transformation as Europe did in two centuries. Recall what China looked like only 30 years ago. It was a devastated country, one of the world's poorest, with a totalitarian state. It was just emerging from Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution, which had destroyed universities, schools and factories, all to revitalize the revolution. Since then 400 million people have been lifted out of poverty in China-about 75 percent of the world's total poverty reduction over the last century. The country has built new cities and towns, roads and ports, and is planning for the future in impressive detail. So far Beijing has managed to balance economic growth and social stability in a highly fluid environment. Given their challenges, China's political leaders stand out for their governing skills. The regime remains a dictatorship, with a monopoly on power. But it has expanded personal liberty in ways that would be recognizable to John Locke or Thomas Jefferson. People in China can now work, travel, own property and increasingly worship as they please. This is not enough, but it is not insignificant, either. But whether this forward movement-economic and political-will continue has become the crucial question for China. It is a question that is being asked not just in the West but in China, and for practical reasons. The regime's main problem is not that it's incurably evil but that it is losing control over its own country. Growth has empowered localities and regions to the point that decentralization is now the defining reality of Chinese life. Central tax collection is lower than in most countries, a key indicator of Beijing's weakness. On almost every issue-slowing down lending, curbing greenhouse-gas emissions-the central government issues edicts that are ignored by the provinces. As China moves up the value chain, so the gap between rich and poor grows dramatically. Large sectors of the economy and society are simply outside the grip of the Communist Party, which has become an elite technocracy, sitting above the 1.3 billion people it leads. Political reform is part of the solution to this problem. China needs a more open, accountable and responsive form of government, one that can exercise control in what has become a more chaotic and empowered society. What such reform would look like remains an open question, but one that is being debated within the seniormost levels of the regime. In the current issue of Foreign Affairs, John Thornton, an investment banker turned China expert, traces how Beijing is taking hesitant but clear steps toward greater rule of law and accountability. China's sense of its own weakness casts a shadow over its foreign policy. It is unique as a world power, the first in modern history to be at once rich (in aggregate terms) and poor (in per capita terms). It still sees itself as a developing country, with hundreds of millions of peasants to worry about. It views many of the issues on which it is pressed-global warming, human rights-as rich-country problems. (When it comes to pushing regimes to open up, Beijing also worries about the implications for its own undemocratic structure.) But this is changing. From North Korea to Darfur to Iran, China has been slowly showing that it wants to be a responsible \"stakeholder\" in the international system. Some scholars and policy intellectuals (and a few generals in the Pentagon) look at the rise of China and see the seeds of inevitable great-power conflict and perhaps even war. Look at history, they say. When a new power rises it inevitably disturbs the balance of power, unsettles the international order and seeks a place in the sun. This makes it bump up against the established great power of the day (that would be us). So, Sino-U.S. conflict is inevitable. But some great powers have been like Nazi Germany and others like modern-day Germany and Japan. The United States moved up the global totem pole and replaced Britain as the No. 1 country without a war between the two nations. Conflict and competition-particularly in the economic realm-between China and the United States is inevitable. But whether this turns ugly depends largely on policy choices that will be made in Washington and Beijing over the next decade. In another Foreign Affairs essay, Princeton's John Ikenberry makes the crucially important point that the current world order is extremely conducive to China's peaceful rise. That order, he argues, is integrated, rule-based, with wide and deep foundations-and there are massive economic benefits for China to work within this system. Meanwhile, nuclear weapons make it suicidal to risk a great-power war. \"Today's Western order, in short, is hard to overturn and easy to join,\" writes Ikenberry. The Chinese show many signs of understanding these conditions. Their chief strategist, Zheng Bijian, coined the term \"peaceful rise\" to describe just such an effort on Beijing's part to enter into the existing order rather than overturn it. The Chinese government has tried to educate its public on these issues, releasing a 12-part documentary last year, \"The Rise of Great Nations,\" whose central lesson is that markets and not empire determine the long-run success of a great global power. But while the conditions exist for peace and cooperation, there are also many factors pointing in the other direction. As China grows in strength, it grows in pride and nationalist feeling-which will be on full display at the Summer Olympic Games. Beijing's mandarin class is convinced that the United States wishes it ill. Washington, meanwhile-sitting atop a unipolar order-is unused to the idea of sharing power or accommodating another great power's interests. Flashpoints like human rights, Taiwan or some unforeseen incident could spiral badly in an atmosphere of mistrust and with domestic constituencies-on both sides-eager to sound tough. Two thousand eight is the year of China. It should also be the year we craft a serious long-term China policy.",
        "debiased_text": "2008 was an important election year for Americans. For much of the world, it was a year in which China took a more prominent role, highlighted by the hosting of the Olympics. In 2007, China contributed more to global economic growth than the United States, marking the first time since at least the 1930s that another country had done so. Additionally, in 2007, China became the largest consumer of four out of five basic food, energy, and industrial commodities. In the previous months, it also surpassed the United States in CO2 emissions. China has become a significant factor in various global issues such as trade, climate change, Darfur, and North Korea. However, Chinese leaders do not universally perceive China as a superpower. According to Susan Shirk, author of 'The Fragile Superpower,' discussions about China’s status as a superpower show different perspectives: in the U.S., people question the notion of fragility, while in China, some question the idea of being a superpower. China has experienced extraordinary economic growth, with living standards rising significantly over the past few decades. This growth has brought about substantial social and economic changes, including industrialization, urbanization, and social transformation. In the last 30 years, China transitioned from being one of the poorest countries in the world with a totalitarian regime to lifting 400 million people out of poverty, which is about 75 percent of the world's total poverty reduction over the last century. The government has constructed new cities, infrastructure, and is implementing long-term plans. While maintaining economic growth and social stability, China's leaders face challenges in governing a rapidly evolving society. Decentralization has led to increasing autonomy in local regions, which has reduced the central government's control and tax collection. Some scholars suggest that China needs a more open, accountable, and responsive government to manage its growing complexity. The government has taken cautious steps toward greater rule of law and accountability, as noted by John Thornton. Despite China’s economic strength, it still considers itself a developing country with a large population of rural residents. It positions itself as a responsible 'stakeholder' in the international system, as observed in its involvement with issues such as North Korea, Darfur, and Iran. Some analysts argue that great power transitions often lead to conflict, but others, such as John Ikenberry, suggest that the current world order is conducive to a peaceful rise for China. It is rule-based and offers significant economic benefits if China chooses to participate in it rather than challenge it. China's leadership has promoted the concept of a 'peaceful rise' and has made efforts to educate the public, including a documentary titled 'The Rise of Great Nations.' While conditions exist for cooperation, factors such as growing nationalist sentiment and differing approaches to power-sharing between China and the United States may contribute to tensions. 2008 is noted as a significant year for China as it moved to center stage, and it is also a time for considering long-term policies toward the country."

        "original_text": "It takes an extraordinary effort of will to imagine the circumstances or mentality that could have led the management of China's Sanlu dairy to deliberately add the toxic industrial chemical melamine to its infant milk powder products. That, though, is infamously what happened last year, when Sanlu executives authorised the mixing of nitrogen-rich melamine to raw milk in an attempt to boost the product's protein content. As a result, at least six babies died and some 300,000 fell ill last autumn. Arrests and trials followed, and last week death penalty verdicts were brought in against a cattle farmer and a milk trader for producing and selling the tainted products. Sanlu's former boss was also given a life prison sentence and nine other officials were given jail terms. The deliberate poisoning of baby milk is by any standards an unusually despicable act. That those responsible should be severely punished is obvious. Nevertheless, the two capital sentences in the milk poisoning scandal once again cast the spotlight on China's unusually extensive use of the death penalty and on the more general failure of the Chinese criminal justice system to adhere to internationally accepted human rights standards. Abominable though these crimes were, they do not justify the death sentences that have been imposed. China should not be in any doubt that the execution of the poisoners diminishes rather than enhances international respect for its criminal justice system. China is the lord high executioner of the world. It is one of five nations – Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United States are the others – which, between them, were responsible for 88% of known executions in 2007, the last year for which figures are available. In all probability the proportion is much higher, mainly because China refuses to publish any official statistics. In 2007, Amnesty International recorded 470 executions in China, a figure that it calls an absolute minimum. The San Francisco and Hong Kong-based Dui Hua Foundation estimates that the true total of Chinese executions in 2007 was 5,000. If true, that means China executes more people every year than the rest of the world combined. Bear in mind that 2007 was a record low year, in which China began to restrict the use of the death penalty, at least by its own standards, in part because of the then-impending Beijing Olympics. Tighter guidelines on death penalty appeals were issued last month. All this is progress, but nothing like enough. If one of the great tests of the Obama administration will be the extent to which it can wean US legislators off the death penalty, the same applies on the epic scale for China's rulers.",

The incident raised questions about China's use of the death penalty and its adherence to international human rights standards. In 2007, Amnesty International reported that China carried out at least 470 executions, a figure described as an absolute minimum. The Dui Hua Foundation, based in San Francisco and Hong Kong, estimated that the actual number of executions in China that year could have been as high as 5,000. If accurate, this would mean China executed more individuals than all other countries combined. In 2007, China began to restrict the use of the death penalty, partly in preparation for the Beijing Olympics. More recent guidelines have been issued to tighten the process for death penalty appeals. These measures represent some progress, but further reform is considered necessary."

Flora Wu suggested that this move could address unmet demand caused by China Mobile's previous high tariffs and outdated devices through increased cooperation with operators."

The gesture accompanied the presentation of the biannual white paper on China's National Defence, the release of which some analysts said had been timed for the inauguration. \"A few hours from now, Mr Obama will be inaugurated. In the new era, we hope that both sides can make joint efforts to create favourable conditions for the continued improvement and development of military relations,\" said Hu Changming, spokesman of the ministry of national defence. The softer tone contrasts with the uncompromising line Beijing has taken towards the outgoing administration of George W. Bush over military matters. For two months, the defence ministry has demanded that Washington reverse its October decision to sell $6.5bn in arms to Taiwan. China's past three defence white papers had December release dates. \"This one was delayed to wait for the Obama inauguration,\" said Andrew Yang, secretary of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies in Taiwan. He added that recent improvements in cross-Strait relations and the military's need to reflect those in the document also contributed to the delay. Currently, three Chinese ships are in the Gulf of Aden to protect Chinese commercial vessels from pirates. Beijing's message that it wants to get ties with the US back on track is part of an effort to ensure the People's Liberation Army engages more closely with international counterparts. The white paper echoes this stance. \"China's security situation has improved steadily,\" it said, while mentioning the economic and technological advantage of developed nations' and western efforts at containing it as challenges. Beyond such general statements, however, the information in the document is sparse. It gives figures for defence spending to 2007 by branch of service and type of expenditure, but in explaining the considerations behind it, only says: \"Defence expenditure has always been kept at a reasonable and appropriate level.\"",

        "original_text": "global overview ; Gold at highest level for six months ; Signs of V-shaped recovery detected Investor risk appetite was sub-dued yesterday in spite of a strong rally for Chinese stocks and further signs the global economy was pulling out of recession. Indeed, gold climbed to a six-month high amid growing concerns about the strength of US consumer demand ahead of the release today of August's crucial employment report. However, Tim Bond, head of global asset allocation at Barclays Capital, argued that recent data releases had continued to build a strong case in favour of a \"V-shaped\" economic recovery. \"Leading indicators are now strongly suggesting that a US labour market recovery is just around the corner, with commensurately bullish implications for spending,\" he said. \"Employment growth is also good news for banks, serving to further curtail loan losses on consumer debt, residential mortgages and commercial real estate loans.\" But Kim Whelan, economic analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, said that while recovery was plausible, concerns about the consumer remained. \"Consumers remain reluctant to spend as they were accustomed to before the bust, largely due to vast losses of wealth across asset classes as well as the weak and volatile state of the labour market.\" Service sector data from across the globe yesterday painted an encouraging picture. The US Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing index rose to 48.4 this month, just a whisker away from the 50 mark that signals expansion and the slowest pace of contraction for 11 months. Just two days ago, an ISM report showed that manufacturing expanded in August for the first time in 19 months. Meanwhile, initial US jobless claims fell last week, although the total was higher than expected. Further good news came from the eurozone as retail sales figures for July and final readings for last month's purchasing managers' indices offered support to the view that the region's economy may now be expanding again. In the UK, a forecast-beating report on service sector activity helped offset some of the disappointment from its manufacturing equivalent earlier this week. However, the day's economic releases had only a limited impact on US and European equities , in spite of a strong lead from China. The Shanghai Composite index jumped 4.8 per cent, its biggest one-day gain for six months, after a leading regulator reassured investors that the market was healthy. However, the mood elsewhere in Asia was far less sanguine. Hong Kong lagged behind with a gain of 1.2 per cent, while the Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo slipped 0.6 per cent and most other leading markets put in cautious performances. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended 0.1 per cent lower, its fourth successive decline, while in New York the S&P 500 closed up 0.9 per cent. On the currency markets , signs of improved risk appetite initially weighed on the dollar, allowing the euro to rise to $1.4348 before it retreated back to $1.4250, barely changed on the day. The European Central Bank, as expected, left its key interest rate at 1 per cent, and also sounded a cautious note about the economic outlook, in spite of upward revisions to its economic growth forecasts. \"The main message from the ECB press conference is that an exit from the central bank's super accommodative stance remains some way off,\" said Nick Kounis, chief European economist at Fortis Bank. German government bonds fell for the first time in three days after the ECB raised its growth forecasts. The 10-year yield rose 2 basis points to 3.24 per cent, while the 10-year UK gilt yield climbed 4bp to 3.59 per cent after the encouraging UK service sector data. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury was up 4bp at 3.34 per cent. In commodities , gold continued its march towards the $1,000 an ounce level, reaching $997.80 - the highest level since mid-February - after breaking out of a recent $930-$960 range on Wednesday. Oil was slightly lower and base metals staged a broad-based rally, although US natural gas futures fell to a fresh 7 1/2 -year low.",

GM is \"impressed with Beijing Auto's preparedness and professionalism and their ability to work through the issues quickly,\" the person said. GM is \"becoming more enthusiastic about potentially striking a deal with Beijing Auto,\" the person said. The offer from Beijing Auto, which is being advised by a former senior GM executive, is valued at 660 million euros ($922.5 million). An advantage of the offer, according to the knowledgeable person, is that Beijing Auto doesn't plan to close any Opel factories in Germany, and it would ask only 2.64 billion euros in German government guarantees, much less than the 4.5 billion euros Magna is asking for. GM signed a nonexclusive memorandum of understanding in May to sell a majority stake in Opel and British sister brand Vauxhall to Magna, whose bid is backed by Russia's Sberbank Rossia and auto maker OAO GAZ Group. In recent weeks, GM stepped up talks with Beijing Auto and with RHJ International SA, a Brussels-based holding company linked to U.S. buyout group Ripplewood Holdings LLC, because GM's negotiations with Magna encountered some potential issues. One potential hitch is over what kind of access to GM's technology Sberbank and OAO GAZ might gain through Opel. Beijing Auto's offer also has potential problems, including the potential competitive threat that a Beijing Auto-owned Opel might pose to GM's business in China.

Officials at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said they would be going ahead with plans to make the software - known as Green Dam - compulsory. Despite claims that it had decided to shelve Green Dam - which is intended to prevent access to pornographic material - the government \"will not back away\" on its plans for the software, an official told China Daily. The move follows a string of controversies over the plan, and after internet giant Google agreed to filter its search results in China to screen out pornographic or explicit material. Over the weekend the Californian company responded to a series of requests by the China Internet Illegal Information Reporting Centre (CIIRC) to block or filter explicit images, video and vulgar content by agreeing to implement changes. \"We are undertaking a thorough review of our service and taking all necessary steps to fix any problems with our results,\" said Google in a statement. \"We believe we have addressed a large majority of the problem results.\" Last week the authorities in Beijing had issued a statement that \"strongly condemned\" the Californian internet giant for allowing its website, Google.cn to link to pornographic material. \"Google China's website has not installed filters to block pornography in accordance with the laws and regulations of our nation,\" said the CIIRC. \"A lot of overseas internet pornographic information has spread into our nation by way of this website, seriously violating laws and regulations.\" The decision by Google will be regarded as another victory for Beijing, three years after the US company launched a version of its search engine that was self-censored in accordance with Chinese law - a decision that campaigners said heralded a \"black day\" for freedom of expression. Despite that decision, however, Google has yet to secure dominance in the Chinese internet market - with just 27.8% of all searches in China are conducted on its website. That is still a substantial amount of traffic, given the country's number of internet users, but trails local rival Baidu, which has 62.2% of the market. Green Dam is due to be included in all new machines sold after July 1, and experts have published a series of details which show that the software - made by military-backed software company Jinhui - will not only filter out pornography, but also controversial political information about Falun Gong and the Tiananmen Square massacre. In addition, an American software company called Solid Oak has claimed that some of the code used to make Green Dam is stolen from its own cybernanny products. \"The US government is concerned about Green Dam, both in terms of its potential impact on trade and the serious technical issues raised by use of the software,\" said a spokesman for the US Embassy in Beijing.",

        "original_text": "BEIJING -- More than a thousand steel workers in China's northeast staged an at-times violent protest against the planned takeover of their state-run employer and a group of them killed a top executive at the private company that was to acquire it, Chinese state-run media reported. Workers from Tonghua Iron & Steel Group in Jilin province, upset over job losses expected from the takeover, beat to death Chen Guojun, a manager from Beijing-based Jianlong Group who had been sent to Tonghua to oversee the merger, the Xinhua news agency reported early Monday. Some of the protesters blocked roads and threw bricks at police who tried to intervene to save Mr. Chen, Xinhua said, citing the provincial government. The protesters numbered \"more than 1,000,\" Xinhua said. A separate report Monday in China Daily, a state-run English-language newspaper, said there were some 3,000 protesters in all. Some of them attacked Mr. Chen after he informed workers that Tonghua Iron & Steel's work force would be cut to 5,000 from about 30,000, the report said, citing a local police officer. Workers were particularly distraught because they had expected to benefit from rising steel prices, it said. Officials at Tonghua Iron & Steel couldn't be reached for comment. A person who answered the phone at Jianlong's Beijing headquarters Sunday said he knew nothing about the protests and that other company representatives were unavailable. After the violence, which took place Friday evening, Tonghua Iron & Steel issued a notice on local television informing its employees and their families that the provincial government had decided to ask Jianlong to shelve its acquisition plans and withdraw from further involvement in Tonghua's restructuring. The incident could put a crimp in Beijing's efforts to consolidate the Chinese steel industry, the world's largest by output. The central government wants to eliminate surplus production capacity and create larger, globally competitive players in the industry, which like many industrial sectors in China is dominated by local governments that have long resisted consolidation. The protest illustrates the challenge China's Communist Party rulers face from unrest by citizens. Sizable protests happen frequently in China, where people have few effective legal means for addressing grievances. On Saturday, two local officials were removed from their posts in the Hubei province city of Shishou for \"mishandling\" a protest of hundreds of people last month, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The takeover of Tonghua Iron & Steel has been years in the making. In 2005, Jianlong took a 36% stake as part of a restructuring of the provincial-government-owned company, according to the local government. A downturn in the steel industry that started last year triggered losses at Tonghua, and Jianlong sought to withdraw its investment. Steel prices rebounded earlier this year, and Tonghua posted a 43 million yuan ($6.3 million) profit in June. Jianlong then reversed course and bid to become the majority shareholder. The Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy, a Hong Kong-based group, in a report over the weekend said as many as 30,000 people took part in the protest, and that 100 people were injured. None of the figures in the group's report or in state media reports could be independently verified. The information center said protesters complained that they hadn't been consulted about the takeover plan. The information center, founded in 1993 by a mainland Chinese dissident, collects reports of human-rights violations and protests from informants across China. A representative of the community management office in a Tonghua neighborhood where many steelworkers live said Friday's protests had been \"a really big thing, and most of the residents know about it.\" A government official in the district where Tonghua Iron & Steel is situated referred questions on Sunday to other departments, where calls went unanswered.

        "original_text": "An Australian mining executive detained in China was publicly accused Friday of bribing steelmakers to obtain state secrets during negotiations over the price of iron ore, and an official on the other side of the talks is also being held. The developments suggest the case is focused around annual negotiations in which China has tried to hold down costs of iron ore for the nation's steel mills. China says the alleged espionage hurt the nation's economic interest and economic security. The allegations of bribery were made in a statement, published in Chinese media Friday, by the State Security Bureau in Shanghai, an intelligence arm of the Chinese government. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd played down the situation, in which four employees of Anglo-Australian mining company Rio Tinto PLC were detained Sunday, including three Chinese workers and Stern Hu, an Australian who heads Rio Tinto's iron-ore division in China. Mr. Rudd, who served as a diplomat in China, said there have been ups and downs in Australia's relations with China and that they can be managed. In an interview with 3AW radio, Mr. Rudd called it a \"complex, consular\" case and said Australia's objective is to secure Mr. Hu's release. Iron-ore supply is at the heart of a growing economic relationship in which Australia and China have become increasingly interdependent, making the situation particularly sensitive. Two Chinese steel-industry executives said Tan Yixin, an official with a Beijing-based steelmaker under state-owned Shougang Corp., has been detained in connection with the case. A spokesman for Shougang declined to comment. Mr. Tan couldn't be reached to comment. No official statement has been made about Mr. Tan's detention. Shougang isn't one of China's top steelmakers, but the state-owned company would have been in a position to give suppliers insight into China's bottom line in the iron-ore price negotiations, which broke down after failing to conclude by a June 30 deadline. Rio Tinto said it is unaware of any evidence that would support the allegations against its employees. \"Rio Tinto is committed to high standards in business integrity,\" a spokeswoman said. In annual talks over a benchmark ore price for the steel industry, China has attempted to build a united front of steelmakers that is designed to win concessions from major ore suppliers, namely Brazil's Vale SA and the Anglo-Australian giants BHP-Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto. Yet, each year, as Chinese demand soars, China's steelmakers have been forced to swallow double-digit price increases, in line with deals set by other nations. The talks over the ore price for 2009 have been made more contentious by Rio Tinto's cancellation last month of plans to sell an 18% stake to a Chinese company, Aluminum Corp. of China, for over $19 billion, and its move instead toward a deal with BHP Billiton. Beijing has claimed a BHP-Rio partnership would dominate the market and result in even higher prices. The China Iron & Steel Association, the umbrella organization of steelmakers charged with leading the price talks, has had difficulty winning credibility as the true representative of the overall industry, and instead is seen as a tool of big producers. Smaller steelmakers, analysts say, have increasingly undermined the government's effort to leverage China's buying power into pricing power. The smaller companies, including Shougang, have scooped up iron ore from Rio Tinto and others on a spot market where they pay high global prices, instead of waiting for a China benchmark to emerge. Australian consular officials were set to visit Mr. Hu Friday. Australia said it will consult with Mr. Hu's family and employer before commenting on the visit. Enlarge this image.",

A Shougang spokesperson declined to provide a comment, and Tan could not be reached for a response. There has been no official statement regarding Tan's detention. While Shougang is not among China's leading steel producers, it could have provided suppliers with insights into China's position during the iron-ore price negotiations, which failed to reach a conclusion by the June 30 deadline. Rio Tinto stated that it is not aware of any evidence supporting the allegations against its employees. A spokeswoman for the company affirmed its commitment to maintaining high standards of business integrity.

The 2009 negotiations have become more complicated due to Rio Tinto's decision to cancel a plan to sell an 18% stake to a Chinese company, Aluminum Corp. of China, for over $19 billion. The company has opted instead for a deal with BHP Billiton. Beijing has expressed concerns that a partnership between BHP and Rio Tinto could lead to a market dominance and further price increases. The China Iron & Steel Association, which oversees the price talks, has faced challenges in gaining credibility as the legitimate representative of the industry, with some perceiving it as more aligned with major producers. Analysts note that smaller steelmakers have increasingly bypassed the government's efforts to use China's purchasing power to influence pricing by acquiring iron ore on the spot market at high global prices, rather than waiting for a China benchmark to be established. Australian consular officials were scheduled to visit Hu on Friday. Australia indicated that it would consult with Hu's family and employer before making any public comments on the visit."

        "title": "Case study: Electric shock therapy in China for internet 'addiction'",
        "original_text": "Teng Fei, 17, was given electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) for internet addiction at a centre in China. When Teng Fei's mother told him that his dad had been taken ill the horrified teenager rushed straight to hospital. But it was a ruse and within hours he underwent the painful treatment. He was given ECT many more times in the following weeks. \"It was really painful – just like a needle piercing through my brain,\" he said. Teng Fei insists he never had a problem in the first place and does not believe that internet addiction exists. \"I admit the internet can be quite alluring and sometimes I would use it all day, but if I had other things to do – like playing basketball – I wouldn't use it at all,\" he said. \"Then my mum saw the adverts on television. They demonised the internet and after watching them she believed I was sick and it was very serious.\" He was given ECT for the first time when he resisted admission to the clinic. \"I can't remember how many times [they gave me shocks], but it must have been dozens. They would let me rest for a while then give me another. The session lasted about half an hour,\" he said. \"I struggled and tried to get up and they said it meant I still did not agree to stay so they gave me more shocks for another half an hour … I agreed to stay because I really couldn't stand any more of it.\" He received ECT six or seven times at the hospital, mostly for a few minutes at a time. \"I think at the beginning they just wanted to create fear so you would follow orders. The shocks were punishment if I did anything wrong,\" he said. When he tried to escape, he was subjected to another half hour of ECT. Doctors also gave him antidepressants and traditional Chinese medicine. Each day the teenagers would have morning lessons which included parents and urged them to believe in and co-operate with the programme, followed by drills in the afternoon. Teng Fei's parents spent about 14,000 yuan (£1,250) for his treatment: a 7,000 yuan monthly fee, a 2,000 yuan fine for running away and a 5,000 penalty payment for ending treatment early. \"The treatment should last four months, but my father started to think it was all a con,\" he said. \"He realised that in the classes no one could express opinions contrary to what they were told. Also, when I told him how painful the shocks were and he saw himself how young people grimaced before they went into that room, his heart ached for me.\" Teng Fei added: \"I don't think it helped at all. I didn't have internet addiction before, so I acted exactly as I did before I went in there. I still use the internet now and my parents don't really interfere.\" • Additional research by Chen Shi",
        "debiased_text": "Teng Fei, a 17-year-old individual, received electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) at a clinic in China for treating internet addiction. His mother informed him that his father had fallen ill, prompting Teng Fei to go to the hospital. However, this was part of a strategy to admit him to the clinic, and shortly after, he underwent ECT. Over the following weeks, he received multiple additional ECT sessions. Teng Fei described the treatment as painful, comparing it to a needle piercing through his brain. He stated he did not believe he had an internet addiction and suggested that his mother was influenced by television advertisements that portrayed the internet as a serious problem. Teng Fei mentioned that he initially resisted admission to the clinic and received ECT for the first time as a result. He could not recall the exact number of sessions but estimated it to be in the dozens. Each session lasted approximately half an hour, with periods of rest in between. He described struggling during the treatment and being given more shocks if he attempted to leave the clinic. After multiple sessions, he agreed to stay due to the intensity of the treatment. Teng Fei received ECT for a period of six to seven times, with each session lasting a few minutes. He also reported being given antidepressants and traditional Chinese medicine during his treatment. The clinic's daily schedule included morning lessons attended by parents, emphasizing cooperation with the program, and afternoon drills. Teng Fei's parents incurred a total cost of approximately 14,000 yuan for his treatment, which included a monthly fee of 7,000 yuan, a 2,父亲 began to question the legitimacy of the treatment after observing that participants were not allowed to express differing opinions during classes. Teng Fei also mentioned that he did not find the treatment effective and continued to use the internet as he did prior to his admission. His parents are not currently interfering with his internet use."

        "title": "Corporate News: Steel Output Gets Ahead of Stimulus Plan --- Some Prices Decline as Production Is Ramped Up, Particularly in China, Outpacing Demand; Corporate News: Steel Output Gets Ahead of Stimulus Plan --- Some Prices Decline as Production Is Ramped Up, Particularly in China, Outpacing Demand",
        "original_text": "Eager to cash in on stimulus packages in China, the U.S. and Europe, some steelmakers are ramping up production. But some are moving too quickly, causing steel prices to drop again after recovering earlier this year. The situation illustrates the dilemma for industries that need to fill the pipeline with construction-critical products but are uncertain about when they will be needed. China, in particular, is beginning to see steel prices slide after the capacity utilization of the country's steel mills increased in recent months to about 90% from 75%. Baosteel Group Corp., China's largest steelmaker by output, last month restarted one of its idled mills in anticipation of stimulus-related construction. Angang Steel Co., the listed arm of Anshan Iron & Steel Group Corp., China's second-largest steelmaker, last week said it would increase production this year by 25%, or four million metric tons. The increases are in response to China's $585 billion stimulus program, which will include work on steel-intensive bridges, railroads, roads and buildings. Since those projects take time to scale up, steel supply at this point is exceeding demand, sending prices lower. The price for Chinese hot-rolled steel in February rebounded to about $490 a metric ton from about $360 in November. This month, the price has dropped to about $415 because demand hasn't grown as quickly as expected. \"Everybody had been looking for any kind of sign of increased demand,\" said Karlis Kirsis, a managing partner at Steel Dynamics, a steel research firm based in New York. \"But they overproduced and now they want to get rid of it.\" The concern is that the slide in prices could spill over to the U.S. and parts of Europe, where prices have remained relatively steady after falling dramatically several months ago. J.P. Morgan steel analyst Frank Li said an additional 90 million metric tons will be needed as a result of China's economic-stimulus program. But demand will be limited to certain types of steel and some steelmakers have failed to take that into account, the China-based analyst said. The greatest need will be for pipe, rebar, tubing steel and flat-rolled steel for roads, underground pipes and bridges, he said. There will be less immediate need for plate, stainless and other high-value specialized steel related to the aerospace and housing markets. Mr. Li said the stimulus program's benefits will be tempered by slowdowns in real estate and for so-called mechanical equipment, which is used in factories. Steel prices in North America, Europe and other places are barely holding level after months of decline. Hot-rolled steel in the U.S. is selling for about $531 a short ton. (A short ton is 0.9 metric ton.) European prices are slightly lower at $479 a metric ton. Some North American steelmakers say demand for some products is no longer falling. \"If we want to look for a bright spot, I think, from a pricing standpoint, we do believe that the worst is behind us,\" said David Hannah, chief executive of Reliance Steel and Aluminum, North America's largest steel service center by sales. Service centers, which process steel for end users, are good barometers for steel demand. Reliance attributed firmer prices to widespread moves in recent months to idle production. Recently, U.S. Steel Corp. said it will temporarily close operations in Canada. ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker, has idled plants in the U.S. Both companies declined to comment on their production plans. U.S. steelmakers have been cautious about firing up production in response to Washington's stimulus package. They said they aren't sure precisely when steel will be needed and don't want to undercut the prices just when they have begun to stabilize. The steelmakers also said they can increase capacity quickly and that current inventories would be sufficient for immediate sales. Russian steelmaker Severstal OAO has idled operations to help get capacity in line with demand. CEO Alexey Mordashov said last month that the steelmaker was seeing positive signs in the beginning of this year relative to the last quarter of 2008. \"Stimulus plans announced by many national governments are likely to support demand for steel in 2009,\" the company said.",

These increases are in response to China's $585 billion economic stimulus program, which involves infrastructure projects such as bridges, railroads, roads, and buildings. However, as these projects take time to scale up, current steel supply is outpacing demand, resulting in a decline in steel prices. The price for Chinese hot-rolled steel rose to about $490 per metric ton in February from approximately $360 in November, but it has since dropped to about $415 due to slower-than-expected demand growth. Karlis Kirsis, a managing partner at Steel Dynamics, a New York-based steel research firm, noted that industry participants had been anticipating increased demand but have instead overproduced, leading to efforts to offload excess supply. Concerns exist that the decline in steel prices within China may impact the U.S. and parts of Europe, where prices have been relatively stable after a significant drop earlier this year. Frank Li, a J.P. Morgan steel analyst based in China, estimated that an additional 90 million metric tons of steel will be needed as a result of the economic-stimulus program. However, he indicated that demand will be concentrated on specific types of steel, such as pipe, rebar, tubing steel, and flat-rolled steel for roads, underground pipes, and bridges, while the demand for plate, stainless, and other high-value specialized steels is expected to be lower. Mr. Li also pointed out that the benefits of the stimulus program may be limited by slowdowns in the real estate and mechanical equipment sectors, which are used in factories.

The price for hot-rolled steel in the U.S. is around $531 per short ton, while in Europe, it is slightly lower at approximately $479 per metric ton.

David Hannah, the chief executive of Reliance Steel and Aluminum, which is the largest steel service center in North America by sales, stated that the worst period for pricing may be over.

U.S. steel producers have been cautious about increasing production in response to the federal stimulus package, expressing uncertainty about the exact timing of steel demand and a desire to avoid undercutting prices that have recently stabilized. Additionally, they noted that they can quickly adjust their production capacity and that existing inventory levels are adequate for immediate sales. Severstal OAO, a Russian steel company, has also reduced production to align capacity with demand. CEO Alexey Mordashov mentioned in a recent statement that the company observed positive signs at the start of this year compared to the last quarter of 2008. The company noted that stimulus plans announced by several national governments are likely to support steel demand in 2009."

        "title": "China at the crossroads: Young, gifted and red - the Communist party's quiet revolution",
        "original_text": "Jerry, a bright undergraduate, has been trying to join for three years. Hope, pursuing a philosophy doctorate, dreams of changing society. Tina just wanted a job. These young, well-educated, cosmopolitan women are the new face of the Communist party: an institution popularly regarded abroad as ageing, male and moribund. It's become commonplace to contrast China's economic revolution with its lack of democratic progress. Since the bloody suppression of 1989's student protests, political reform appears to have stalled. Last week, in posthumously released secret memoirs, Zhao Ziyang – the reformist leader ousted due to that movement – warned that China must move towards western-style democracy. But the party's number two, Wu Bangguo, ruled that out this spring. Censorship is increasingly sophisticated. A groundbreaking intellectual call for reforms, Charter 08, gained thousands of signatures and was quashed; five months on, one of its authors, Liu Xiaobo, remains in detention. Gao Zhisheng, a human rights lawyer, gave a detailed account of torture by the authorities. Now he has simply disappeared. But behind this apparent stasis lies a more complex tale: of an evolving party that has consolidated its iron grip precisely by transforming itself and its relationship with the public. With more than 74 million members – up from 50 million in the early 1990s – it is the largest political party in the world. There are millionaire members, branches in Wal-Marts and plans to open a branch on the first Chinese space station. Senior cadres remain overwhelmingly male, but there is now a compulsory retirement age and even (very low) quotas for women. In recent years, it has concentrated on targeting the best and brightest. The party has largely transformed itself \"from a mass organisation designed for mass mobilisation and ideological campaigns, into a technocratic leadership corps\", said Professor Jeremy Paltiel of Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. Paltiel, an expert on party membership, said that in the 1980s recruits were looked down on by peers as careerists and probably second-rate students. Some elite students still consider the party – with its attendant political meetings – boring and irrelevant. But between 30% and 50% apply to join the party. An approval rate of about 5% reinforces the desirability of membership: recruiters seek those with top grades, leadership potential and youthful idealism – albeit feigned in some cases. To rise through the governmental hierarchy, membership is a must. But it shines out for other employers, too. The draw was not your ideological purity, explained Tina; more the evidence of your accomplishments. \"To be honest I'm a bit embarrassed,\" the graceful 24-year-old admitted with a blush, twining a long strand of hair around her finger. \"Other people joined because they wanted to help the party and country … My main reason was because it was very hard to find a job.\" Spin and polling Outwardly, the party remains rigidly ideological; members are drilled in Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Three Represents and current president Hu Jintao's Scientific Development Outlook. Hu has, in fact, stepped up political education – perhaps because of an evident disconnect: to many, what the party really stands for is personal advancement, social stability and national unity. \"There's a difference between believing in Marxism and being a party member,\" one said drily. For the last two decades, the party's mission had been to \"maintain the brand but change the content\", suggested Anne-Marie Brady, associate professor of political science at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. Experts have been called in to study political change overseas, culling lessons from New Labour and French and German socialists – and using Gorbachev's reforms as an example of what not to do. \"That learning from the west has been brought back into China and used to maintain and enhance the strength of the current political system,\" Brady said. The government has modernised its techniques as well as its cadres. It is now an assiduous user of opinion polling and sophisticated spin techniques, showing greater responsiveness to public opinion. Unlike its models overseas, it does not require votes: but it needs at least tacit support. Allowing people more space to challenge the status quo may, in fact, help to perpetuate the system, providing outlets for frustration and dissent – as long as there are no attempts to organise independently; what the party fears most are alternative power structures. When public outrage becomes widespread and dangerous – over tainted baby milk, for example – authorities often seek to assuage it before stamping it out. Bloggers may be allowed to have their say before the shutters come down. Official heads may roll. New initiatives may be announced. The demands of Chinese citizens have carved out greater – albeit variable – space to criticise lower-ranking officials or hold them to account, engage in public affairs, debate ideas and take part in an emerging civil society. Yet lawyers, activists and dissident intellectuals are routinely harassed and threatened. Even parents who lost their children in the Sichuan earthquake have been bullied and detained for protesting about shoddily built schools. \"If [people] don't touch the line, they can do a lot of things. But there is a line there,\" said Hope. She's a softly spoken, thoughtful young woman, who chooses to meet in an artsy cafe near one of the country's top universities, where as many as two-thirds of her classmates are party members. Like others, she asks to be identified only by her English nickname. But she is candid about her initial hesitation when invited to join, and her ultimate decision to do so. \"It's easy to be a critic, but then maybe you can't change society. You can do more inside the system than without,\" she said. \"Students can see its problems, but still think China can do much better under its leadership. They want to go into the system and maybe make a little change. Maybe some people have an underlying motive: more desire for power. But quite a lot really want to do something to change the country.\" For most, she thought, a priority was freedom of information and the rule of law; only some wanted multi-party elections. \"Chinese people don't hope to go the western way – but hope for a powerful government to restore social justice,\" she suggested. Using the D-word It is hard to generalise about what a diverse nation of 1.3 billion people without freedom of expression really think; and impossible to know what they might believe without government censorship and propaganda. But the Asian Barometer study of political attitudes, the most comprehensive to date, came up with some surprising findings. In mainland China, 53.8% believed a democratic system was preferable. Then came the kicker. Asked how democratic it is now, on a scale of one to 10, the Chinese placed their nation at 7.22 – third in Asia and well ahead of Japan, the Philippines and South Korea. \"Chinese political culture makes people understand democracy in a different way, and this gives the regime much manipulating space,\" concluded Dr Tianjin Shi. To the confusion of some western observers, Hu's speech to the last party congress used the D-word more than 60 times. \"They would like to talk about democracy with Chinese characteristics. My problem is that no one really can offer a definition of what that is,\" said Dr Yawei Liu of the Carter Centre's China Programme, which works with Chinese officials to improve elections and civic education. \"If you look at civic activism, what's taking place in cyberspace and what's going on in 600,000 villages in China [with grassroots elections] they all seem to indicate there's still a push from the top and most importantly from the bottom to expand political reform … The problem is how grassroots efforts could be elevated to a higher level and whether the leadership has the wisdom and courage to move forward with an agenda.\" Since the mushrooming and then suppression of the Tiananmen democracy protests amid a split between reformists and conservatives, China's leaders have concluded that cracks at the top can only lead to disaster. Maintaining consensus – at least in public – has been central to their operation. If anyone is pushing for major reform, it is not evident. Hundreds of millions in China already go to the polls to choose low-level representatives. But efforts to promote and expand village elections – widely lauded in the 1990s – appear to have stalled. Recent experiments, such as the use of deliberative democracy in setting budgets and awarding a greater say in the selection of local party secretaries, offer clues to possible routes towards or alternatives to a multi-party system. Yet so far, they stand alone. Optimists suggest that economic rights lead inevitably to greater hunger for political freedom. But others fear that capitalism has created vested interests that entrench the system. Professor Sun Liping, a sociologist at Tsinghua University – and the doctoral supervisor of vice-president and heir apparent Xi Jinping – warned earlier this year that China's greatest danger was not social instability, as authorities say, but instead \"social decay\", with rising inequality and alienation. \"The fundamental cause … is the marriage between political power and capitalism,\" he wrote. \"The two have joined hands in China … We thought power would be constrained in a market economy. But we have now seen that power has acquired higher value and greater space for exertion.\" If you can't beat 'em \"The economy is improving, society is improving but there is no improvement in elections,\" complained Yao Lifa. He could be the mirror image of Tina and Hope: a 50-year-old, largely self-educated man from the provinces who tried to beat 'em, not join 'em. He began competing for a seat in his local people's congress in Hubei in 1987, when the election law was first promulgated. After 12 years of harassment and dogged campaigning as an independent candidate, he won. Later he was turfed out again. He has been detained on \"at least\" 10 occasions, often for promoting voting rights. The elections are fake, he argues, because the system can't tolerate genuine democratic contests. \"The law only states that people have the right to vote; there are no rules to protect this right. When your right to vote is harmed, you can't even set up a case in the court,\" he said. \"But there is no reason to say western democracy does not fit China. Chinese authorities say people's education level is too low and our economy is still not developed. But how was the economic and educational situation in the west hundreds of years ago?\" How many compatriots share his views is another matter. People in China complain bitterly about official corruption, inefficiency and brutality. But – as the government reminds them – multi-party elections do not guarantee good governance or stability. After decades of turmoil, many seem willing to settle for a quiet life and economic wellbeing – at least for now. There's little sign that the current economic downturn is leading to widespread social unrest – still less open opposition to the government. \"Basically, I think they're doing a very good job,\" Tina said earnestly. \"China's so big, but it's not wealthy. The leadership have helped it develop fast. I looked at the G20 meeting in London and felt kind of proud of the government; foreign countries really hope that China can help. \"Maybe other people think oh, China, there's no freedom. But it's not easy to make everything perfect.\" • This article was amended on 22 May 2009. The original had Anne-Marie Brady saying that the Communist party's mission in recent decades had been to \"maintain the brain but change the content\". This has been corrected.",
        "debiased_text": "Jerry, an undergraduate student, has attempted to join the Communist Party for three years. Hope, who is pursuing a philosophy doctorate, aspires to contribute to societal change. Tina, on the other hand, aimed to secure employment. These young, well-educated women represent a new demographic within the Communist Party, an institution often perceived internationally as aging, male-dominated, and lacking growth. It is common to contrast China's significant economic development with the absence of substantial political reform. Following the suppression of student protests in 1989, political change appears to have slowed. Recently, Zhao Ziyang, a former reformist leader who was removed from power due to the protests, had his memoirs released posthumously, in which he expressed the belief that China should move toward a democracy model similar to that of the West. However, Wu Bangguo, the party's number two official, rejected this idea earlier this year. Censorship mechanisms have become more refined; an intellectual initiative advocating for reforms, known as Charter 08, gained numerous signatures before being stopped. Five months later, one of its signatories, Liu Xiaobo, is still being held in detention. Gao Zhisheng, a human rights lawyer, provided a detailed account of experiencing torture by the authorities. Subsequently, he has not been seen. Behind the perception of stagnation, there is a more nuanced development: the party has adapted by evolving its structure and engaging with the public. With over 74 million members, an increase from 50 million in the early 1990s, it is the world's largest political party. It includes members who are millionaires, branches located in retail stores such as Wal-Mart, and plans to establish a branch on the first Chinese space station. While senior party officials are predominantly male, there are now set retirement ages and minimal quotas in place for female members. In recent years, the party has focused on recruiting individuals who are academically and professionally accomplished. The party has shifted its focus from being a mass organization primarily involved in ideological campaigns to becoming a technocratic leadership body. According to Professor Jeremy Paltiel of Carleton University, in the 1980s, joining the party was often seen as a sign of careerism, and the recruits were perhaps viewed as lower achievers in their academic pursuits. Although some elite students consider the party's political meetings as irrelevant, between 30% and 50% of them apply for membership. With an approval rate of approximately 5%, joining the party is seen as advantageous for career progression within government and also in other sectors. Tina indicated that the allure of membership lies not in ideological commitment, but rather in the demonstration of professional success. For her, the main motivation was the difficulty in securing employment. The party continues to reinforce its ideological framework; members are required to study Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Three Represents, and Hu Jintao's Scientific Development Outlook. Hu has increased the emphasis on political education, likely due to the recognition that the party is primarily perceived as a means for personal advancement, stability, and unity. Anne-Marie Brady, an associate professor at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, suggested that the party has adopted a strategy of 'maintaining the brand but changing the content.' This involves studying political changes abroad and drawing lessons from political groups in the West, such as New Labour, French and German socialists, and even using Gorbachev's reforms as a warning example. The government has also modernized its approach, using opinion polling and public relations techniques to align more with public sentiment. Unlike in other countries, the party is not dependent on public voting for its survival. However, it requires a form of tacit public support. Allowing some degree of public expression of challenges toward the status quo may serve to disperse frustrations and prevent the rise of alternative systems of power, thus preserving the party's authority. When public dissatisfaction occurs, such as with the issue of tainted baby milk, the authorities typically respond before attempting to suppress it. Bloggers may be allowed to express their views to an extent, and officials may be replaced or new initiatives announced. Chinese citizens have, to a certain extent, been granted more space to critique local officials, express opinions, and engage in community activities. However, lawyers, activists, and dissident intellectuals are frequently harassed or threatened. Parents of children who perished in an earthquake have reportedly faced intimidation and detention when they voiced concerns about the quality of construction in schools. Hope, a young woman who chooses to remain anonymous, mentioned that students perceive the party's challenges but still believe that China can significantly improve under its leadership. Many students desire to influence the system from within rather than protest against it. She highlighted that the main aspirations of students were for greater transparency and a robust legal framework, with only some expressing support for multi-party elections. The Asian Barometer study, the most comprehensive of its kind, suggests that a significant portion of the Chinese population believes in the superiority of a democratic system. However, when asked to rate China's current level of democracy on a scale of one to ten, the Chinese population gave it a score of 7.22, placing it third in Asia. Dr. Tianjin Shi indicated that the specific interpretation of democracy within China's culture allows the regime to navigate and manage public perception effectively. During a recent party congress, President Hu Jintao used the term 'democracy' over 60 times, speaking about 'democracy with Chinese characteristics.' Dr. Yawei Liu of the Carter Centre noted the challenge in defining what exactly this entails. While grassroots efforts, even local elections, have taken place, it remains unclear how these initiatives can be elevated or whether the leadership is willing to pursue further political reform. Professor Sun Liping, a sociologist at Tsinghua University and a previous mentor to the current vice president and potential successor, Xi Jinping, warned that China's main threat is 'social decay' rather than instability. He attributed this to the integration of political power and capitalism, which has resulted in the expansion of power, not its limitation. Yao Lifa, a 50-year-old man from the provinces who is primarily self-educated, has actively campaigned for public office as an independent candidate, facing harassment for over a decade. He argues that the elections in China are not genuine but merely symbolic because the system is not prepared to tolerate authentic democratic contests. The law, he noted, guarantees the right to vote but does not provide for protecting these rights. "

        "title": "Wang Yam given 20 years in prison for killing reclusive writer Allan Chappelow",
        "original_text": "A Chinese con man who stole into the ramshackle £4m home of a reclusive pensioner and battered him to death was sentenced to a minimum of 20 years in prison today. Wang Yam killed the eccentric author Allan Chappelow, 86, in his home in Hamsptead, north London, in order to steal his identity and perpetrate fraud. The body of his victim – who had written two biographies of George Bernard Shaw – was found under a metre-high pile of papers in a room filled with rotting furniture. Yam, also of Hampstead, who had been posing as a multimillionaire, denied the killing as well as stealing cheques and bank cards. But a jury at the Old Bailey found him guilty earlier this month of killing Chappelow. Yam had spent a month cloning Chappelow's identity using documents from the house but attempts to get cash failed when his Chinese accent alerted bank staff. The defence case was held in camera for national security reasons and to ensure the administration of justice. A court order bans speculation about the matters heard in private. Chappelow was battered over the head in May 2006 after returning from a trip to the US. The writer seldom left the house he had lived in since he was 14. Interested in photography from a young age, he badgered George Bernard Shaw to let him capture what became the last-known image of the playwright. Sentencing him to life, Mr Justice Ouseley said Yam should serve a minimum jail term of 20 years, giving him concurrent sentences of up to four-and-a-half years for offences of burglary, dishonestly obtaining two bank transfers for £20,000, dishonestly handling four stolen cheques, and theft. Chappelow had been struck five times on the head and received further blows to his neck and body, said the judge. \"They were inflicted on a defenceless man who was semi-conscious at times during the assault. His body was concealed under nearly half a tonne of papers,\" he said, adding that the murder was committed in the course of a burglary during which Yam was stealing mail. He accepted that Yam believed the property was unoccupied and was surprised to be confronted by an angry Chappelow. Geoffrey Cox QC, defending, told the judge that Yam was a mild-mannered man who had reacted uncharacteristically. \"The defendant was under financial pressures and strains at the time. There must have been a serious of other personal pressures which drove him to the mail theft.\" Yam came to Britain \"under a well-founded fear of persecution\" after leading the life of a respected academic in China, said Cox. Officers broke into the derelict Georgian property after being contacted by Chappelow's bank. Staff there had grown concerned when more than £10,000 was withdrawn from his account and when he failed to make his usual weekly deposit. Yam, who claimed to have fled China for Hong Kong following threats after the Tiananmen Square uprising, broke down in the witness box as he denied killing Chappelow. The court went into closed session after he said that after he sought asylum in the UK in 1992, he criticised the Chinese regime on internet blogs. He spent years tricking members of the Chinese community out of money with fake mortgage and insurance deals but victims had not wanted police involved because of their immigration status or belated offers of restitution from Yam.",
        "debiased_text": "A man from China, identified as Wang Yam, was sentenced to a minimum of 20 years in prison for the murder of Allan Chappelow, an 86-year-old author who lived in a residential property in Hampstead, north London. The victim's body was discovered under a pile of papers in a room containing deteriorating furniture. The incident occurred in May 2006 after Chappelow returned from a trip to the United States. Yam, who had been residing in the same area, had been living under a false identity and had been attempting to use Chappelow's identity to commit fraud. During the burglary, Yam inflicted multiple blows to Chappelow's head, neck, and body. The judge noted that the assault occurred while Yam was stealing mail and that the victim was semi-conscious at times during the attack. The property was accessed by police after being alerted by Chappelow's bank, which became concerned due to unusual financial activity, including the withdrawal of over £10,000 and the failure to make a usual weekly deposit. Yam had previously spent years deceiving members of the Chinese community in the UK with fraudulent mortgage and insurance deals. He claimed to have fled China due to threats following his criticism of the Chinese regime on internet blogs and had sought asylum in the UK in 1992. The defence asserted that Yam was a mild-mannered individual who had been driven by financial and personal pressures at the time of the offence. The court proceedings included a closed session to address matters related to national security and the administration of justice."

        "original_text": "$9bn infrastructure project faltering ; Western countries in debt relief threat China's biggest investment deal in Africa is faltering as western donors put pressure on the Democratic Republic of Congo to renegotiate a minerals-for-infrastructure contract valued at $9bn (EUR6.9bn, pound(s)6bn). Under the deal, first announced in 2007 but signed last year, a consortium of state-owned Chinese companies agreed to build roads, railways, hospitals and universities in return for the right to develop a copper and cobalt mine. The plan aimed to allow the country, still recovering from a civil war, to translate its mineral wealth into tangible development. But pressure to alter the deal has come from western donors that will not offer relief on historic debt of $11bn to the cash-strapped government of President Joseph Kabila if it accepts Chinese financing on commercial terms. The global financial crisis has added to the pressure because reduced commodity prices raise questions over how far mining revenues will cover the infrastructure costs. The Congo government wants to refine the deal, but does not want to drive China away, or admit to Congolese voters ahead of a 2011 election that the developmental centrepiece of Mr Kabila's current term is going awry. The IMF has \"urged the [Congolese] authorities to take all actions to ensure that the final agreement [with China] is consistent with debt sustainability\". Both the IMF and World Bank have attempted to persuade the Chinese to consider changes to the deal. \"Changes will come,\" said Victor Kasongo, Congo's deputy minister of mines, adding that the government was awaiting the results of a feasibility study on the \"robustness\" of the project. Mr Kasongo said Congo wanted to ensure the deal met the criteria for \"fair commerce\" and was willing to address donors' concerns. \"Congo has chosen to carry on with the IMF and World Bank economic route and at the same time to pursue development with Chinese money,\" he said. Most western donors have said they support the deal \"in principle\" as it gives Congo access to capital on a scale it could not attain otherwise. But, led by the Paris Club of creditors and the IMF, they have raised objections to specific provisions, such as that the deal would give the Chinese consortium state financial guarantees, including some that would earmark government revenues and make China a privileged creditor. But Wu Zexian, China's ambassador to Congo, said that Beijing was reluctant to forego these. \"They [western institutions] are wrong to ask Congo to remove the state guarantee. That is blackmail,\" he said. \"This is a poor country that needs to develop. Why force the country to modify the clause? \"We cannot accept that. It's discriminatory.\" When the deal was struck China's appetite for copper and cobalt was insatiable, but if it is scaled back or unravels, it would bea turning point in China's quest for African resources, which had threatened to marginalise western donors. \"Now everything depends on the feasibility of the Chinese mine, to ensure that the money we requested for infrastructure and for upgrading the mine won't bring too large a debt burden,\" said Mr Kasongo. The $9bn financing is split into three tranches of $3bn; one for setting up the mining operation and two for nationwide infrastructure investments, including more than 3,500km of roads and nearly 3,000km of railways. Asked what lessons the rest of Africa could draw from Congo's experience with China, Mr Kasongo said: \"Nobody should go it alone. We are the first ones to leave the door open to both of them [China and western institutions] because they are both servicing us.\" China was not concerned about \"short-term\" falls in commodity prices because it was making a long-term investment, he added.",
        "debiased_text": "A $9 billion infrastructure project in the Democratic Republic of Congo, involving a consortium of state-owned Chinese companies, is facing challenges. The agreement, originally announced in 2007 and signed last year, involves the development of roads, railways, hospitals, and universities in exchange for the right to develop a copper and cobalt mine. The agreement aimed to use the country's mineral wealth to support development efforts, particularly in the wake of a civil war. However, Western donors have expressed concerns and are urging the Congolese government to renegotiate the terms of the deal. These donors have indicated that they will not provide relief on the country's $11 billion historical debt unless the government modifies the agreement to avoid accepting Chinese financing on commercial terms. The global financial crisis has increased the challenge, as reduced commodity prices have raised doubts about whether mining revenues will be sufficient to cover infrastructure costs. The Congolese government is seeking to refine the agreement but is cautious about alienating China or admitting to voters that a major development initiative is in jeopardy ahead of the 2011 election. The IMF has called for measures to ensure that the final agreement aligns with debt sustainability. The IMF and World Bank have also attempted to persuade China to consider adjustments to the deal. Victor Kasongo, Congo's deputy minister of mines, stated that the government is awaiting the outcome of a feasibility study assessing the project's robustness and indicated that the government wants to ensure that the deal meets the criteria for fair commerce. He noted that Congo is following the economic guidance of the IMF and World Bank while also pursuing development through Chinese funding. Most Western donors support the deal 'in principle,' as it provides access to capital on a scale otherwise unattainable. However, the Paris Club of creditors and the IMF have raised objections to particular clauses, such as the provision granting the Chinese consortium state financial guarantees, including those that would allocate government revenues and grant China a privileged creditor status. Wu Zexian, China's ambassador to Congo, stated that Beijing is unwilling to remove the state guarantees, calling the request a 'blackmail' and describing it as 'discriminatory.' He emphasized that the deal represents a long-term investment, and that China is not concerned about short-term fluctuations in commodity prices. The $9 billion financing is divided into three tranches of $3 billion each: one for establishing the mining operation and two for nationwide infrastructure investments, including over 3,500 km of roads and nearly 3,000 km of railways. Victor Kasongo also noted that the Congolese government believes the experience could serve as a lesson for other African nations, advising that 'Nobody should go it alone' and that both China and Western institutions can contribute to development."

        "original_text": "Beijing plans record spending package ; Premier Wen's bullish tone lifts markets Chinese premier Wen Jiabao yesterday promised to deliver 8 per cent economic growth and record government spending this year although he failed to outline the new stimulus package many investors had been expecting. In a two-hour speech outlining his \"work report\" to the National People's Congress, China's parliament, Mr Wen said the global financial crisis was deepening but the goal of 8 per cent growth was still realistic. \"The global financial crisis continues to spread and get worse. Demand continues to shrink on international markets; the trend toward global deflation is obvious; and trade protectionism is resurging,\" he said. But, \"as long as we adopt the right policies and appropriate measures and implement them effectively, we will be able to achieve this target\", he added. Global financial markets rose on Wednesday after Chinese officials indicated Mr Wen would introduce a new stimulus plan in his speech. However, Mr Wen did not announce additional measures beyond the Rmb4,000bn ($585bn) \"investment plan\" unveiled in November. He provided few extra details to help clarify how much of that investment would be genuinely new spending and where the money would be allocated. Mr Wen said China would run a budget deficit this year of Rmb950bn, equivalent to nearly 3 per cent of gross domestic product - a record in recent times for China but modest compared with some of the fiscal packages being considered round the world. Indeed, for all the talk about China's big fiscal plans for 2009, the 21 per cent increase in total government expenditures for this year is slower than the 25.4 per cent rise last year. In spite of the lack of new investment plans, the Shanghai market rose a further 1 per cent yesterday as investors were assured by Mr Wen's forecast. \"We see a firm tone to Mr Wen's speech that the government is determined and able to cope with the crisis,\" said Sun Mingchun at Nomura International. Economists said China's relatively low debt levels meant the government could expand its fiscal stimulus over the course of the year if there were few signs of recovery. Jia Kang, researcher at the finance ministry, also hinted at measures to come. \"China may have to widen the fiscal deficit further if the economic situation continues to be weak in the second quarter,\" he told reporters. Central government spending on education is scheduled to rise 24 per cent and on healthcare by 38 per cent although Beijing funds only a part of these services, the rest coming from local governments. Investment in low-income housing will rise 171 per cent to Rmb49.3bn this year. The central government will also issue Rmb200bn of bonds to finance provincial budgets. Local governments are not allowed to issue bonds on their own behalf. In recent weeks, there have been tentative signs of the Chinese economy starting to stabilise after a slowdown in the fourth quarter.

        "original_text": "The hottest debate over the world economy is not on the fate of America; it's on the fate of China. Will it be the worst victim, or the most successful survivor, of the global crisis of 2009? So far the news all points to success, as the Asian giant defies the old assumption that an American recession would trigger a Chinese depression. Long dependent on exports to America, China continues to grow strongly despite a collapse of exports, down 26.4 percent in May alone. The reason is growth at home, with retail sales up 15.2 percent in May, and house and car sales taking off. To some, this is evidence that China has hit a new state of development, emerging as a consumer society wealthy enough to rival America as the world's best customer, and in some ways it has. The problem is that the consumer driving the boom is not the individual, because the Chinese shopper has been in retreat in recent years. The real big spender is the government. China's economic recovery is real, but it's been bought by the state. No political party in the world can spend quite as freely right now as China's Communist Party, with its nearly $2 trillion in reserves and budget authority unchecked by rival parties or institutions. Beijing's stimulus plan amounts to 4 percent of GDP, double America's 2 percent, and China can deliver this booster shot without resorting to foreign borrowing. Government investment has driven the Chinese boom for a long time, and it is up 30 percent since the beginning of the year, with 75 percent of the money going into infrastructure; spending on rail lines and roads has more than doubled over the past 12 months. New community centers, convention halls, and sports facilities are springing up in major cities and provinces. Central and local governments are raising subsidies to support idle factories, retrain workers, and boost income aid in hard-hit areas. New government lending, as well as government orders to banks to raise lending, is helping to spur a surge in apartment sales. The state is even handing out spending vouchers directly to consumers, particularly in rural areas, good for cars, refrigerators, and other products, many with price restrictions that effectively limit the vouchers to inexpensive Chinese brands. As a top executive at one Chinese state-owned bank puts it, \"This is all about the government propping things up.\" The hidden hand of the state can obscure the degree to which China still depends on subsidized exports to America. Among the hardest-hit areas are those such as Guangdong province, a southern factory hub that represents an eighth of China's wealth and a quarter of its exports. There five-star hotels built in the boom times stand empty, while job centers for laid-off migrant workers are full. On a recent evening, the Pearl River itself seemed dimmer-many of the garish light displays that usually blaze from waterfront inns and restaurants had been turned off \"to save electricity,\" says Su Caifang, deputy director general of the Guangdong Foreign Affairs Office, who notes that the province has suffered greatly in recent months because of the global downturn. \"We're still very export-dependent, especially on America,\" says Su, who notes that 40 percent of the region's exports go to the U.S. It's an honest admission that undercuts all the talk about an emerging middle-class Chinese consumer poised to take the place of Wal-Mart moms. Chinese incomes are about one tenth of those in America, and total consumer spending was about $1.7Â trillion in 2007, compared with $12 trillion in the U.S. Local officials in the Pearl River Delta say they are now traveling inland to Hunan or Sichuan province to sell to their own countrymen the consumer electronics, jewelry, and shoes they once sent abroad. Yet local sales are a drop in the bucket compared with exports. There's a growing sense that the U.S. market will take years to rebound-while the Chinese market will take a long time to reach critical mass. \"Even before the financial crisis, we knew we needed to move beyond the U.S. market,\" says Allan S.K. Lam, vice general manager of Hua Jian Group, a shoe manufacturer that makes much of what you see in stores like Nine West, Kenneth Cole, and Coach. \"But it's going to take at least five years, perhaps even eight years, to develop the Chinese domestic market in an important way.\" What's more, Chinese consumers have been playing a less important role in the economy in recent years. Private consumption has been steadily declining for some time, going from more than 60 percent of GDP in 1968 to 36 percent of GDP in 2008, a trend that defies the typical image of China's booming middle class. The biggest reason for this is increasing worry over the country's lack of a social safety net (pensions are rare; medical care means money down at the door). But freedom may play a role: a recent Carnegie Endowment study looking at political freedom and consumption found that countries that became less free over the last 20 years, like China, Iran, and Venezuela, had a significant drop in consumption. The retreat of the Chinese shopper worries people like Stephen Roach, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, who says consumption needs to reach 50 percent of GDP for China to really move beyond the export model. \"There's no paradigm shift,\" says Roach, adding that state investment could rise from 40 percent of GDP to 45 percent by the end of this year, levels \"we've never seen.\" Even when Japan was rebuilding after World War II, its investments reached only 34 percent of GDP. And while Japan was generating double-digit growth with that cash, Chinese leaders admit they will be lucky to hit the 7 to 8 percent target this year. Locals in Guangdong say the view from the ground is less optimistic than the official projections. \"I've talked to a number of factory owners in the area, and they tell me if they can't get more orders in six weeks they may go out of business,\" says Ding Li, director of the Center for Regional and Corporate Competitiveness Research at the Guangdong Academy of Social Sciences. Of course, the government can always intervene. Just look what it's done in Shenzhen, a Pearl River Delta city that, if the market had run its course, might be in just as bad shape as neighboring Dongguan, where by some estimates one out of every 10 factories is now shuttered. Shenzhen, a mere 97 kilometers away, is a vision of how government support can remake a city. Thirty years ago it was a paddy field. Then Deng Xiaoping decided to turn it into a manufacturing base, which today has an economy nearly half the size of its older and more glamorous neighbor Hong Kong. Most recently the government decided to place China's version of the NASDAQ there, spurring more new development. Many of the bourgeois trappings found in Shenzhen today-hyper-air-conditioned shopping malls, mock-Disney weekend resorts and nonsmoking coffee bars-were built by OCT (Overseas China Town), one of the earliest central-government-owned real-estate operations. Since 1985 the company has developed $8.7 billion worth of real estate. Still, many public spaces are conspicuously empty. On one recent evening, a vast -California-style shopping mall filled with Chinese versions of upscale Western brands (Aqua-scu-tum, Hugo Boss) attracted only a smattering of visitors. Still, Beijing builds on. A new state-owned luxury condo development called Portofino works improbably to bring la dolce vita to south China, with cobbled streets, broad piazzas, and a terra-cotta clock tower that chimes on the hour. A government representative claims 80 percent occupancy, and says that the $30,000-to-$50,000 flats in the development are selling to upwardly mobile, well--educated Chinese, many of them returning expats who see better job opportunities here than in the West. Yet the fake piazzas are deserted, and the majority of the comments on the message board of the local French-pastry shop are in English. While officials won't comment, it seems likely that a number of the properties are owned by or leased to Westerners. China's heavily centralized state has spent its way to recovery before-during the Asian financial crisis of 1997--98, and also after the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2001. But in both hose cases, government money was a stopgap, meant to buy time while the global economy (and exports) recovered. This time is different. The U.S. and, to a lesser extent, Europe are on the road to recovery. Yet exports are not coming back, which means that jobs for the 20 million Chinese migrant workers already laid off may not come back either. In fact, UBS bank estimates that the ranks of the unemployed may grow by another 15 million this year, as the export dip plays itself out. This doesn't necessarily translate into seething social discontent, as is often written. The migrants will be going back to their villages with a lot more than they left with. But in the mid- to long term, it raises pressure on China to find a new model. \"I just don't see it happening,\" says Roach. \"That's why I'm worried about another dip in growth next year.\" Optimists point to Beijing's power of the purse. \"The Chinese Communist Party is now the world's most liquid financial institution; there are no fiscal constraints,\" says Andy Rothman, a respected China bull at CLSA in Shanghai, who predicts 7 to 9 percent growth next year. Most economists agree that autocracy has its advantages in the midst of a credit crunch, since there are no political or legal obstacles to spending. As an executive at one of China's largest state-owned banks puts it, \"The government told us to lend-so we did!\" Yet already there are concerns about where all the new capital is going. Moody's and other ratings agencies are worried about a future rise in bad loans in China, given the explosion in bank lending. And since much of the new lending has gone to business, rather than consumers, it may be recycled among enterprises without trickling down more broadly to the consumer level, where it's most needed. While consumer-spending growth figures look high, even bulls like Rothman say the numbers are inflated to more than double the true level because government purchases at retail shops are included in the figures. China has begun to create a social safety net, which would give people more confidence to spend instead of save, if it were not so full of holes. A few months back Beijing passed a $127 billion nation-al health-insurance plan, to be delivered over three years. That's less than 50 bucks a head in China-\"just puny,\" says Roach. Meanwhile, China's social-security fund has only $82 billion under management, less than $100 per worker. Economists believe the numbers should be doubled immediately, and China could afford to do it. Yet Beijing has been talking about tightening social safety nets since 2006, with little action. Even Chinese are skeptical about Premier Wen Jiabao's boast to deliver universal health care by 2011. Of course, increasing affluence would also help encourage consumer spending-the per capita GDP in China is still only $2,000. But that would necessitate moving up from cheap, polluting industries to global Chinese brands. Right now most Chinese exports are merely assembled in China, rather than designed and branded there, which means most of the profit, and the big salaries, goes to foreign partners. Throughout Guangdong, where many exporters are based, officials and factory bosses claim to be working toward designing and producing more -sophisticated finished goods, but the statistics tell a different story. Some 60 percent of production in the region is still low-end component assembly. And until China becomes an advanced export power it will remain a backward consumer society, where any green shoots are pushed up by the state.",
        "debiased_text": "The debate regarding the global economy centers on China's economic resilience during the 2009 global crisis. Initial reports suggest China has managed to maintain economic growth despite a significant decline in exports, which fell by 26.4 percent in May. This growth is attributed to domestic factors such as increased retail sales, which rose by 15.2 percent in May, and heightened sales of housing and cars. Some observers believe this indicates China's transition into a more consumer-driven economy. However, the primary driver of this growth is government spending rather than individual consumption. The Chinese Communist Party has implemented a substantial economic stimulus program, equivalent to 4 percent of GDP, which is double the percentage of the United States' stimulus plan. This government-led initiative does not require foreign borrowing and has significantly increased infrastructure investment, with 75 percent of the funds directed toward this sector. There has been a notable increase in government-supported projects, including new community centers, convention halls, and sports facilities, as well as increased subsidies to support idle factories, retrain workers, and assist those affected by the economic downturn. Government-backed lending and directives to banks have led to a surge in apartment sales, and spending vouchers are being distributed directly to consumers, especially in rural regions, aimed at boosting demand for consumer goods. A top executive at a Chinese state-owned bank noted that this is an example of government intervention to stabilize the economy. Despite these measures, there is an ongoing reliance on export subsidies, particularly in areas such as Guangdong province, a major industrial hub representing an eighth of China's overall wealth and a quarter of its exports, which are heavily directed toward the United States. Local officials in this region have stated that they are now attempting to sell consumer products domestically that were previously exported. However, domestic sales are still a small fraction of the export market. There are discussions about the time needed for the domestic market to reach a critical mass, with estimates ranging from five to eight years. Recent data shows a decline in private consumption as a percentage of GDP, which dropped from over 60 percent in 1968 to 36 percent in 2008, which contradicts the popular perception of a rapidly expanding Chinese middle class. Factors contributing to this decline include concerns related to the lack of a comprehensive social safety net, such as limited access to pensions and out-of-pocket medical expenses. Additionally, a study by the Carnegie Endowment suggested that the decline in political freedom in certain countries, including China, has resulted in a significant drop in consumption. Some analysts, such as Stephen Roach, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, suggest that for China to shift away from its export-based model, private consumption must account for at least 50 percent of GDP. They express concerns about the Chinese economy's future, citing expectations that government investment could reach 45 percent of GDP, a level not previously reported. In areas like Dongguan in Guangdong, estimates suggest that one in ten factories has closed, which has led to an increase in unemployment. Although there are reports of government intervention, for example, in Shenzhen, where substantial development projects have been undertaken, these have not yet translated into significant foot traffic within public spaces. Some developments in Shenzhen, intended to mirror Western urban aesthetics, have faced challenges in attracting local consumers. Despite the Chinese government's substantial financial capacity and potential for future economic growth, concerns linger regarding the effectiveness of social safety net improvements and the inflation of consumer spending figures. A recent national health-insurance plan, which will be implemented over three years, is perceived as insufficient, with per capita funding remaining low. Additionally, efforts to transition from low-end manufacturing to higher-value industries have not yet fully materialized, as approximately 60 percent of production in regions like Guangdong is still concentrated in basic component assembly. This situation suggests that China's move toward becoming a more advanced export and consumer economy is still in progress, and the current economic boom is primarily supported by state expenditures."

        "original_text": "Tropical forests may dry out and become vulnerable to devastating wildfires as global warming accelerates over the coming decades, a senior scientist has warned. Soaring greenhouse gas emissions, driven by a surge in coal use in countries such as China and India, are threatening temperature rises that will turn damp and humid forests into parched tinderboxes, said Dr Chris Field, co-chair of the UN's Nobel prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Higher temperatures could see wildfires raging through the tropics and a large scale melting of the Arctic tundra, releasing billions of tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere that will accelerate warming even further, he said. Field, director of global ecology at the Carnegie Institute, told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Chicago at the weekend that the IPCC's last report on climate change in 2007 had substantially underestimated the severity of global warming over the rest of the century. The report concluded that the Earth's temperature is likely to rise between 1.1C and 6.4C by 2100, depending on future global carbon emissions. \"We now have data showing that from 2000 to 2007, greenhouse gas emissions increased far more rapidly than we expected, primarily because developing countries, like China and India, saw a huge upsurge in electric power generation, almost all of it based on coal,\" Field said. The next report, which Field will oversee, is due in 2014 and will now include future scenarios where global warming is far more serious than previous reports have suggested, he said. Field said that if the tropics became dry enough for fires to break out, tropical forests would pass a \"tipping point\" from absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to releasing it. \"Tropical forests are essentially inflammable. You couldn't get a fire to burn there if you tried. But if they dry out just a little, the result can be very large and destructive wildfires. It is increasingly clear that as you produce a warmer world, lots of forested areas that had been acting as carbon sinks could be converted to carbon sources,\" he said. The result could lead to runaway warming. Field's warning was echoed by French scientists, who said the IPCC's estimate that sea levels would rise around 40cm by 2100 was likely to be a best case scenario. Former US vice-president Al Gore, who spoke at the meeting on Friday night, called for a globally coordinated stimulus to tackle climate change. \"We've now reached the stage where continuing on our present course will threaten the entirety of human civilisation,\" he said. • This article was amended on Thursday 19 February 2009. We quoted a scientist describing tropical forests as \"essentially inflammable\". Inflammable means \"liable to catch fire\" (Collins); non-flammable was meant.",

Dr Chris Field, co-chair of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), stated that rising greenhouse gas emissions, particularly due to increased coal usage in countries like China and India, could lead to temperature increases that transform humid forests into dry environments prone to fires. He mentioned that higher temperatures could result in widespread wildfires in the tropics and significant melting of the Arctic tundra, releasing large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, which may further accelerate warming. Field, who is the director of global ecology at the Carnegie Institute, presented these findings at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Chicago. He noted that the IPCC's 2007 report on climate change had underestimated the extent of global warming for the remainder of the century.

The next IPCC report, which Field will help oversee, is expected to be released in 2014 and will include scenarios where global warming is more severe than previously indicated. Field discussed the possibility that if tropical forests become sufficiently dry to allow fires, they could reach a critical point where they transition from absorbing carbon dioxide to releasing it. This could lead to increased carbon emissions and further warming. The warning was supported by French scientists, who indicated that the IPCC's estimate of a 40cm sea level rise by 2100 may be on the lower side of projections.

        "original_text": "Fighting talk, at last, from Rio Tinto. Sam Walsh, chief executive of the iron ore division, has described reports of bribery by employees as \"wholly without foundation\". Almost a fortnight after its head of iron ore in China was pinched, along with three colleagues, it was high time for a t ougher line from the miner. Kevin Rudd, Australian prime minister, had been landing all the punches; it is wise for him to take a step back, following Beijing's warning to Canberra to keep out of its affairs. But Rio should have its dander up anyway. Its refusal to budge on annual contract negotiations with Cisa, the representative body for Chinese steel mills, has been vindicated by spot markets. The higher prices rise above the level agreed with Japanese, Korean and European customers - the margin is currently about 17 per cent - the more outlandish Cisa's claims for a deeper cut look. Yes, exports to its most important customer nation could suffer, in theory. But volumes were already falling before all this blew up - presumably as China worked through stockpiles. Data from Australia's Port Hedland , which handles shipments for the big miners, show aggregate iron ore volumes to China fell to 9.4m tonnes in June from 10.6m in May. So what? Exports to Japan almost doubled to 2.2m tonnes. Rio's iron ore operations in the Pilbara were flat out during the second quarter. Output was a record 53m tonnes, 11 per cent better than last year. When nine of the world's top 10 economies are officially contracting, volumes such as these are remarkable. Since Stern Hu had his collar felt, Rio's shares have gained 11 per cent, while the price of protecting its debt against default has fallen by 9 per cent. Investors have shrugged off the consequences of a diplomatic dust-up. So should Mr Walsh.",
        "debiased_text": "Sam Walsh, chief executive of the iron ore division of Rio Tinto, has stated that reports of employee bribery are 'wholly without foundation.' This came almost two weeks after the company's head of iron ore in China and three colleagues were detained. Walsh suggested it was time for the miner to take a stronger stance. Kevin Rudd, the Australian prime minister, had previously been vocal about the issue; however, following a warning from Beijing to Australia to refrain from intervening in Chinese affairs, Rudd has taken a more restrained approach. Rio Tinto's position in negotiations with Cisa, the representative body for Chinese steel mills, has been supported by recent developments in the spot market. As iron ore prices rise above the levels previously agreed upon with Japanese, Korean, and European customers, currently yielding a margin of approximately 17 percent, Cisa's demands for further reductions appear less substantiated. Although there is a potential for reduced exports to China, the most significant customer, such a decline is not unprecedented. Data from Australia's Port Hedland, which manages shipments for large mining companies, indicates that iron ore volumes sent to China dropped to 9.4 million tonnes in June from 10.6 million tonnes in May. At the same time, exports to Japan nearly doubled to 2.2 million tonnes. Rio Tinto's Pilbara iron ore operations achieved record production in the second quarter, with output reaching 53 million tonnes, a 11 percent increase compared to the previous year. These figures are notable given that nine of the world's top 10 economies are reportedly experiencing contraction. Following the detention of Stern Hu, Rio Tinto's shares increased by 11 percent, while the cost of insuring its debt against default decreased by 9 percent. Investors have not significantly reacted to the diplomatic issues arising from the situation."

        "original_text": "When Richard Nixon visited China in 1972, the distance travelled seemed greater than the 7,000 miles from Washington to Beijing. He was bridging the gap between two worlds that had been sealed off from one another for an entire generation. When China's leaders land in Washington today for the US-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, they will arrive as well-known colleagues on a well-travelled route. But while the gulf between the two nations may have narrowed, the challenges before us have only grown. Back then, a handshake between Nixon and Chinese premier Zhou Enlai was enough to change the world. Today, the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitter and history's biggest emitter, China and America, must change the world again - and nothing less than a transformation of the energy economy will suffice. The question is, can we forge a partnership bold enough to prevent a climate catastrophe? With December's make-or-break climate talks in Copenhagen looming, the US-China negotiations are an important test. Because other countries will take their cues from us, a successful global climate deal will depend on America and China signalling our seriousness now. The good news is that, two decades after Nasa scientist Jim Hansen first warned Congress of the threat, the House has passed landmark climate legislation. I am working with Senator Barbara Boxer on a Senate version. America is transforming itself from laggard to leader. It is well known that China refuses to accept binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Less well known is that China is rapidly embracing clean energy solutions - in some cases outpacing the US. On my visit to China in May, I met with leaders who, until recently, had not been willing to entertain this discussion. Now they are unequivocal that China grasps the urgency and is ready to be a \"positive, constructive\" player in international climate change negotiations. Yes, we want more than promises from China - the world's largest emitter must eventually accept binding reductions. But it would be a mistake to focus single-mindedly on what China has said it will not do. Even as we push China to go further, we must deepen our collaboration on what China can and will do now. We are already cooperating on clean energy. An energy efficiency programme at two steel plants in Shandong, run in partnership with a US laboratory, grew into a China-wide programme covering a thousand enterprises. Stories such as this convinced the Chinese leadership to embrace a 10-year framework for US-China energy cooperation, and led to the agreement to build joint clean energy research centres, signed this month. Now we need to extend these partnerships to climate change. This week's talks provide the most significant forum for advancing US-China cooperation on issues ranging from finance to security. Climate belongs at the forefront of the agenda. In additional to formalising our research and development partnership, we should use this dialogue to collaborate on high-profile clean energy demonstration projects that show the world that the technology of the future is already here. We can jointly commercialise new technologies such as carbon capture and storage and concentrated solar power. We must also train specialised workers. Transforming our energy use cannot happen in Washington and Beijing alone - it must be carried out by engineers and technicians in cities and villages across both nations. Our relationship with China must be a blueprint for future collaboration. We need to engage in the same dialogue with countries such as India to convince them that all of us are worse off when nations shift the blame instead of sharing the burden. A century before Nixon's visit, the Chinese leapfrogged technologies and bypassed the telegram - which was impractical for the Chinese system of writing - to embrace a new US invention: the telephone. Today we need China to forgo the carbon-intensive industrial processes that fuelled the west in the 19th and 20th centuries and to pioneer the clean technologies of the 21st. Sceptics are right that if China does not reciprocate, our domestic efforts will be for naught. But surely, with our climate at stake, America and China's differences demand broader and deeper climate co-operation, not less. The writer is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee",
        "debiased_text": "In 1972, Richard Nixon visited China, marking a significant moment in international relations as the distance between the United States and China seemed greater than the physical 7,000 miles between Washington and Beijing. At that time, the relationship between the two nations had been largely isolated for a generation. Today, as Chinese leaders arrive in Washington for the US-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, they are regarded as familiar counterparts on a frequently used diplomatic path. Although the gap between the two countries has seemingly narrowed, new challenges have emerged. In 1972, a handshake between Nixon and Chinese premier Zhou Enlai had a profound impact on global relations. Now, with the United States and China being the top two greenhouse gas emitters, the need for cooperative efforts on climate change is paramount. The question arises whether the two nations can establish a partnership capable of preventing a climate catastrophe. With climate negotiations in Copenhagen in December, the US-China dialogue is an important opportunity to demonstrate commitment. Other countries are likely to follow the lead of the United States and China, making it essential that both nations signal their dedication to global climate agreements. In recent years, the United States has taken steps in addressing climate change, as the House of Representatives passed significant climate legislation. Efforts are currently underway with Senator Barbara Boxer to draft a Senate version. China has not accepted binding emissions reductions, but it has been increasingly adopting clean energy solutions, sometimes more quickly than the United States. During a visit to China in May, discussions with leaders who had previously been reluctant to address the topic revealed that they now recognize the urgency of climate change and are willing to participate as a constructive player in global climate negotiations. While the United States seeks more than just promises from China, it is important not to focus solely on what China has refused to do. Current collaboration in clean energy efforts should be expanded. The two nations are already cooperating on clean energy projects, such as an energy efficiency initiative at two steel plants in Shandong, which was conducted in partnership with a US laboratory and later extended to a nationwide program involving a thousand enterprises. These successes helped to establish a ten-year framework for US-China energy cooperation, which recently led to the creation of joint clean energy research centers. Now, these partnerships need to be extended to address climate change. This week's dialogue offers a significant opportunity to enhance cooperation on various issues including finance and security, with climate change as a priority topic. In addition to strengthening the research and development partnership, the dialogue should also be used to work on high-profile clean energy projects that demonstrate the availability of future technologies. Tackling challenges like carbon capture and storage and concentrated solar power through joint commercialization efforts could be beneficial. Training specialized personnel is also necessary to support the implementation of clean energy initiatives. Engineers and technicians in various cities and villages across both countries need to be involved for successful transformation of energy use. A century prior to Nixon's visit, China adopted new technologies, moving directly from the telegram to the telephone, which was more suitable for their system of writing. Today, China is encouraged to transition away from carbon-intensive industrial processes and to lead in the development of clean 21st-century technologies. Critics are correct in noting that without corresponding efforts from China, the United States' domestic actions alone will not be sufficient. However, given the global implications of climate change, it is crucial for American and Chinese leaders to pursue broader and deeper cooperation on climate issues, despite their differences."

        "title": "World News: Industry Pushes New Iron-Ore Pricing Plan --- China's Detention of Rio Tinto Workers Hastens Effort by Miners, Steelmakers to Increase Market's Transparency; World News: Industry Pushes New Iron-Ore Pricing Plan --- China's Detention of Rio Tinto Workers Hastens Effort by Miners, Steelmakers to Increase Market's Transparency",
        "original_text": "The world's biggest miners and steelmakers are on the brink of forging a new system for setting iron-ore prices that is expected to increase the volatility of steel prices, but perhaps make the process more tansparent. The effort comes at a time of tension between miners and their biggest iron-ore customer, China. The new system would set iron-ore contract prices on a quarterly basis -- rather than annually as it is currently. Quarterly sales of iron ore -- used almost exclusively to make steel -- is likely to mean global steel prices will be more volatile. Theoretically, steelmakers would pass on any lower prices to their buyers and raise them in the reverse. They also might be likely to rely more on market supply and demand, and less on secretive criteria, as currently is the case. The agreement could be in place as soon as year's end, according to miners and steelmakers involved in crafting the deal. Neither side is commenting; negotiations are secret. Miners and steelmakers are in a battle for power for control of iron-ore prices. Over the past few years, the commodity boom has given most of the power to miners, who constantly raised prices. But since the global economy slowed late last year, steelmakers, particularly in China, have been pressuring for lower prices. Last year, steelmakers were locked into annual pacts when the price of iron ore fell. The spot price of iron ore is about $80 a metric ton, compared with this time last year when prices topped $120 a metric ton. Steelmakers are betting the price will continue to fall, and so prefer longer-term contracts. Likewise, big buyers of steel, such as auto makers, prefer longer-term agreements when prices are favorable because it allows them to rely on a predictable amount of steel coming into their plants, ensuring efficient operations. The current process largely involves one miner negotiating behind closed doors with one big steel maker. All miners and steelmakers generally adopt the outcome from those annual negotiations. For miners, the proposed changes may make profits fluctuate. But in the long run, the short-term pacts could shake out high-cost ore producers. Ian Ashby, chief of the iron-ore division at Australia-based BHP Billiton, the world's largest miner, says lower-cost producers of iron ore, such as his company, function better in a quarterly system. \"The spot market is where buyers and sellers meet to find the true market price for iron ore,\" said Mr. Ashby, quoted in a transcript from a bank-investors meeting in Australia in May. \"From my perspective it should be clear to everyone that the changed market dynamics, created by China's voracious appetite for iron ore over the past five years or so, makes obsolete a system whereby pricing is locked in for 12 months, based on little or no transparency.\" BHP Billiton has been pushing to abolish the current iron-ore pricing system. Brazil's Vale S.A., meanwhile, has lobbied to keep the current annual contracting system. Brazilian ore is more expensive than Australian ore, so is at a disadvantage in spot pricing. Rio Tinto, based in the U.K. and Australia, which sells about half of its iron ore on the spot market, hasn't taken a strong public stance. Changes to the pricing system have been in the works for at least a year, but they were hastened by China's detainment of four Rio Tinto executives, which has spooked miners, who want to placate their biggest customer. Australia's foreign minister, Stephen Smith, said Chinese officials told him the detention stems from a criminal investigation into iron-ore price negotiations, not into espionage. Mr. Smith's recounting Sunday of comments made by Chinese officials appeared at odds with previous statements by Beijing on the case of Stern Hu, an Australian citizen, and three Chinese colleagues at Rio Tinto. China detained the four on July 5, and has alleged the employees used bribery to obtain \"state secrets\" and damaged China's \"economic security.\" Those early statements suggested the case was being treated as something beyond a criminal investigation. It wasn't clear from Mr. Smith's remarks whether China is changing its position. Mr. Smith said the legal situation facing the Rio Tinto employees would become clearer should China's investigation result in charges against Mr. Hu and the others. Rio on Friday issued its strongest denial so far in the case. Sam Walsh, the company's chief executive of iron ore, said in a statement that allegations that its employees were involved in bribery are \"wholly without foundation.\" The company believes the employees \"acted at all times with integrity and in accordance with Rio Tinto's strict and publicly stated code of ethical behavior,\" the statement said. China's largest steelmakers are state-owned enterprises, so information about them could, theoretically, be considered a state secret. To be sure, the pending changes are not a panacea. There likely will still be a fair amount of secretive dealing. The buying and selling of iron ore differs from most minerals and metals. Sales of aluminum and copper, for example, are based on an exchange system, such as the London Metals Exchange, which, in theory, shows both sides the current demand and price for a particular metal or mineral. --- Enda Curran in Sydney contributed to this article.",
        "debiased_text": "The world's largest miners and steelmakers are reportedly working on a new system for setting iron-ore prices. The system is expected to result in more frequent quarterly contract price adjustments, rather than the current annual basis. This change may lead to increased volatility in global steel prices. The proposed system would likely rely more on market supply and demand factors, as opposed to the current secretive pricing criteria. The agreement could be implemented as early as the end of the year, according to those involved in the negotiations, although both parties have not publicly commented on the matter. The effort to change the pricing system comes amid discussions between miners and steelmakers, particularly in relation to China, the largest consumer of iron ore. In recent years, miners have had greater influence over pricing due to a commodity boom, but with the slowdown in the global economy, steelmakers have been seeking lower prices. Last year, steelmakers were bound by annual contracts even as iron-ore prices declined. The spot price of iron ore is currently around $80 per metric ton, compared to over $120 per metric ton at the same time last year. Steelmakers are anticipating further declines in prices and are therefore favoring longer-term contracts to ensure predictable supply. Auto makers and other major steel buyers also prefer longer-term contracts when prices are advantageous. The existing pricing mechanism mainly involves individual miners negotiating with major steelmakers, with the results typically followed by other participants in the industry. For miners, the proposed quarterly system may lead to more fluctuating profits, but could potentially eliminate high-cost producers over time. Ian Ashby, head of the iron-ore division at BHP Billiton, the world's largest miner, stated in a May transcript from an investor meeting in Australia that the spot market reflects the true market price and that the existing annual system lacks transparency. BHP Billiton has been advocating for the replacement of the current pricing system. In contrast, Brazil's Vale S.A. has supported maintaining the annual contracting approach. Brazilian iron ore is generally more expensive than Australian ore, which may place it at a disadvantage in the spot market. Rio Tinto, a major iron-ore producer based in the U.K. and Australia, which sells approximately half of its iron ore on the spot market, has not publicly taken a strong position on the proposed changes. Negotiations for updating the pricing system have been ongoing for at least a year, but were accelerated following the detention of four Rio Tinto executives by Chinese authorities on July 5. The Chinese government alleged that the employees had used bribery to gain access to 'state secrets' and had compromised China's 'economic security.' Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith stated that Chinese officials informed him that the detention was related to a criminal investigation into iron-ore price negotiations, not espionage. This account appears to differ from earlier statements made by Chinese authorities regarding the case involving Stern Hu, an Australian citizen, and his three Chinese colleagues. Smith noted that the legal status of the Rio Tinto employees would become clearer if the investigation leads to formal charges. Rio Tinto has issued its strongest denial to date, stating that allegations of bribery are 'wholly without foundation.' The company emphasized that the employees 'acted at all times with integrity and in accordance with Rio Tinto's strict and publicly stated code of ethical behavior.' State-owned enterprises in China are the largest steel producers, and information related to them could be considered a state secret. However, the proposed changes to the pricing system are not expected to completely eliminate secretive dealings. Unlike some other minerals and metals, such as aluminum and copper, which are traded on exchanges like the London Metals Exchange, iron-ore transactions are not generally conducted through such platforms."

        "original_text": "BEIJING -- As some 200 million or more Chinese head home this weekend to celebrate the Lunar New Year -- most of them migrant workers -- they are facing an unprecedented crisis: unemployment and a fraying safety net. The annual holiday is a time for far-flung families to gather together, look back over the past year and plan for the future. For rural Chinese it is something more: a time to make concrete plans about where they will work next year. In years past, many have returned home flush with cash from their distant adventures, and set out after the holiday with new migrants in tow. But this year, many are heading home with no prospect of returning to their jobs. Chinese media report that upwards of 10 million former migrant workers have been back on the farm already for weeks, as factories have shuttered and summarily fired their employees. In central China's Zhenyang County, for example, 25,000 migrants returned home in December -- more than 60% of the migrant labor force in the area -- after losing their factory jobs. The impact is already painful. For Cai Qin, a 35-year-old factory worker from a village in China's impoverished southwestern province of Guizhou, Spring Festival has been a joyous family occasion ever since she set out with her husband for the coast seven years ago. The couple's combined wages have risen to 2,000 yuan, or $292, a month, and they have used their savings to build a house and pay for high-school tuition for Ms. Cai's brother-in-law. But this year, their homecoming has been bittersweet. The toy factory near Hong Kong where Ms. Cai and her husband worked closed in November, sending the couple home early. In previous years, they would return with clothes and other gifts, but this time they arrived empty-handed. \"We don't know what to do after the holidays,\" Ms. Cai said. \"Our heads hurt just to think about it.\" Cases like this are causing serious concerns about social stability in China, where rural residents still make up most of the population. Rural incomes have risen sixfold since 1990, according to official Chinese data. Income from work off the farm has become increasingly important to most rural households. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, 1,596 yuan, or 39%, of per capita annual income of the nation's rural households, came from wages in 2007, up from 20% in 1990. \"In past years, regardless of how miserable their situation was, migrants had upward mobility,\" says Dorothy Solinger, a professor at the University of California in Irvine, who studies China's internal migration. \"Now it's potentially downward mobility.\" That poses a challenge to the Communist Party, which has staked its legitimacy on delivering three decades of high-speed growth. Already, concerned governments are responding with programs to keep unemployed migrants busy. In southern Guangdong province, China's export engine where thousands of manufacturers have gone out of business, the provincial labor bureau released regulations in December requiring local governments to create jobs or provide necessary assistance to laid-off migrant workers. The bureau also started providing free job services and training courses for the unemployed, and financial assistance for those who want to start their own businesses. Experts warn, however, against predicting massive unrest. Chinese peasants are resilient and have an informal network of help, ranging from extended families to strong informal obligations in villages for the wealthy to help out the poor. \"It will be a very difficult time,\" says Wang Chunguang, an expert on migration at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, \"but I don't expect serious problems with social instability.\" At the Beijing West Railway Station on Wednesday, migrant workers waiting for trains to go home for the New Year were optimistic, even though they anticipate having much more difficulty finding new jobs when they return next month. \"I'm sure I will find something here,\" said Zhai Yuanhui, a farmer from Peicundian village in Henan province who has spent three years in Beijing doing odd jobs to earn more money for his family. \"I can make about 1,000 yuan per month in Beijing just doing small jobs here and there. . . . Before coming here I was lucky to earn 2,000 yuan in a whole year.\" Sitting atop a folded blanket -- one of the few possessions he carries around -- he said, \"I know it will be difficult to find a job when I come back. There are more people looking for work, and fewer openings. But I'll do whatever I have to -- wherever a small thing can be done, I will do it. I have hope.\" And in the worst-case scenario, Mr. Zhai and his friends say they can always return to their farm, where there is plenty of homegrown food to eat. --- Kersten Zhang, Sue Feng and Andrew Batson contributed to this article.",
        "debiased_text": "BEIJING -- As some 200 million or more Chinese prepare to return home this weekend to celebrate the Lunar New Year, many of them are migrant workers facing potential challenges related to employment and financial stability. The holiday is a time for families to reunite, reflect on the previous year, and make plans for the future. For rural residents, it is also a period when they typically make decisions about future employment opportunities.\n\nAccording to media reports, a significant number of former migrant workers have already returned to their rural hometowns, remaining there for weeks. This is attributed to the closure of factories and the subsequent termination of employees' contracts. In Zhenyang County, central China, for example, 25,000 migrants returned home in December, which represents more than 60% of the local migrant labor force, after losing their factory jobs.\n\nThe situation has affected many families. Cai Qin, a 35-year-old factory worker from a village in Guizhou, a southwestern province, and her husband previously earned combined monthly wages of 2,000 yuan, which allowed them to build a house and support their brother-in-law's high-school education. However, this year they returned home early after their toy factory near Hong Kong closed in November. This year's homecoming has been different, as they did not bring any gifts for their families. Ms. Cai stated that she and her husband are uncertain about their plans after the holidays and expressed concern about the situation.\n\nThis issue has raised concerns regarding potential social stability challenges, as rural residents constitute a large portion of China's population. According to official data, rural incomes have increased sixfold since 1990, with income from off-farm work becoming an increasingly vital component of rural households' earnings. In 2007, 1,596 yuan, or 39% of the per capita annual income of rural households, came from wages, up from 20% in 1990.\n\nDorothy Solinger, a professor at the University of California in Irvine and an expert on China's internal migration, notes that in previous years, despite hardships, migrant workers had opportunities for upward mobility. She suggests that the current situation could be different, as it might lead to a potential decrease in mobility.\n\nIn response to these concerns, the government has initiated measures to assist laid-off migrant workers. In southern Guangdong province, where many manufacturers have closed, the provincial labor bureau introduced regulations in December, requiring local governments to create employment opportunities or provide necessary support to these workers. The bureau also started offering free job services, training, and financial assistance to those looking to start their own businesses.\n\nDespite these challenges, some experts caution against overestimating the likelihood of large-scale unrest. They point to the resilience of Chinese rural residents, along with the existence of informal support networks that help those in need, including assistance from extended families and villagers.\n\nAt Beijing West Railway Station on Wednesday, migrant workers waiting for trains to return home for the Lunar New Year expressed a mix of emotions, with some feeling optimistic despite anticipating difficulties in finding new jobs upon their return. Zhai Yuanhui, a farmer from Peicundian village in Henan province, who has spent three years in Beijing doing odd jobs, mentioned that he expects fewer job opportunities and more competition for work. However, he stated that he有信心 (has confidence) in finding some form of work and remains hopeful. He noted that if necessary, he and his friends can always return to their farms, where they have access to sufficient food supplies."

        "original_text": "The Obama administration devoted the early part of this week to high-level negotiations with China, flooding the \"strategic and economic dialogue\" with dozens of top-level officials who engaged their counterparts from the People's Republic in wide-ranging policy discussions. In fact, it was reminiscent of the full-court press the administration put on congressional Republicans in the early part of the year. The central difference, of course, is that the administration appears to be making progress with the Chinese, or at least finding a fundamental common ground, whereas the Republicans are as fractious as ever. Before conservatives go straight to the \"takes a socialist to know a socialist\" jokes, though, they should reflect on why, exactly, the Chinese are willing to work with the administration. First, the Chinese get macroeconomics. On a phone call with reporters on the first day of the conference, a senior Obama administration official mused that one of the reasons that discussions had been so productive is that the two countries followed similar approaches to the financial crisis and global recession: a fiscal stimulus, loose monetary policy and a willingness to shift broad macroeconomic goals – from borrowing to savings and investment in the US, and from exports to domestic consumer demand in China. That's why the Chinese, for instance, seem to buy the administration's promises of fiscal rectitude. Though they worry about American debt, since they own so much of it, Chinese officials accept the White House's explanation that once the economy begins to recover they will begin implementing policies to tighten inflation and lower the deficit. One Chinese official was particularly effusive in his praise of a speech delivered by Peter Orszag, the director of the White House office of management and budget, on the subject. But it's clear they understand the logic of using government demand to replace lagging private investment until the economy recovers. Meanwhile, Republicans have tried to start bank runs, offered doomsday warnings of stagflation and played Herbert Hoover by urging massive effective budget cuts that would increase the negative effects of the recession. No wonder Obama has had more luck working with the Chinese than with the Republicans. It's not about socialism – in fact, the Obama administration continues to urge the Chinese to liberalise their financial system. It's just accepting the basic principles of macroeconomics. Second, the Chinese get science. The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding at the dialogue, laying out a framework to pursue emissions reductions, invest in low-carbon energy and protect the environment. This is further than the administration has gotten with many Republicans who refuse to believe that global climate change is even real, much less worth doing something about. Which is not to say that this memorandum will result in huge changes. Despite the recognition of the problems of climate change, the Chinese are still concerned about the economic costs of reducing emissions. But they're willing to consider the long-term balance costs and benefits, which is a real start toward concrete decisions to go green. Finally, the Chinese get non-zero sum competition. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, raised a few eyebrows the other day when he argued that the US should maintain its fleet of expensive F-22 fighter planes in order to fight India, a country the US surely counts as a friend. But it was even worse when he corrected his statement, saying he meant to say the fighters were needed in case of conflict with China. But China, of course, is a country the US should engage, not confront. A few days later, Dai Bingguo, one of the two leaders of the Chinese delegation to Washington, told an audience of business and political leaders: \"Don't lose any sleep over China!\" He explained that China did not seek arms races or hegemony, and even historically focused on its own internal development. While it may be wise for the US to be prudent in a relationship with a country whose interests don't always match our own, it's also clear that cooperation is a better path than confrontation. Hence President Obama's remarks on Monday that he also envisions a \"a future where China is a strong, prosperous and successful member of the community of nations. A future when our nations are partners out of necessity, but also out of opportunity.\" Republicans have thus far not demonstrated that they understand the value of engaging countries that can be perceived as threats or alien to US culture, whether with relatively uncontroversial example of China or the hot-button issues of Cuba and Iran. Of course, none of these commonalities means that real progress will be made in the US-China relationship, just as Republican obstruction doesn't mean that there will be no progress on the Obama administration's domestic agenda. But it always helps to start with an interlocutor who you can agree with on basic principles. China may be far away from Obama both geographically and politically, but the Republicans might as well be living on the moon.",
        "debiased_text": "The Obama administration conducted high-level negotiations with China during the early part of this week, bringing together numerous top officials for discussions on a range of policy issues within the 'strategic and economic dialogue' framework. The administration's approach to these negotiations was similar to its earlier interactions with congressional Republicans. However, the administration reported that discussions with China were more productive, as both sides appeared to have found a basis for common ground, whereas interactions with the Republicans remained challenging. A senior Obama administration official mentioned during a press call that one reason for the productive nature of the talks was the shared approaches to addressing the financial crisis and global recession, including fiscal stimulus, loose monetary policy, and adjustments to macroeconomic goals. The Chinese seemed to accept the administration's commitment to fiscal responsibility, although they expressed concerns about American debt levels due to their significant ownership of U.S. debt. A Chinese official praised a speech delivered by Peter Orszag, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, indicating recognition of the logic behind using government demand to support economic recovery. The two countries also signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at reducing emissions, investing in low-carbon energy, and protecting the environment. This agreement suggests a shared interest in addressing climate change, although the Chinese remain cautious about the economic implications of emissions reductions. The administration emphasized that cooperation with China is preferable to confrontation, noting that China does not seek arms races or hegemony and has traditionally prioritized internal development. President Obama stated on Monday that he envisions a future where China is a strong, prosperous, and successful member of the international community and a partner with the U.S. based on both necessity and opportunity. In contrast, Republicans have not demonstrated a clear understanding of the importance of engaging with countries that may be viewed as threats or culturally different, such as China, Cuba, or Iran. While these shared principles do not guarantee progress in U.S.-China relations, they do provide a starting point for agreement. The administration acknowledged that the Republicans' lack of engagement with such countries could be perceived as a significant obstacle."

Southern Weekend confirmed Xiang Xi had been named as \"executive\" editor-in-chief, claiming that it was only a change of title. Three employees told Reuters he had been demoted after pressure from the propaganda authorities. All staff requested anonymity.

According to Reuters, the Chinese foreign ministry approved the meeting, angering propaganda officials . Another editor said the officials restricted questions and slashed material approved for publication, although a White House transcript did not contain extra material. Many early copies of the paper did not contain the interview at all – apparently because printing was delayed by intense last-minute discussions with officials which even included the font size of the headline. The bottom halves of its two pages were almost blank with a brief message: \"It's not every issue we have an exclusive interview, but you can come here every week to understand China.\" It seemed to reflect the Chinese newspaper tradition of \"opening a window to the sky\" – leaving an empty space to show something had been cut. \"Whether that was the intention of the ad, it was certainly read that way,\" said the editor from another publication, who said censors also told the paper not to print a note from Obama which remarked on the importance of a free press. The liberal newspaper is known for its pioneering investigations of social problems and official corruption, although in recent years pressure from the authorities has reined it in. One blogger wrote that he had not bought the newspaper for over a year, feeling its influence had decreased, but now wanted to support it. \"Unexpectedly, this incident [the blank space] made me inspect it again,\" he added.",

        "original_text": "Israel and pro-western Arab states feel that their concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions have been vindicated by the latest dramatic revelations about a secret, second uranium enrichment plant. News about the Qom site will encourage those across the Middle East who want to see tough sanctions imposed and cheer those who fear the prospect of unilateral military action by Israel – the likely outcome if diplomacy fails. But both Israelis and Arabs worry about a deal that will leave Iran as a powerful regional actor. There was no official reaction from Jersualem, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was flying home from New York, where he highlighted the Iranian government's \"extreme fundamentalism\" and \"fanaticism\" in his UN general assembly speech. Arab governments made no official comment, but regional media headlined the news from the G20 summit. Saudi Arabia, Iran's main Arab adversary, has made clear along with its smaller Gulf allies that they will pressure Russia and China to drop their resistance to tougher sanctions. But they fear a deal being done with Tehran at their expense. \"There will be a lot of worried phone calls from Arab to western capitals,\" said Mamoun Fandy of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \"Arabs will be suspicious rather than pleased: this confirms their fears of a package deal being done in which they are the package.\" Ephraim Asculai, of Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies, said: \"Everyone suspected that Iran could have had a secret parallel programme to enrich uranium. Asculai, a former official with Israel's Atomic Energy Commission, noted that the newly-exposed plant near Qom was reportedly smaller than Natanz, Iran's main enrichment plant, and therefore it seemed likely that the only purpose for the second plant was for weapons. Meir Javedanfar, another Israeli analyst, said: \"It is a vindication for Israel and supports its position for the last 10 years that Iran is not being frank and honest in its dealings with the IAEA. If people are going to talk to Iran there will be more room for Israel's assessment of the situation.\" But this should not be used to justify a possible Israeli military strike, Javedanfar warned. Instead, he hoped this new information would convince Iran to accept wider inspections. \"We can use it to our advantage in the negotiations. It's not the time to point fingers but to effectively use this as leverage to force the Iranians to come to some kind of negotiated settlement.\"",
        "debiased_text": "Israel and pro-western Arab states have indicated that their concerns regarding Iran's nuclear activities are supported by recent disclosures about a clandestine, secondary uranium enrichment facility.

Both Israel and Arab states are apprehensive about any agreement that would leave Iran as a dominant regional power.\n\nPrime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was returning from New York, where he delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly addressing Iran's government as having 'extreme fundamentalism' and 'fanaticism.' There was no official statement from Jerusalem regarding the new information.\n\nArab governments did not issue formal reactions, but regional media reported on the news emerging from the G20 summit. Saudi Arabia, which is considered Iran's primary Arab rival, has indicated, along with its Gulf allies, that it will seek to influence Russia and China to reduce their opposition to more stringent sanctions. However, these governments are concerned about a potential agreement being reached with Iran that may not take their interests into account.\n\nMamoun Fandy, from the International Institute for Strategic Studies, stated that there may be increased communication between Arab and Western capitals as a result of this development, with Arab nations being more doubtful than pleased, as it reinforces their concerns about a potential deal that excludes them.\n\nEphraim Asculai, an analyst from Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies and a former official with Israel's Atomic Energy Commission, noted that the newly exposed plant near Qom was reportedly smaller than Natanz, Iran's primary enrichment facility.

He expressed hope that this information could lead to more extensive inspections by Iran, and he emphasized that it should be used as leverage in negotiations rather than as an excuse for military action. Javedanfar recommended that the new data be utilized effectively to promote a negotiated resolution with Iran."

        "original_text": "The Chinese government has ordered a new crackdown on online video and audio content which could result in a tightening of internet censorship and limit the broadcasting of western films and entertainment programmes on the web. In a notice published on its website earlier this week, the State Administration for Radio, Film and Television published a long list of video and audio content which it declared illegal. The statement warned internet companies that they must edit or erase such content. In addition, it said that foreign films, television series, cartoons and other TV programmes could only be broadcast on the internet after the site operator obtains an individual licence for the respective programme. It was unclear whether the move was part of an overall effort to tighten control over the internet or was motivated by an attempt to block a back door for foreign entertainment content into the Chinese market. China has several authorities involved in internet censorship and regulation, but SARFT is not normally one of them. The list of banned video and audio content ordered internet companies to edit or erase video content that \"maliciously damages the image of the People's Liberation Army, the Armed Police, the police or the judiciary, or which relates to the torturing of prisoners and the questioning and torturing of criminal suspects\". This definition follows the blocking of YouTube in China after users uploaded videos to the site that appeared to show a man being tortured to death by security forces in Tibet. The broadcasting regulator also targeted other user-generated content that could have a political dimension. The notice called on internet portals and video sharing service providers to step up their screening efforts and search content for keywords such as \"netizen journalist\", \"mocking\" or \"funny\" and \"creative\". The detailed orders come after a government crackdown on \"vulgar\" internet content triggered a wave of creative songs, cartoons, mock TV shows and poems poking fun at the censors that has lasted for two months and shows no sign of abating. However, the inclusion of foreign film and television content could also point to an attempt to close foreign studios out of the online broadcasting market. Offline, SARFT applies tough restrictions on overseas content, allowing no more than 20 foreign films to be screened in the country's cinemas every year. Many Chinese watch foreign movies on pirated DVDs or through video downloads of pirated online versions instead.

The riots are believed to stem from a toy-factory incident in China's southern Guangdong province, where managers imported hundreds of Uighur workers at lower wages than the previous, ethnic-Han Chinese work force. \"It's a bit of a wake-up call for management that they can't just take these shortcuts,\" said Geoffrey Crothall, one of the authors of the study. The group attributed part of the surge in disputes to China's new labor law, which took effect last year and promises workers collective-bargaining rights. Although many of the provisions have been flouted, it has increased worker consciousness, said Li Qiang, a New York-based labor expert. \"There has been a lot of publicity about the new law,\" Mr. Li said. \"Many workers didn't understand their rights beforehand.\" Another reason for the upsurge, according to the study, is that workers don't have effective grievance procedures. \"You need a credible trade union in the workplace to represent concerns and grievances,\" Mr. Crothall said, adding, \"currently, conditions are dictated by management, and workers' only option is to protest.\" During China's boom years, workers could easily quit and find another job, but now this is rarely an option.",
        "debiased_text": "BEIJING -- A labor-rights group has reported an increase in labor disputes in China over the past year, citing workers organizing protests to seek improved working conditions. The Hong Kong-based China Labour Bulletin noted that the number of protests rose to approximately 127,000 in the past year, compared to 87,000 in 2005, the last year for which official government statistics were released. This figure is based on published reports. According to the study, the number of labor arbitration cases also increased to 693,000 last year, up from 350,000 in 2007, as reported by government data. The recent unrest in China's northwestern Xinjiang region was linked to a toy-factory incident in the southern Guangdong province, where managers reportedly hired Uighur workers at lower wages than the previously employed ethnic-Han Chinese workforce. Geoffrey Crothall, one of the study's authors, stated that the situation serves as a reminder that employers cannot continue to use such practices. The study suggests that the new labor law, which became effective last year and offers workers collective-bargaining rights, has contributed to the increase in disputes. While many provisions of the law have not been fully implemented, it has raised awareness among workers about their rights, according to Li Qiang, a labor expert based in New York. The study also identified a lack of effective grievance procedures as a contributing factor. Mr. Crothall emphasized the importance of having a credible trade union in the workplace to address worker concerns, noting that currently, working conditions are largely influenced by management, leaving workers with limited options other than protest. In previous years of economic growth, workers had the ability to leave their jobs and find new employment, but this is no longer a common option."

        "original_text": "WASHINGTON -- The Chinese government is ratcheting up its cyberspying operations against the U.S., a congressional advisory panel found, citing an example of a carefully orchestrated campaign against one U.S. company that appears to have been sponsored by Beijing. The unnamed company was just one of several successfully penetrated by a campaign of cyberespionage, according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission report to be released Thursday. Chinese espionage operations are \"straining the U.S. capacity to respond,\" the report concludes. The bipartisan commission, formed by Congress in 2000 to investigate the security implications of growing trade with China, is made up largely of former U.S. government officials in the national security field. The commission contracted analysts at defense giant Northrop Grumman Corp. to write the report. The analysts wouldn't name the company described in the case study, describing it only as \"a firm involved in high-technology development.\" The report didn't provide a damage assessment and didn't say specifically who was behind the attack against the U.S. company. But it said the company's internal analysis indicated the attack originated in or came through China. The report concluded the attack was likely supported, if not orchestrated, by the Chinese government, because of the \"professional quality\" of the operation and the technical nature of the stolen information, which is not easily sold by rival companies or criminal groups. The operation also targeted specific data and processed \"extremely large volumes\" of stolen information, the report said. \"The case study is absolutely clearly controlled and directed with a specific purpose to get at defense technology in a related group of companies,\" said Larry Wortzel, vice chairman of the commission and a former U.S. Army attache in China. \"There's no doubt that that's state-controlled.\" Attacks like that cited in the report hew closely to a blueprint frequently used by Chinese cyberspies, who in total steal $40 billion to $50 billion in intellectual property from U.S. organizations each year, according to U.S. intelligence agency estimates provided by a person familiar with them. \"Modern-day espionage doesn't involve cloak and dagger anymore,\" said Tom Kellermann, a vice president at Core Security Technologies, a cybersecurity company. \"It's all electronic.\" China is among more than 100 countries that have the capability to conduct cyberspying operations. The bulk of the report describes the growing ambitions of the Chinese military in cyberspace and its efforts to develop the capability to destroy adversary networks with physical and cyberattacks in the event of a crisis. Wang Baodong, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, criticized the commission as \"a product of Cold War mentality\" that was \"put in place to pick China to pieces.\" He added: \"Accusations of China conducting, or 'likely conducting' as the commission's report indicates, cyberspace attacks or espionage against the U.S. are unfounded and unwarranted.\" In the highly organized cyberspy scheme that drained valuable research and development information from a U.S. company, the report said, the hackers \"operated at times using a communication channel between a host with an [Internet] address located in the People's Republic of China and a server on the company's internal network.\" In the months leading up to the 2007 operation, cyberspies did extensive reconnaissance, identifying which employee computer accounts they wanted to hijack and which files they wanted to steal. They obtained credentials for dozens of employee accounts, which they accessed nearly 150 times. The cyberspies then reached into the company's networks using the same type of program help-desk administrators use to remotely access computers. The hackers copied and transferred files to seven servers hosting the company's email system, which were capable of processing large amounts of data quickly. Once they moved the data to the email servers, the intruders renamed the stolen files to blend in with the other files on the system and compressed and encrypted the files for export. Before exporting the data, the collection team used employee accounts to take over four desktop computers to direct the final stage of the operation. They selected at least eight U.S. computers outside the company, including two at unidentified universities, as a drop point for the stolen data before sending it overseas. The high Internet traffic volume on university networks provides excellent cover. The spies activated the operation on all seven servers almost simultaneously, which suggested a plan to export the data as quickly as possible. The company's computer-security team eventually detected the outflow of data, but \"not before significant amounts of the company's data left the network,\" according to the report. The report highlights several departments of China's military, the People's Liberation Army, responsible for components of cyberspying. Together these divisions oversee electronic spying and attack efforts, as well as research and development. The PLA has also been creating a number of cyberwarfare militia units, which draw on civilians in the telecommunications and technology sectors, as well as academia, the report found.",

In its analysis, the report described how the hackers used a communication channel between a host located in China and a server on the company's internal network. Prior to the 2007 operation, extensive reconnaissance was conducted to identify employee computer accounts and specific files to target. Credentials for multiple employee accounts were obtained and used in nearly 150 access attempts.

        "original_text": "The Chinese air force claimed today that the biggest weather modification operation in the country's history cleared the skies over Tiananmen Square just in time for the National Day parade. I write this post under gorgeously azure skies. Instead of the dull haze I have grown used to in Beijing over the past few years, the light is so sharp that it almost hurts my eyes. The transformation is so dramatic it is eerie. When I flew into Beijing yesterday, the city was shrouded in what looked like a thick smog. Weather forecasters said it would rain around midnight and, hey presto, the first drops of rain started to fall almost on the dot. Even so, when I left the house at 4am this morning, it was still so gloomy that my taxi driver slowed the car because visibility was poor. \"Wuran\" (pollution), he explained. But was it? By 5.30am, when I arrived at the media centre for the National Day parade, the skies had cleared sufficiently to be able to see a star. But there were still thick clusters of cloud and some mist. It might rain again, I thought. We were bussed to the press gallery outside the Forbidden City by about 7.20am. A band of cumulus lingered over the Great Hall of the People. They had darkened when I called a friend an hour later. Just before I rang off, I described the skies to him. \"It might still rain on the parade, but I think the odds are now on their [the organisers'] side,\" I said. Once the march started, I concentrated on that, but I recall being impressed by the unusual vividness of the sky on some of the images on the giant screens. Other colleagues told me they found it remarkable that the clouds seemed almost to be held back from the square, even though there were still some around the edges. By the time of the fly-past around 11am, the skies were clear until air force jets left behind lines of coloured smoke-trails. Now, six hours later, Beijing is still enjoying perfect conditions. What happened? According to Chinese Meterology News, there were four attacks on a bank of clouds that approached Tiananmen from the south-west between 7.30am and 9.05am. In total 432 rockets were fired to achieve the desired result. Xinhua news agency reports that the authorities also had the capacity to delay rainfall. \"Only a handful countries in the world could organise such large-scale magic-like weather modification,\" it quoted Cui Lianqing, a senior air force meteorologist as saying. But cloud seeding is generally considered far too imprecise a technique to guarantee the results seen today, which begs several questions. If clearing the skies is this easy, why don't the authorities do it all the time? Is it the cost? Concern about over-use of chemicals? Or were the authorities just lucky today?",
        "debiased_text": "The Chinese air force reported today that a significant weather modification operation was conducted to clear the skies over Tiananmen Square in preparation for the National Day parade. Observers noted a dramatic change in the weather conditions, with skies becoming clearer by the morning of the event. Earlier reports indicated that rain was expected around midnight, and precipitation began shortly thereafter. However, by 4 a.m., visibility remained poor, with the taxi driver attributing this to pollution. By 5:30 a.m., the skies had sufficiently cleared to allow visibility of a star, though thick clouds and mist were still present. At 7:20 a.m., attendees were transported to the press gallery outside the Forbidden City, where cumulus clouds remained over the Great Hall of the People. By 11 a.m., during the fly-past, the skies were clear, except for the colored smoke trails left by the air force jets. According to Chinese Meteorology News, four operations were carried out between 7:30 a.m. and 9:05 a.m., involving the firing of 432 rockets to modify the weather. Xinhua News Agency cited a senior air force meteorologist, Cui Lianqing, stating that only a few countries have the capability to organize such large-scale weather modification efforts. Questions remain regarding the frequency of such operations, including potential factors such as cost, concerns over chemical overuse, or whether the current conditions were the result of luck."

        "original_text": "Global trade tensions ratcheted up yesterday as the US opened an investigation into Chinese steel imports and clashed with the European Union over chickens. The US steel pipe investigation is likely to irritate Beijing, which last month accused its biggest trading partner of \"rampant protectionism\" after President Barack Obama imposed a heavy duty on imported Chinese tyres. That decision rattled many economists, who feared that Mr Obama would backtrack on his free trade promises in an attempt to pacify the politically important US unions. Resentment towards China has been growing in the US as the recession pummels manufacturers. The latest investigation into seamless steel pipes is one of a string that has been opened this year. A petition, filed by several steel companies and the United Steelworkers union, said unfairly low Chinese prices spurred a 218 per cent surge in imports last year to $328m (EUR222m, pound(s)206m). The petition asks for a 98.37 per cent anti-dumping duty as well as countervailing duties aimed at offsetting what it said were Chinese government subsidies. Beijing, which was on National Day holiday yesterday, has not reacted to the announcement. Such investigations are common and do not necessarily turn into tariffs but the move is likely to exacerbate China's fears that US companies have been encouraged by the tyres case to ask for more protection. China has become a clear target amid the global downturn, and not just for US companies.

This action has been of concern to some economists who worried about potential deviations from Obama's commitment to free trade, aimed at addressing concerns from politically significant US unions.

Another potential issue between the US and China is scheduled for next week, when the US Treasury will determine if Beijing is manipulating its currency.

        "original_text": "SHANGHAI -- China's banking regulator, in an apparent move to ease concerns over tougher capital requirements for banks, said a plan to stop banks from counting cross-held subordinated debt as part of their capital will be implemented only gradually. The regulator's comments are the latest sign of Beijing's unease with the stock market's recent slump, which was triggered in part by worries the rules could force banks to cut back lending or issue new shares to meet capital-adequacy ratios. The China Banking Regulatory Commission said in a statement late Thursday that it plans to allow banks to implement the proposed rule on an annual basis, letting them remove such holdings from their books over a year rather than as a one-off deduction. It didn't elaborate. The proposed rule, which was first mentioned by the regulator in an internal directive last month, is part of a campaign to prevent systemic risks arising from an unprecedented credit boom in the first half of the year that was spurred by Beijing's push to jump-start the economy. \"A gradual approach will offer banks a grace period to unload their cross-holdings of subdebt and reduce lenders' need to raise funds in the near term,\" said Jin Lin, an Orient Securities analyst. Talk of tougher bank capital rules and a marked slowdown in new loans in the past two months rocked China's stock market, leading to a 22% decline in the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index in August. Concerns that domestic banks would be in a rush to raise funds from the stock market to meet stricter capital requirements contributed to the drop.

        "title": "Cultural revolution: By 2050 China will pervade every aspect of life across the globe. By David Pilling; Cultural revolution:   By 2050 China will pervade every aspect of life across the globe. By David Pilling",
        "original_text": "Books about China ruling the world used to be prefaced by \"if\". Now, more often, they are preceded by the assumptive \"when\". Such is the age we live in. Martin Jacques' 550-pager on the ascent of China finds little space to consider the question of whether its rapid economic progress is unstoppable. It ignores almost entirely the other popular - and perfectly plausible - premise for books on the Middle Kingdom: \"When China's miracle goes phut\". Jacques' book is based on the extrapolation that, by 2050, China will be the biggest economy in the world, surpassing the US and India which, by then, will be third. By virtue of what Jacques calls the \"merciless measure\" of gross domestic product, China will be politically and militarily the most powerful country in the world. We might argue about these two central premises, namely that China's GDP will inevitably surpass that of the US, and that there is an almost mechanical relationship between economic output and power. These are legitimate points of debate for other books. Yet Jacques can be forgiven for making this leap of faith and asking what will happen to the world if, indeed, China becomes a dominant power. Jacques' thesis - argued clearly and logically, if somewhat laboriously - is that China's rise will overturn \"western\" assumptions about what it is to be modern. To date, the world's only successful economies of any size - with the exception of Japan - have been European or, in the case of the US, of European pedigree. The knee-jerk assumption of globalisation, he argues, is that as countries modernise they take on western characteristics.\"We are so used to the world being western, even American, that we have little idea what it would be like if it was not,\" he writes. Jacques contends, not unreasonably, that China's continental size, huge population, racial homogeneity and confidence in the centrality of its own civilisation make for a country capable of redefining what it is to be modern. If Britain was a maritime hegemon and the US an airborne and economic one, then China will be a cultural one, he predicts. As Chinese confidence grows apace with its decisive emergence from two centuries of humiliation, its overriding attitude will not be one of catching up with the west, but rather of regaining its rightful place as the world's pre-eminent civilisation. \"As the dominant global power, China is likely to have a strongly hierarchical view of the world, based on a combination of racial and cultural attitudes,\" he writes. China will draw on its Confucian roots, a paternalistic ethos that, he argues, is not readily compatible with western democratic principles. He goes so far as to suggest that it would be best for China, indeed the world, if the \"present regime continues\" for some time, a verdict that this former editor of Marxism Today might not have advanced, say, about the Chile of Augusto Pinochet. Much of the future Jacques foresees for China can be found in its past. He expects it to reassert elements of its ancient tributary relationship with neighbouring countries, leaving them alone so long as they pay cultural obeisance. China's idea of itself as a living civilisation - what he calls a \"civilization-state\" as opposed to a nation-state - means it will never yield to assaults on its unity, particularly when it comes to Taiwan. Jacques' overriding point is that, in future, \"the debate over values will be rooted in culture rather than ideology, since the underlying values of a society are primarily the outcome of distinctive histories and cultures\". His contention is that, since China's culture and history are so formidable, it will not bend to western norms. If there is any bending to be done, it is the west that must yield. That makes the book a useful corrective to those who assume that emerging superpowers, principal among them China, will recreate themselves in America's image. Yet Jacques puts too much faith in culture as the ultimate arbiter of a nation's destiny. He dismisses the argument of Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, that the divide between east and west is more a question of time lag than intrinsic cultural difference. But in doing so, he goes too far the other way. He overemphasises Asia's cultural predilections for community over individual, for social relationships over law, and for stability over freedom. In both south-east and north-east Asian culture, he writes, \"the individual finds affirmation and recognition not in their own individual identity but in being part of a group\". These are sweeping statements that, at worst, sound like a Singaporean advertisement for Asian values. Jacques' writing on racism is revealing. Contrasting China with multicultural America, he presents it as an inherently racist culture more or less incapable of summoning a multicultural view of the world. \"The fact that the Chinese regard themselves as superior to the rest of the human race, and that this belief has a racial component, will confront the rest of the world with a serious problem,\" he writes. In what he describes as the \"Middle Kingdom mentality\", he presents China as uniquely conflicted in its simultaneous feeling of superiority to other cultures and its inferiority to westerners who have overtaken it. These conflicted attitudes, for example, are common, and describe feelings of frustration and national inheritance denied (or at least postponed) in countries as far apart as Argentina and Japan. In China's rise, Jacques tends to see menace, albeit of a cultural rather than a militaristic nature. China's view of itself as the centre of civilisation will, he says, lead to a \"profound cultural and racial reordering of the world in the Chinese image\". But Jacques is more on the right lines when, elsewhere in the book, he talks about competing modernities. If, as he expects, China emerges as a world power to challenge the US, then modernisation is likely to be a two-way street, even a multi-lane highway, on which different versions circulate of what it means to be modern. In the future, Americans may indeed watch more Chinese films and study Mandarin. But, by the same token, the Chinese will continue to learn from the west as its wholesale import of western capital, business practice and technology demonstrates. Just as Europeans and Americans may read more Confucius, so the Chinese will study more Shakespeare. It sounds like fun. The world is more likely to become multi-polar and culturally layered than recreated in China's image. That is the whole point: China will not rule the world. David Pilling is the managing editor of the FT's Asia edition",
        "debiased_text": "Books about China's potential global influence used to begin with the conditional 'if.' Now, they are more frequently prefaced by the assumption 'when.' This reflects a shift in discourse around the country's future role in global affairs. Martin Jacques' book, which spans 550 pages, examines China's rise as a global power without extensively addressing whether its rapid economic growth is sustainable. It largely omits the popular viewpoint that China's economic success may not last indefinitely, often summarized as 'when China's miracle goes phut.' Jacques' argument is based on the projection that by 2050, China's economy will surpass that of the United States and India, thereby becoming the largest globally. He asserts that, through the metric of gross domestic product, China will also achieve the greatest political and military influence. These premises may be contested in other works, but Jacques' focus is on exploring the implications if China does become a dominant power. Jacques suggests that China's emergence will challenge Western concepts of modernity, which have historically been associated with European or American economic models. He argues that as countries modernize, they often adopt Western traits, but this might not apply to China due to its size, population, cultural homogeneity, and confidence in its own civilization. Jacques predicts that China's future influence will be cultural rather than purely economic or military, akin to how Britain was a maritime power and the US an airborne and economic one. As China reclaims its status as a leading global civilization, he suggests, it may adopt a more hierarchical perspective based on racial and cultural considerations. Drawing on historical tributary relationships with its neighbors, Jacques expects China to seek recognition and respect from other nations, with a particular emphasis on maintaining unity, especially regarding Taiwan. Jacques' thesis centers on the idea that future global discussions about values will be influenced more by culture than ideology, as societies develop based on their unique histories and customs. He argues that because of China's strong and distinctive cultural identity, it will not conform to Western norms, and any adaptation would likely require the West to adjust. However, this cultural emphasis may be overstated. Jacques challenges the argument made by Chris Patten, the former British governor of Hong Kong, that the East-West divide is more a matter of timing than inherent cultural differences. Critics might argue that Jacques does not sufficiently examine other factors, such as the east's broader social and economic integration with Western practices. His treatment of race and cultural diversity is descriptive, contrasting China's homogeneity with America's multiculturalism. He posits that China's self-perception of superiority may pose challenges for the rest of the world. This 'Middle Kingdom' mentality, Jacques suggests, may include a unique combination of feelings of cultural pride and historical inferiority. Such views are not unique to China and can be found in various nations facing similar situations. Jacques interprets China's rise more as a cultural challenge than a direct threat. He envisions a future in which different models of modernity coexist, with China's ascendancy not necessarily resulting in a monolithic global influence. He believes that mutual cultural exchange may be the more probable outcome, with Americans engaging with Chinese culture while the Chinese continue to learn from the West. This perspective implies a more diverse and layered future for global cultural interactions. Ultimately, the world is unlikely to be entirely reshaped according to China's image, but rather多元化 and multipolar in nature.

        "title": "China's Uighur conundrum | John Gittings",
        "original_text": "Until now, it has been Beijing that talked up the threat of ethnic separatism in its far north-west region of Xinjiang, while the attitude of most of the Muslim Uighur population has been one of quiet – though unhappy – acceptance of Chinese rule. But the latest outbreak of violence in the regional capital of Urumqi is unprecedented and suggests that Uighur resentment at heavy-handed Chinese policies has begun to boil over. For Uighurs to challenge the authorities in what has become a largely Chinese city is even more remarkable. Xinjiang shares with Tibet a history of only intermittent control from Beijing and the misfortune of being seen by the Chinese as a strategic buffer region against its neighbours. There were two short-lived independent \"East Turkestan\" republics in the 1930s and 1940s – the second under strong Soviet influence. After the 1949 Chinese communist victory, Beijing quickly moved thousands of soldiers to set up paramilitary state farms: Xinjiang became a favoured location for penal centres, and later on for Red Guards who were \"sent down to the countryside\". After subsequent waves of migration, Han Chinese now make up 40% of the population, not much less than the 47% of Uighurs. I vividly remember a school playground in Urumqi that I visited in 1978, two years after the Cultural Revolution, where all the Han Chinese played on one side of the yard, and all the Uighurs on the other. The kids were taught in separate classes, and in separate languages. Today, according to a report from Save the Children (pdf), the situation is even worse. It is increasingly difficult for Uighur children to learn their own mother tongue at school; since 2005, Mandarin or \"standard\" Chinese has become the official language of instruction. As in Tibet, younger Uighurs hoped to benefit from Chinese economic reforms but became alienated as the major profits went to Han Chinese migrants. University graduates complain that they suffer from job discrimination, while in the rural areas farmers complain that water and other resources are diverted to Chinese settlers. Many Uighurs believe that, as the latest Amnesty briefing puts it, their ethnic identity is being \"systematically eroded\". There have been some violent incidents on a smaller scale since the late 1990s, with isolated bombing and riots: Beijing's response, again as in Tibet, has been to step up repression – including hundreds of executions – in a campaign against the alleged \"three evils\" (terrorism, separatism and religious extremism). Especially since September 11, Beijing has made the most of the alleged \"terrorist threat\" in Xinjiang, partly to show the US that China was on board for the war on terror, and also to justify a general crackdown. According to official Chinese media nearly 1,300 people were arrested last year on \"three evils\" charges. China's demonisation of Uighur dissent has been described by Professor Dru Gladney (an expert on Islam in China) as a case of \"scapegoat terrorism\". The core issue – once more as in Tibet – is not so much that the Uighurs want independence. Most say that they are resigned to the reality of Chinese sovereignty, and at best seek a measure of genuine autonomy (Xinjiang is officially an \"Autonomous Region\" though this means even less than in Tibet). Yet the scenes of Uighur-on-Han violence from Urumqi – allowing for the selective use of images by the Chinese media – suggest that, on the Uighur street, the build-up of ethnic resentment has reached a new and more serious stage. The threat that China half invented may be coming closer to reality. Two weeks ago Xi Jinping (the rising Communist party star who may one day succeed President Hu Jintao), paid a significant though barely reported visit to Xinjiang. He insisted that the local party should appoint officials who could do a better job of handling ethnic relations. He warned that they should solve the \"real difficulties\" that Uighurs suffer in housing, food, health, education and employment. It is an important admission, but it should have been made long before.",
        "debiased_text": "Until now, Beijing has emphasized the threat of ethnic separatism in its far north-west region of Xinjiang, while the Muslim Uighur population has generally accepted Chinese rule quietly. The latest outbreak of violence in the regional capital, Urumqi, has been described as unprecedented. This event suggests that Uighur resentment toward certain Chinese policies may have intensified. It is notable that the Uighurs are challenging the authorities in a city that has become predominantly Chinese. Xinjiang, like Tibet, has a history of sporadic control from Beijing and is viewed by the Chinese government as a strategic buffer against neighboring regions. There were two short-lived independent 'East Turkestan' republics during the 1930s and 1940s, the latter influenced by the Soviet Union. After the 1949 Chinese communist victory, Beijing deployed thousands of soldiers to establish paramilitary state farms in Xinjiang. The region became a site for penal centers and later for Red Guards who were sent to live in the countryside. Over time, Han Chinese migration increased, and they now make up approximately 40% of the population, close to the 47% of Uighurs. In 1978, two years after the Cultural Revolution, a school playground in Urumqi was observed where Han Chinese and Uighur children played separately. They were taught in different classes and different languages. According to a report from Save the Children, it is increasingly difficult for Uighur children to learn their own mother tongue in school. Since 2005, Mandarin or 'standard' Chinese has become the official language of instruction. Similar to Tibet, younger Uighurs initially hoped to benefit from Chinese economic reforms but have become alienated as the profits primarily benefited Han Chinese migrants. University graduates report job discrimination, and in rural areas, farmers complain about resources being diverted to Chinese settlers. Many Uighurs believe their ethnic identity is being systematically eroded, as noted in an Amnesty International briefing. Since the late 1990s, there have been several smaller-scale violent incidents, including bombings and riots. Beijing's response has generally been to increase repression, including numerous executions, in a campaign against alleged 'three evils' (terrorism, separatism, and religious extremism). Especially after September 11, 2001, the Chinese government has highlighted the alleged 'terrorist threat' in Xinjiang, partly to demonstrate cooperation with the United States in the war on terror and to justify broader law enforcement measures. According to official Chinese media, nearly 1,300 people were arrested last year on charges related to these 'three evils.' China's portrayal of Uighur dissent as terrorism has been criticized by some experts, such as Professor Dru Gladney, who refer to this as 'scapegoat terrorism.' The primary issue, much like in Tibet, is not necessarily Uighur aspirations for independence. Most Uighurs accept Chinese sovereignty, though some seek a degree of genuine autonomy. The region is officially designated an 'Autonomous Region,' but this status provides limited self-governance. Recent events in Urumqi, acknowledging the potential selective reporting by Chinese media, suggest a new stage in the accumulation of ethnic resentment. The threat that China has partially emphasized may be becoming more significant. Two weeks ago, Xi Jinping, a prominent figure within the Chinese Communist Party, visited Xinjiang. His visit, which received limited media attention, included a call for local officials to improve their handling of ethnic relations. He emphasized the need to address the 'real difficulties' faced by Uighurs in areas such as housing, food, health, education, and employment. This statement represents an important recognition, albeit one that was delayed."

        "original_text": "Is the Asian Century Upon Us? The fundamental reason for the resilience shown during the current economic downturn by nations like India and China is their disciplined approach to saving, investment and spending habits (\"Asia Rising,\" March 30). Need-based buying rather than stark consumerism is the hallmark of the booming Indian middle class, which is still spending around 60 percent of the GDP. The Indian economy is not insulated from global trends, but better regulation and wise management have stood it in good stead in trying times. During about two and a half decades of Indian liberalization and reform processes, we have had our share of policy failures and crisis created by stock market swindlers and scamsters, yet economic development proceeded at a brisk pace. There was some concern when one of the best private sector banks in India came under a cloud of subprime exposure soon after the bubble burst in the United States. However, it emerged from the crisis because of sound financial backup ensured by the regulatory system. It is true that when exports fall our domestic consumption levels go up in order to prop up production. While adopting various fiscal measures and laying stress on infrastructural growth will boost domestic consumption, Asian nations can't do without exports. The solution lies in creating more liberal conditions for exports in order to seize opportunities when the trends start reversing. R. K. Sudan Jammu, India Countries such as India and China are floating in the waters of recession while the West is sinking because the Asian countries have traditionally saved money for the proverbial rainy day. People in the West have simply afforded unwanted luxuries on borrowed money and are today mired in monetary misery. K. Chidanand Kumar Bangalore, India Premier Wen Jiabao has expressed in powerful language his unreserved concern over the fate of Chinese assets in the United States. The West should not be unduly concerned by such unprecedented assertion. As human history attests, good fortune does not favor all people all of the time. Fortune tends to rotate its favoritism; different people at different times. Perhaps it is China's turn to flex its muscle and call the shots in this century. This shouldn't be alarming, as it follows the golden rule of nature, the way of Tao. T. B. Tee and Munti Dann Penang, Malaysia Outraged and Railing Michael Kazin's \"Don't Let The 'Big Men' Win,\" March 30) is a comfortable read about the most uncomfortable crisis of our time: a time when populism is treated by many as a dirty word. To those who say \"This is just because of AIG,\" I say, \"It's not about AIG!\" As Kazin points out, it's about way more than AIG. The rage is a volcano that did not develop and erupt overnight. It's part of a pattern of excess, overindulgence and corruption going back to Enron. The expedient thing to do now is not only to manage the books, but to manage public sentiment. And for this we must demand responsibility from the media. Today, the blogosphere dwarfs TV, radio and periodicals for good or for ill. I'm in a country where doctors, lawyers and CEOs don't usually flaunt megahouses or treasure chests. I ask, why not? Most people say, with a giggle of discomfort, \"Because that would be embarrassing.\" I remember a time when we Americans would say that. Kathleen T. Scott Amsterdam, Netherlands Robert J. Samuelson, in quoting economist Joseph Schumpeter, mentions the two basic capitalist values necessary for economic success: self-enrichment and taking risks (\"Rage Could End Up Hurting Us,\" March 30). CEOs and entrepreneurs are driven by the former. Whereas capitalism originally meant taking personal risk, nowadays it means taking risks for somebody else (savers, investors, mortgage-takers). As long as CEOs can hope for bonuses and as long as running a company into ruin is rewarded with a golden handshake, capitalism will not be able to raise the wealth for society that it otherwise could. Thomas Heusser Schorndorf, Germany Eliot Spitzer's principled guide to the intersection between government and the market (\"Making Up for Years of Neglect,\" March 30) and his recent CNN television interview with NEWSWEEK's Fareed Zakaria make it evident that he's a fine thinker who would be an asset to President Barack Obama's assembly of problem solvers. We, Asians, on the other side of the cultural divide, have always found it quaint, amusing even, that the country with arguably one of the world's largest sex industries pillories otherwise quite brilliant managers for their sexual peccadilloes. I hope that other very American trait, to forgive and forget, will kick in soon and permit Eliot Spitzer to return where he belongs-to a responsible role in government. Stanley Pinto Bangalore, India So, according to Evan Thomas and John Barry, ethics are now \"The Enemy of the Good\" (March 30). They are not-even if evading taxes is so common among politicians that administration jobs go unfilled on Capitol Hill. Thomas and Barry seem to feel that owing $140,000 in back taxes is a mere trifle, but for most of us that's a lot of money. I applaud President Obama for his commitment to clean hands at the top. America also used to be famous for its social conscience. I've been transplanted to Scandinavia, where we can really talk about oppressive taxes. My acquaintances back home in Arizona tend to shake their heads in disbelief, both at our taxes, but also about the fact that universities are free, and that there's good universal health care. Obama wants to improve American health care and education. Is anyone actually opposed to these goals? The high-rolling tax evaders are insured and have been to good schools. Are they really the best and the brightest? Raising taxes to a level still far below Scandinavia's is the obvious way to implement the new administration's realistic and needed goals, and it doesn't hurt anywhere near as much as untreated illness, or cost as much as ignorance. It is not the typical American way, but Barack Obama is not a typical man to show the way. Frances Fischer Svendborg, Denmark Brazil's Economic Success Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's comments have a special economic significance for some developing countries in the Southeast Asian region (\" 'Brazil Has to Be Bold',\" March 30). Most of the small economies fighting large budget deficits and foreign debt have suffered from the global economic downturn. Lula admirably carries the flag of Brazil's recovery and is becoming an exemplar the world over. He rightfully takes a cue from President Barack Obama who is rebuilding America's image. Brazil's leader is also succeeding in alleviating poverty, export promotion, debt reduction, etc., and is looking forward to a positive year-end growth rate; hence his domestic popularity and overwhelming approval rating of 84 percent. While Lula admits that Brazil's development of its infrastructure is still trailing, I would have liked him to express Brazil's development imperatives and strategies moving forward. Lionel Gulawita Kalutara, Sri Lanka As Saudi Arabia Looks to the Future As a Saudi citizen, I was heartened by the fact that NEWSWEEK concluded what many of us in the Kingdom have been experiencing in the past few years: King Abdullah's reform process is vital, serious and well paced within the Saudi context (\"The Monarch Who Declared His Own Revolution,\" March 30). However, the imbalance in your article is quite apparent when one notices the demeaning manner in which you refer to one of this country's most accomplished men \"the Interior minister Prince Naif.\" What is even more painful is the utter failure to mention that with the blessing and encouragement of his brother King Abdullah, he was the mastermind behind what you termed the \"Aggressive efforts by the Saudi security forces 'that' led to the death or capture of most Al Qaeda leaders and operatives.\" Even more painful is your failure to mention that he is the man directly responsible for what former CIA chief Michael Hayden has aptly described as \"the world's most effective counter-radicalization programs.\" Your reference to King Abdullah's attitude toward his fellow Arab leaders is both insensitive and imprecise. Everyone who has dealt with King Abdullah knows all too well how respectful he is even toward those with whom he differs. His belief in the \"simple Arab and Islamic values\" as you have correctly stated shields him from having such a negative attitude. I am afraid that King Abdullah's frank and open style is sometimes misunderstood even by people who should know better. We need to understand others, and listening to or quoting the spinners does not serve this quest. Khalid Alsaeed Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Christopher Dickey's fascinating article on King Abdullah's approach toÂ circumventing or eliminating the stringent rules prescribed by the Wahhabi elements of state,Â which suppress women's rights, is reminiscent of King Faisal's actions prior to his assassination in 1975. I was employed by the Saudi government as clinical laboratory director of the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Riyahd during this period.Â As part of my responsibilities I spent the early morning hours checking out the computer system that controlled our analytical instrumentation.Â Early on, I would see this distinguished gentleman walkingÂ among the computers, located below ground level, fingering his prayer beads and praying. I soon learned it was His Majesty King Faisal and, in time, developed the courage to say \"Good morning, Your Majesty.\" After another week or two King Faisal asked me my name and what I was doing.Â Still later, we conversed withÂ one anotherÂ on a regular basis.Â I vividly recall during one of our conversations him telling me that he realized the Kingdom must commence removing the restrictions on the rights of women otherwise there would be a revolution and, if there was to be a revolution, he wanted it to start in the Royal Palace. Unfortunately, six weeks later he was dead. I am convinced ifÂ King Faisal had lived and continued to carry out his agenda, Saudi Arabia would be far different than it is today. Otto W. Wendel Young Harris, Georgia The Saudi Peace Plan, Revisited It has been some time since I have read a more biased column than the one written by Saudi academic Abdul Rahman H. Al-Saeed (\"Revive the Saudi Peace Plan,\" Feb. 16). First of all, the Saudi peace plan is a recipe for disaster for the Israelis who under its envisaged terms are expected to withdraw to pre-1967 borders, agree to the establishment of a Palestinian state and the return of Palestinian refugees. On top of it all, Israel is expected to recognize Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital. In exchange for these huge and concrete concessions, the Israelis get a \"normalization of Arab-Israeli relations in the context of a comprehensive peace.\" Such a plan would not allow Israel to peacefully coexist with its Arab neighbors but would be an unconditional surrender. For more than 60 years the Arabs have tried to wipe Israel off the face of the earth. Every neutral observer would understand Israel's being somewhat skeptical of Arab offers of peace. I notice that the article is filled with indignant condemnation of Israel's actions in Gaza and the blame for the unfortunate carnage, material loss and human suffering Al-Saeed lays squarely at Israel's door. At no point does he mention the fact that Hamas was the original aggressor by firing rockets into Israeli territory and then hiding behind innocent civilians to avoid retribution. Al-Saeed even has the gall to demand compensation and an apology from Israel. Israel has a right to exist and to protect its citizens by whatever means from the actions of militant Islamic terrorist organizations that still refuse to acknowledge Israel's right to exist. Al-Saeed calls the actions of the Israelis \"disproportionate\" and an \"atrocity.\" The Israelis employed massive force for the dual purpose of communicating to Hamas that Israel means business and of convincing the manipulated local population of Gaza that support for terrorists is counterproductive to their welfare. Israel is as anxious for peace as anybody but not at the price of self-destruction as called for by Arab initiatives such as the Saudi Peace Plan. Israel cannot and should not negotiate on issues absolutely vital to its survival while radical Arab neighbors plot its destruction. Peter Perkins Randburg, South Africa The U.S.--Britain Relationship Stryker McGuire misses the point of the Anglo-American \"special relationship\" between Britain and the United States (\"An Island, Lost At Sea,\" Feb. 23). It is not about whether it is or isn't \"almost entirely foreign to American ears.\" It is about four areas of joint trust and mutual respect: military, intelligence, diplomatic and nuclear. Over the past four years according to the recently departed American ambassador to the Court of St. James's, Robert Tuttle, some 12,000 American politicians and civil servants came to Britain to meet with their counterparts here. Recently on British television an expert was explaining that the accidental collision between the British and French nuclear submarines came about because each didn't know the other was in the area. He observed that only the United States and Britain keep each other informed about the whereabouts of their nuclear defense subs, describing it as a very deep secret, not generally shared even with other NATO allies. It isn't time to \"move on\" from the special relationship, but it is past time for media commentators and pundits to quit picking at it, focusing on the trivial, and realize that it's there, it's deep and it's lasting where it counts.

        "title": "Sinopec Pact For Addax Boosts China's Buying Binge; Sinopec Pact For Addax Boosts China's Buying Binge",
        "original_text": "China again sought to satisfy its hunger for natural resources, as state-owned Sinopec Group agreed to acquire oil-exploration company Addax Petroleum Corp. for 8.27 billion Canadian dollars (US$7.19 billion), in what would mark the largest overseas takeover by a Chinese company. The deal increases Sinopec's presence in one of the world's hottest oil-exploration frontiers -- offshore West Africa -- and establishes it in oil-rich but politically sensitive Iraqi Kurdistan. The transaction also underscores the growing appetite for risk among Chinese resource companies. For years, they tended to tread cautiously, especially after U.S. political pressure forced Cnooc Ltd. to abandon its $18.5 billion bid for oil producer Unocal Corp. in 2005. But in the past year, Chinese state-owned companies have been encouraged to make acquisitions by a central government convinced that the global financial crisis has created an unmatched buying opportunity. They are taking advantage of depressed asset prices and access to Chinese credit to strike deals designed to secure the resources needed to power China's growing economy. The purchase also demonstrates growing confidence among Chinese energy companies. In the past, they have preferred to strike government-to-government deals and offer loans for oil. Over the past half-year, China has proffered more than $45 billion in loans to Russia, Brazil, Venezuela and Kazakhstan in exchange for long-term crude supplies. But deals like the Addax acquisition show they are gradually growing into international oil companies, capable of striking high-profile, cross-border deals. They are even expanding into countries, such as Syria, deemed too risky by Western oil companies. But not all of China's efforts have been successful. In early June, Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto Ltd. rejected Aluminum Corp. of China's $19.5 billion offer for part of the company after recovering markets made the deal financially unpalatable. That deal also faced economic, political and shareholder opposition, reflecting fears over the consequences of giving China direct access to big supplies of natural resources. The Addax deal also marks the first time a global oil giant has ventured into the Kurdish autonomous region of northern Iraq. Authorities in Baghdad have denounced as illegal the roughly 30 oil contracts negotiated between the Kurdish regional government and foreign energy companies like Addax. Western oil majors have steered clear of Kurdistan for fear of antagonizing the Iraqi government. Sinopec's foray into the region suggests the tide might be turning. Earlier this year, Iraqi Oil Minister Hussain al-Shahristani gave approval for foreign companies developing oil fields in the Kurdish region to export their crude directly to international markets. Addax was a beneficiary of the change and has been shipping oil since the start of this month. Still unclear, however, is how foreign companies will be compensated for the oil they export, with most sales revenues being channeled to Baghdad. \"The Sinopec deal shows the big boys are now more confident about investing in Kurdistan,\" said Helmut Langanger, head of exploration and production at OMV AG, the Austrian energy firm that is also drilling for oil in the Kurdish region. OMV says its presence in the north disqualified it from participating in Iraq's first oil-licensing round, scheduled for next week. \"The Chinese must feel comfortable that they can manage this, otherwise they would never have announced it,\" said one person familiar with the deal. Based in Switzerland and listed in London and Toronto, Addax is one of the largest independent oil producers in West Africa and the Middle East by volume. Aside from Kurdistan, it operates off Nigeria, an area that has seen huge exploration success in recent years. The company produced 136,500 barrels a day on average last year, or about 1.7% of China's daily consumption. China used about eight million barrels daily last year, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy. The deal is a coup for Addax Chief Executive Jean Claude Gandur, one of the founders and principal shareholders in the company. He is a Swiss citizen who grew up in the Egyptian city of Alexandria and started out as an oil trader in the 1970s. He set up his own West African trading operation, Addax & Oryx Group, in 1987 and later began acquiring stakes in oil fields while gaining a reputation as a buccaneer who thrived in tough, politically risky settings. In 1994, he hived off Addax's oil-exploration and development business into a separate company, Addax Petroleum, and listed it on the Toronto Stock Exchange 12 years later. Sinopec offered C$52.80 a share, 16% more than Tuesday's closing price in Toronto. In a statement, Addax said its board recommended that shareholders accept the offer and said senior executives, including Mr. Gandur, have agreed to sell their combined 38% stake to Sinopec. Sinopec called the acquisition \"a transformational transaction\" that would accelerate its international growth. --- Gina Chon contributed to this article.",
        "debiased_text": "Sinopec Group, a state-owned Chinese company, has agreed to acquire Addax Petroleum Corp. for 8.27 billion Canadian dollars (US$7.19 billion). This transaction represents the largest overseas takeover by a Chinese company to date. The deal expands Sinopec's operations in offshore West Africa, an area recognized for its significant oil-exploration potential, and also establishes its presence in the oil-rich region of Iraqi Kurdistan. The acquisition reflects a strategic move by Chinese resource companies to secure access to natural resources to support China's economic development. This step is part of a broader trend, as the central government has encouraged such transactions, citing opportunities arising from the global financial crisis, including depressed asset prices and access to Chinese credit. In recent years, Chinese companies have transitioned from primarily engaging in government-to-government deals and offering loans in exchange for oil supplies to pursuing more direct international investments. The Addax acquisition also highlights Sinopec's willingness to operate in regions considered risky by Western companies, such as Syria. However, not all of China's recent acquisition attempts have been successful; in early June, Rio Tinto Ltd. rejected a $19.5 billion offer from China's Aluminum Corp. for part of the company due to financial, economic, political, and shareholder concerns. The transaction with Addax marks the first time a global oil company has invested in the autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq. Iraqi authorities have previously labeled oil contracts between the Kurdish regional government and foreign companies as illegal, and Western oil companies have largely avoided the area to prevent conflict with the central government. Recently, the Iraqi Oil Minister approved direct exports of crude from foreign companies operating in the Kurdish region, which has allowed Addax to begin shipping oil. It remains uncertain how foreign companies will be compensated, as most sales revenues are directed to Baghdad. Helmut Langanger, head of exploration and production at OMV AG, noted that the Sinopec acquisition indicates increased confidence in investing in Kurdistan.

        "original_text": "Google is urging western governments to challenge internet censorship in countries such as China, saying the economic implications of stifled trade will become more grave if nothing is done. \"More than 40 governments now engage in broad-scale restriction of online information, a tenfold increase from just a decade ago,\" the US-based technology giant warns in a policy brief on internet trade restrictions published yesterday. The warning follows an embattled 12 months in China, where Google has had to comply with state censorship rules or risk being kicked out of the world's most populous internet market. Google yesterday denied its policy brief was sparked by developments in China, where the company lags some way behind the native Baidu in the search market, but said the country's government was capable of \"arbitrary and capricious behaviour\" in its dealings with internet companies. But in a rare public appearance the chairman of Baidu, the Chinese search engine which has the majority share there, said Google had failed to understand the market before it launched there in January 2006. \"China is a very different market. Market conditions change every day. If you are not close, it is difficult for you to keep up,\" said Robin Li at the Web 2.0 conference in San Francisco. Bob Boorstin, Google's director of public policy, said in a post on the company's blog: \"Governments are blocking online services, imposing non-transparent regulation, and seeking to incorporate surveillance tools into their internet infrastructure. These are the trade barriers of the 21st century economy. \"These actions unnecessarily restrict trade and, left unchecked, they will almost certainly get worse,\" the briefing warns. A row over hacking with China earlier this year led to the US technology giant withdrawing from its mainland offices and re-routing Chinese internet users via its Hong Kong service. The company later restored its original service, adding a prominent button to redirect users to the Hong Kong service and away from the so-called Great Firewall, when it renewed its Chinese business licence – a prerequisite for doing busines in the country – in July. In March Google said it was stopping the censorship of searches that the Chinese administration had demanded, following a sophisticated cyber attack originating from China directed at the Gmail account of dozens of human rights activists and at Google's internal systems. Google's share of the Chinese search market has continued to deteriorate since March, currently down from 24.2% to 21.6% in the third quarter, according to Beijing-based research firm Analysys International. Baidu has continued to grow during this time. Google has accused China of tilting the market in favour of Baidu, and said authorities in Vietnam, Turkey, Russia and Pakistan have all blocked information online in some form. Baidu's Li said earlier this week that his company's success, which saw it double its net profit to 1bn yuan (£98m) in the third quarter, had been aided by Google's falling share of the Chinese market. Li said he had urged the Google chief executive, Eric Schmidt, to spend at least six months in China when his company launched its service in China. A local domain version of Google, Google.cn, went live in January 2006. \"Apparently, Eric did not take my advice,\" he said. \"I knew that, eventually, he would hand me a gift, and it happened.\" Google urged the governments in the US and European Union to take \"concrete steps to ensure that rules in the next generation of trade agreements reflect new challenges of internet trade.\"",
        "debiased_text": "Google has advised Western governments to address internet censorship practices in countries like China, stating that the economic consequences of restricted trade may become more severe without action. A policy brief published by the US-based technology company on internet trade restrictions highlights that over 40 governments currently implement broad-scale online information limitations, marking a tenfold increase compared to a decade ago. This follows a challenging year for Google in China, where the company has been required to adhere to state-imposed censorship regulations to maintain its presence in the country's largest internet market. Google denied that its policy brief was directly influenced by recent events in China, where it trails behind Baidu, the local search engine with a dominant market share. The company described the Chinese government's actions toward internet firms as 'arbitrary and capricious.'\n\nRobin Li, chairman of Baidu, made a rare public statement at the Web 2.0 conference in San Francisco, commenting on Google's entry into the Chinese market in January 2006. He stated that China presents a distinct market environment, where conditions change frequently, and that companies must remain closely attuned to these shifts to succeed. In a blog post, Bob Boorstin, Google's director of public policy, noted that governments are blocking online services, implementing non-transparent regulations, and integrating surveillance tools into their internet infrastructure. These actions, according to the brief, constitute trade barriers in the modern economy and may worsen if not addressed.\n\nEarlier this year, a dispute involving hacking led Google to temporarily withdraw from its mainland offices and reroute Chinese internet users via its Hong Kong service. The company later reinstated its original service, adding a visible button to direct users to the Hong Kong service and bypass the so-called Great Firewall, following the renewal of its Chinese business license in July. In March, Google announced it would stop complying with the Chinese administration's demands for search censorship after a cyber attack, which originated from China, targeted the Gmail accounts of numerous human rights activists and Google's internal systems.\n\nAccording to Analysys International, a Beijing-based research firm, Google's share of the Chinese search market has declined from 24.2% to 21.6% during the third quarter. Baidu has experienced continued growth during this period. Google has alleged that Chinese authorities have created a market environment that favors Baidu and noted similar online information blocking practices in Vietnam, Turkey, Russia, and Pakistan. Robin Li stated this week that Baidu's success has been influenced by Google's reduced market presence in China. He previously encouraged Google's CEO, Eric Schmidt, to spend at least six months in China when the company first launched its service there. A local domain version of Google, Google.cn, was launched in January 2006. Li remarked that Eric Schmidt did not follow his advice, but that he eventually received the benefit of Google's reduced presence in the market. Google is calling on the US and EU governments to implement 'concrete steps' to ensure that future trade agreements incorporate rules addressing new challenges in internet trade."

        "original_text": "China accused Japan of \"violating Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity\", reopening a bitter row between the two countries over disputed islands in the East China Sea. The renewed diplomatic tensions scuppered plans for a Sino-Japanese summit meeting in Hanoi on Friday that had been seen as a key step toward calming ties between the world's second and third-largest economies. China also rebuked Hillary Clinton, US secretary of state, saying it was \"strongly dissatisfied\" with remarks she had made that appeared to take Japan's side in the argument over the islands. The revival of the dispute first sparked by Japan's detention of a Chinese fisherman near the disputed Senkaku islands last month threatened to cast a pall over a two-day gathering of regional leaders in the Vietnamese capital. Japanese officials said China had cancelled at the last moment what would have been the first formal encounter since the dispute between Wen Jiabao, Chinese premier, and Naoto Kan, Japan's prime minister. The meeting had been agreed earlier on Friday at an apparently cordial encounter between foreign ministers of the two countries. However, Hu Zhengyue, a Chinese assistant foreign minister, later denounced Japan for \"unceasingly disseminating\" comments through the media that he said had violated China's sovereignty. Japan had made \"untrue statements\" about the content of the foreign ministers' meeting, Mr Hu said. \"This has destroyed the proper atmosphere for a meeting of the two nation's leaders in Hanoi,\" China's official Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying. China earlier denied a report that it had agreed to restart negotiations on a deal to jointly exploit gas resources in disputed areas of the East China Sea. But Japanese officials dismissed suggestions they had ever made such a claim. \"It's extremely regrettable that the Chinese side has cancelled the summit meeting because of a baseless report,\" said Tetsuro Fukuyama, Japan's deputy chief cabinet secretary. Mr Fukuyama said Tokyo had been \"extremely surprised\" by the cancellation of the premiers' meeting, but that Japan would respond \"calmly\". The renewed frictions over the Senkakus, which China knows as the Diaoyu islands, could further complicate already sensitive relations between Beijing and Washington. Tokyo had hoped that a formal meeting between Mr Wen and Mr Kan would help smooth preparations for a summit next month of Asia-Pacific nations to be held in the Japanese port city of Yokohama. Beijing's criticism of Mrs Clinton came after she met Seiji Maehara, Japan's foreign minister, and restated the US position that it is committed to help Japan defend the Senkakus against foreign attack under the terms of its security treaty with Tokyo. Mrs Clinton was to join discussions among regional leaders on Saturday for talks hoped to ease differences between China and the US and between Beijing and some other governments in south-east Asia. In a speech in Hawaii, en route to a 13-day Asia trip, Mrs Clinton struck a conciliatory note but admitted there were still difficult issues between the US and China. \"There are some in both countries who believe that China's interests and ours are fundamentally at odds . . . But that is not our view,\" she said. Mrs Clinton is due to travel on Saturday to Hainan, the island in southern China, to meet with Dai Bingguo, the leading Chinese foreign policy official.

        "debiased_text": "China expressed concerns regarding Japan's actions near the disputed Senkaku islands in the East China Sea, stating that Japan had violated Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity. This led to a deterioration in diplomatic relations between the two countries and the cancellation of a planned Sino-Japanese summit meeting in Hanoi on Friday. The summit had been anticipated as an important step in stabilizing relations between the world's second and third-largest economies. China also expressed strong dissatisfaction with comments made by Hillary Clinton, the U.S. Secretary of State, which appeared to support Japan's position on the islands. The dispute was initially triggered by Japan's detention of a Chinese fisherman near the islands last month, which threatened to overshadow a two-day regional leaders' gathering in the Vietnamese capital.

Mrs. Clinton was scheduled to attend regional discussions on Saturday to address differences between the U.S. and China and between China and some other Southeast Asian governments.

        "title": "The China Dream: Why the Middle Kingdom isn't really taking over the world.; The China Dream:   Why the Middle Kingdom isn't really taking over the world.",
        "original_text": "The rise of china is, as we all know by now, the definitive economic and political story of our time. Every week a new book title announces an \"irresistible\" tilt east, the emergence of \"Chimerica\" and a not-too-distant future when China \"rules\" the planet. The mainstream media, and especially the business press, are gripped by the narrative of China taking over the world--every other headline in the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal has a China focus. But the coverage of China's global inroads has been profoundly short on context, particularly when it comes to how China is--and is not--surpassing the U.S. as a global power. There are plenty of stories of a Chinese-sponsored infrastructure project or a Chinese company cutting a deal to feed its \"insatiable thirst\" for raw materials, while Western involvement of similar or greater magnitude is lucky to make a headline at all. Meanwhile, a close look at the key economic metrics and the subtler shades of power, such as cultural influence and humanitarian aid, reveals that while China is indeed one of the great powers in the world now (late last month it officially overtook Japan as the world's second-largest economy), its influence is mixed, and often undercut by America's. While China's trade with regions like Africa and Latin America is growing exponentially, it is still outpaced by America's, which tends to be more diverse. In Asia, China is now the dominant trading partner, yet the flows are mainly in low-end goods, while America dominates higher up the food chain. U.S. aid and foreign direct investment in these regions still eclipses that of the Chinese, and its soft power still reigns, as does its military might, despite recent Chinese buildups in this area. \"Economic heft alone has never been enough for a country to be dominant outside its borders,\" says Charles Onyango-Obbo, a journalist who writes for the weekly newspaper The East African. He recently penned a column titled \"Chinese Takeover? I'm Not Losing Any Sleep.\" \"It's really been American education, technology, culture [Hollywood and music], business, and sport that has enabled it to be so overarching,\" says Onyango-Obbo. \"China is going to be a very important power in the world, but it will not be dominant.\" Perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than in Africa, where China has been depicted as the shrewd winner of a neocolonial scramble for resources, offering developmental assistance--mainly in the form of low-priced manufactured goods, infrastructure investment, and soft loans--all proffered with no pesky Western-style demands to respect human rights. In exchange, China gets access to raw materials to fuel its economic boom. No doubt China's presence on the continent has expanded considerably in recent years. But the U.S. remains sub-Saharan Africa's largest trading partner, accounting for 15 percent of Africa's total trade versus 10 percent for the Chinese (it's also worth noting that Africa has been a low trading priority for the U.S., accounting for a mere 2 percent of its global trade). Indeed, the bulk of China-Africa trade is made up of Chinese oil imports from five countries, and even with respect to oil--said to be at the heart of China's drive on the continent--America holds a sizable lead. China imports 17 percent of all African oil compared with 29 percent for the U.S. (and 35 percent for Europe). Western companies are the leading foreign partners in oil projects in Nigeria, which is sub-Saharan Africa's largest oil producer, and in the continent's largest emerging oil producers such as Ghana and Uganda. This trend may well continue, in part because of allegations of corruption and shoddy execution in a number of Chinese energy and infrastructure projects throughout Africa. An $8 billion Chinese-sponsored road and mine project in Congo, deemed the \"Marshall Plan of Africa\" when it was unveiled a couple of years ago, has been tainted by allegations of corruption and poor implementation, as has a massive Chinese-funded fiber-optic project in Uganda. A recent study from the African Labor Research Network, called \"Chinese Investments in Africa: A Labour Perspective,\" looked at labor conditions at Chinese companies in 10 African countries and found them \"among the worst employers everywhere,\" according to the report's author, Herbert Jauch. Disenchantment with the Middle Kingdom is particularly strong in Angola and Nigeria, which a few years ago were both tilting China's way, lured by the promise of soft, unconditional development loans and noninterference in domestic politics. Two-way trade between China and Nigeria doubled to $7 billion between 2006 and 2008 (though still dwarfed by $42 billion with the U.S. in 2008). Yet Nigeria's late president Umaru Yar'Adua ended up canceling a number of the projects due to scandals and delays. Washington has been quietly capitalizing; according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, exports to Nigeria have risen 48 percent and imports (consisting predominantly of oil) by 16 percent this year alone. The situation is the same in Angola, where Angolan Rafael Marques de Morais, founder of Maka, which monitors corruption in the country, says, \"Corruption and a lack of accountability on China-Angola deals have undermined a more sustainable and long-term relationship between the two countries.\" He points to the General Hospital built by Chinese contractors in Luanda, the capital's first new hospital since independence, which \"four years after its inauguration is basically collapsing.\" In July patients and staff were evacuated due to safety concerns. Once again, Washington moved to exploit disenchantment with Beijing, meeting with Angolan officials in June to discuss ways to deepen and diversify trade, and pushing a newly signed IMF agreement of understanding that may lead to fresh loans from Western banks. This underscores America's deeper and more diversified engagement not only with Africa, but many other parts of the world, via international institutions as well as humanitarian aid and military assistance. Despite high-profile ties with Zimbabwe and Sudan, China has little military presence in Africa and almost none in Latin America, and is still overshadowed by the U.S. even within its own backyard. Last month in Hanoi, for instance, the U.S. was a welcome presence at the ASEAN Regional Forum, Asia's largest security meeting, amid growing concerns about China's military buildup and its claims to the disputed Paracel and Spratly islands, which are also claimed in part by Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Obama plans to invite ASEAN leaders to a second U.S. ASEAN meeting in the fall, and ASEAN foreign ministers have invited the U.S. to a regional dialogue, known as the East Asia Summit, which diplomats reportedly said would help counter Chinese influence in the region. Washington recently boosted humanitarian and military aid to Laos and Cambodia and removed them from a trade blacklist, which should attract more U.S. investment. And in July Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Pham Gia Khiem said America and Vietnam are \"leaving the past behind\" as they strengthen commercial and military ties. Their two-way trade leapt from $2.91 billion in 2002 to $15.4 billion last year. The U.S. has made similar progress with Indonesia, signing an agreement in April that will allow greater American capital flows into Southeast Asia's largest economy. Of course, Asia is still the one region in the world where China now dominates regional trade--overall trade between China and the rest of the continent hit $231 billion versus the U.S.'s $178 billion in 2008. But most of the flows are in intermediary goods of low value (China buys cheap components and raw materials from poorer nations and uses them to make products for export, just as it supplies the same to richer nations like South Korea). This trade does not foster the skills transfer that Southeast Asian countries so desperately need in their bid to move up the technology ladder. Countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia still rely on entrepreneurial, technological, and educational engagement with the U.S. for that. And America still accounts for a far greater chunk of regional foreign direct investment--8.5 percent versus China's 3.8 percent, or $3.4 billion to $1.5 billion, in 2009. Experts such as Elizabeth Economy, director of Asia studies for the Council on Foreign Relations, believe that the moves toward closer U.S. political, economic, and security cooperation in Southeast Asia will continue. \"There's no intention of wasting the opportunity,\" she says. In other places where China is increasingly prominent economically, such as Latin America, the U.S. still has important cards to play as well. Last year China replaced the U.S. as Brazil's leading trading partner, and it's now the second-largest trading partner in Venezuela, Chile, Peru, Costa Rica, and Argentina. But while Asia's overall trade with the region (driven largely by China) rose 96 percent over the past decade, the U.S. saw an even greater rise--118 percent--in total trade. And according to Shanghai's SinoLatin Capital, China's accumulated investment in Latin America by the close of 2008 was a mere $12 billion--or less than the state of Michigan invests in the region, according to China Economic Review. As in many regions, there are cultural and geographical barriers to closer China-Latin America relations. \"The U.S. and Latin America are doomed to live closely together, and China can never compete with that,\" says Kevin Casas-Zamora, a Latin America expert with the Brookings Institution. America's soft-power appeal in the region dwarfs China's, resonating through popular culture, language, and ideals. Most Latin American countries are functioning or aspiring democracies, and despite China's attempts to attract interest in Chinese language and culture via Confucius Institutes (300 are being rolled out around the world, including 21 in Latin America), there remain few Chinese speakers in Latin America and Spanish speakers in China. Soft power is also very much at play in Africa, particularly given President Obama's connection to the region (everything from restaurants to car washes are named after him). Signs of American culture, from film to music to fashion, permeate the region. African students still dream of going to the U.S. to study, and English is very much the language to learn. What's more, the U.S. still tends to be the country to call when there is trouble. Consider the terrorist bombings in Kampala, Uganda, that left more than 85 people dead this summer. President Yoweri Museveni had been trading barbs with Washington prior to the incident about the pace of democratic reforms in his country. Museveni had also been tightening relations with China. But after the bombings, he swiftly turned not to Beijing but to Washington for assistance, and received $24 million in manpower and technical resources. This sort of effort, particularly when contrasted with China's recent political bumbles in Africa and elsewhere (for example, its growing reputation for shoddy construction work in Africa; its South China Sea squabbles with its Asian neighbors), makes America look good and underscores the opportunity for it to better play the myriad cards it has at its disposal--cultural, military, scientific, and economic. Many of these were underutilized or misused during its two decades as the world's lone superpower. To the extent that China's rise forces America's nimble reengagement with the world, the effect may be win-win.",
        "debiased_text": "The economic and political developments involving China have been a significant topic of discussion in recent years. Various media outlets, particularly the business press, have increasingly focused on China's influence and its potential to surpass the United States as a global power. The narrative often centers on China's infrastructure projects and trade agreements with regions such as Africa and Latin America, where its involvement has grown notably. However, there is a lack of comprehensive context about how China's influence compares to that of the United States in different aspects of global engagement.\n\nChina has become one of the leading global powers, having recently overtaken Japan as the second-largest economy. Nevertheless, its influence in certain regions is not absolute. For example, in Africa, while China's trade with the continent has expanded, the United States remains the largest trading partner for sub-Saharan Africa, contributing 15 percent of Africa's total trade compared to China's 10 percent. The U.S. also accounts for only 2 percent of its global trade, indicating that Africa is not a top priority for American trade.\n\nMost of China-Africa trade consists of oil imports, with China importing 17 percent of all African oil compared to the U.S. importing 29 percent. Western companies continue to be the principal foreign partners in oil projects in several African countries. In Nigeria, a key oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa, trade with China doubled between 2006 and 2008, though still significantly lower than trade with the U.S. Some projects canceled by Nigerian leaders were attributed to issues of corruption and project delays. This coincided with a rise in U.S. exports to Nigeria by 48 percent and oil imports by 16 percent in recent years.\n\nA similar situation exists in Angola, where reports highlight issues of corruption and lack of accountability affecting major Chinese projects like a hospital in Luanda, which experienced structural failures and required evacuation. In response, the U.S. engaged with Angolan officials to deepen trade ties and supported an agreement with the International Monetary Fund that could bring Western banking involvement.\n\nIn Asia, China has a dominant role in regional trade, with overall trade with the continent reaching $231 billion in 2008, compared to $178 billion for the U.S. Despite this, much of the trade consists of goods of low value, such as raw materials and intermediaries, rather than fostering substantial skills transfer. In terms of foreign direct investment, the United States accounts for a larger share in the region than China does. Changes in U.S. foreign policy, including increased aid and enhanced trade relationships, reflect ongoing efforts to strengthen its presence in regions like Southeast Asia and Latin America.\n\nIn Latin America, China's economic influence has grown, replacing the U.S. as Brazil's top trading partner and becoming the second-largest partner for several countries. However, U.S. trade with the region also grew significantly, increasing by 118 percent over the past decade. Chinese investments in the region were reported at $12 billion by 2008, a figure smaller than the state of Michigan's investment in the same region, as per some reports.\n\nCultural and geographical factors may hinder closer relations between China and Latin America. While China has established a number of Confucius Institutes in the region to promote its language and culture, the number of Chinese speakers in Latin America remains low. Additionally, the U.S. holds greater influence through its cultural presence, including film, music, and fashion, as well as its support of democratic ideals.\n\nIn Africa, cultural influences from the U.S. remain strong, with many African students aspiring to study in the U.S. and English being a preferred language. President Barack Obama's connection to the region has also contributed to the appeal of American culture, with elements of American influence evident in various sectors. The U.S. has also been called upon in times of crisis, such as after the terrorist attacks in Kampala, Uganda, where President Yoweri Museveni requested assistance from Washington rather than Beijing.\n\nThere are indications that the U.S. will continue to strengthen its political, economic, and security ties in Southeast Asia, in part to counterbalance Chinese influence. The United States' long-standing relationships with Latin American and African countries, including through humanitarian and military aid, suggest that U.S. engagement could continue to grow in response to China's rising influence in those areas. The resurgence of U.S. global engagement, in light of China's expansion, may lead to mutually beneficial outcomes."

        "title": "David Cameron letting China off climate change hook, says Labour",
        "original_text": "David Cameron was accused last night of sending the wrong signals on climate change to China, the world's biggest polluter, as he prepared to lead the largest-ever official UK delegation to the country. He will be accompanied by George Osborne, the chancellor, business secretary Vince Cable, the climate and energy secretary, Chris Huhne, and Michael Gove, the education minister, as well as more than 50 business leaders on the two-day visit starting on Tuesday. Efforts to boost bilateral trade, and concerns over human rights, are expected to head the agenda in talks with President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. China is the UK's second-biggest trade partner after the EU. But last night Labour claimed that carefully constructed efforts to bind the Chinese into international efforts to invest in low-carbon technology and improve energy security were being undermined by government cuts. Shadow foreign secretary Yvette Cooper said William Hague, the foreign secretary, was giving the wrong message by slashing a £14.4m fund set up in 2008 to provide expertise to China and other countries on low-carbon technology and to help them to move away from coal-based technology. Funding was cut by £3m in the summer for the Low Carbon High Growth Fund and it is believed to be under further threat after the spending review. Hague has said he would examine other ways to finance the fund. Cooper said there was now a danger of international momentum being lost ahead of the UN climate change summit in Cancún starting later this month. The biggest success of the FCO fund was the designation of Jilin City in the north-east of China as the first pilot for a \"low carbon zone\". \"Putting less emphasis on climate change in foreign policy is a big strategic mistake. We won't ever solve climate change in one country; it has to be a global effort, \" Cooper said. The visit will see Cameron having to walk diplomatic tightropes on several issues. His judgment on foreign affairs was called into question before the general election when he appeared to lump China together with Iran in a television debate, saying Britain should retain its independent nuclear deterrent because \"we don't know what is going to happen with Iran [and] we can't be certain of the future in China\". Chinese officials will not want Cameron to raise human rights; but they are realistic, and know he will do so. He is expected to discuss the case of Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel peace prize winner serving 11 years for co-authoring a call for democratic reforms. A tough public condemnation of Liu's imprisonment, especially if delivered alongside a Chinese minister, would enrage Beijing. Since Liu was awarded the prize for his non-violent calls for political reform, the Chinese authorities have put scores of political dissidents and human rights activists in jail or under house arrest. Artist Ai Weiwei, who helped to design the Bird's Nest stadium for the 2008 Olympics, has been placed under house arrest after planning a party at his Shanghai studio to draw attention to government efforts to demolish the building. The party became a focus of attention for dissidents across the country. A Downing Street spokesman refused to say which cases the prime minister would want to discuss. Sir George Young, the leader of the Commons, told MPs last week: \"The prime minister will raise the serious issue about the human rights record of China. That issue will not go by default.\" A survey by the British Chamber of Commerce in China to coincide with the visit shows businesses broadly confident of increasing trade with the country – 36% of respondents expect demand for their products and services to increase significantly while 44% expect a more modest increase. And 25% of respondents saw their performance in China as in line with that in other markets, while 30% saw it as above average and 21% as significantly above average.",

Cooper also mentioned that the fund may face further budget reductions following the spending review, although Foreign Secretary William Hague has indicated that alternative funding methods may be explored. Cooper warned that reducing emphasis on climate change in foreign policy could be a strategic error, as climate change is a global challenge that requires international cooperation. The visit is expected to involve Cameron navigating multiple diplomatic issues. His handling of foreign affairs was criticized prior to the general election when he grouped China with Iran in a television debate, stating the need for the UK to maintain its independent nuclear deterrent due to uncertainties regarding both countries. Chinese officials are unlikely to welcome direct references to human rights but are aware that Cameron is expected to address the issue. It is anticipated that discussions will include the case of Liu Xiaobo, a Nobel Peace Prize winner currently serving an 11-year sentence for co-authoring a call for democratic reforms. Public criticism of Liu's imprisonment, particularly if delivered in conjunction with a Chinese minister, could cause tension with Beijing. Since Liu's award, the Chinese authorities have detained numerous political dissidents and human rights activists. Ai Weiwei, an artist known for his role in designing the Bird's Nest stadium for the 2008 Olympics, has been under house arrest following plans to host a gathering at his Shanghai studio to highlight government actions involving the demolition of the building. The gathering drew attention from dissidents nationwide. A Downing Street spokesperson did not specify which human rights cases would be discussed by the prime minister. Sir George Young, the leader of the Commons, stated last week that the prime minister would raise the significant issue of China's human rights record, noting that this matter would not be ignored. A survey conducted by the British Chamber of Commerce in China, released in conjunction with the visit, indicates that businesses are generally optimistic about increasing trade with the country. According to the survey, 36% of respondents expect a significant rise in demand for their products and services, while 44% anticipate a more modest increase.

Were it not for the workers' distinctive Honda uniforms, the dispute might have been seen as merely a local affair. Yet analysts say its causes can be partly traced to Honda's roots in Japan, a country whose painstaking and often insular management style can travel poorly outside its borders. Industrial unrest is hardly unusual in China, where grievances held by a new generation of young migrant workers are both deep and widespread. Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics group that makes gadgets for western brands such as Apple, is raising pay and revamping its \"factory town\" business model after a spate of suicides at its main plant in southern China. Yet in the automobile industry, at least, Japanese companies stand out for the frequency and seriousness of recent labour problems. Over the past month, eight Honda and Toyota suppliers in China have been hit by strikes, which in many cases have forced the shutdown of the larger assembly plants that rely on their output. \"When it comes to their China operations, Japanese companies have merely changed location. They haven't changed their way of doing business at all,\" says Hiroyoshi Ikeda, chief executive of Myts, a consulting firm that advises Japanese companies expanding overseas. Mr Ikeda and other experts note that Japanese manufacturers typically bring their tightly knit keiretsu relationships with them to China, making them more dependent on a small number of trusted suppliers. Since those suppliers often struggle to pass cost increases on to their \"customer\" parents, they are under greater pressure to keep a lid on worker pay. \"[The strikes] have brought out the weakness in Japanese-style just-in-time production,\" says Kiyoshi Kasahara of Rikkyo University. When workers strike, Japanese groups' taut supply lines mean shortages ripple quickly along the chain, turning what might have been a minor nuisance for a US or European car assembler into a major disruption. Politics and culture may also be playing a role. While none of the strikers interviewed by the Financial Times over a period of weeks expressed explicitly anti-Japanese sentiment or referred to Japan's invasion of China in the 1930s, analysts say local authorities may be more reluctant to crack down on strikes at Japanese companies. In the past, accusations that leaders have gone soft on China's one-time enemy have escalated into broader anti-government protests. In interviews, workers did complain about their Japanese supervisors' remoteness and vastly greater pay packages. \"They don't speak Chinese - all communication is through interpreters - and they make tens of thousands of yuan a month,\" said one worker at Honda Lock, who earns a basic monthly salary of Rmb1,130 ($166). Such grievances highlight what experts say is Japanese carmakers' slowness to promote Chinese employees to management positions. Japanese companies see meticulous co-ordination of everything from component deliveries to greetings on the factory floor as one of their biggest competitive advantages - a perception that has made them reluctant to yield control to outsiders. \"Japanese executives don't really trust foreigners,\" says Yukio Kajita, a professor at Reitaku University. He notes that it has taken decades for Toyota, Honda and others to install high-ranking local managers in the US and Europe . \"[Chinese workers] conclude that even if they work hard they won't advance.\" Mr Kasahara at Rikkyo says Japanese companies may also place too much faith in China's state-controlled official union, whose one-shop-per-company structure superficially resembles Japan's. The union is often distrusted by workers, and many western groups have gone out of their way to build informal grievance networks to get around it.

        "debiased_text": "When a strike occurred at a Honda components factory in southern China this month, the Chinese deputy general manager requested the workers to return to their posts. The workers refused to resume work, prompting a senior executive from Guangzhou Automobile, a partner of Honda in the region, to engage in negotiation efforts. As the situation escalated, the only presence of Japanese executives was the signature of the expat general manager on a notice urging the workers to return to their positions or face consequences under relevant national laws, regulations, and company policies. The distinctive Honda uniforms of the workers indicated their affiliation with the company, which analysts suggest could be a factor in highlighting the issue beyond a local context. Industrial unrest is common in China, particularly among a new generation of young migrant workers who frequently express grievances. Recently, Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer producing items for international brands such as Apple, has increased wages and adjusted its business model following a series of incidents at its primary plant in southern China. In the automobile industry, Japanese companies appear to have encountered a notable number of labor issues. Over the past month, eight Honda and Toyota suppliers in China experienced strikes, which in several instances led to the closure of larger assembly plants depending on their components. Hiroyoshi Ikeda, chief executive of Myts, a consulting firm that supports Japanese companies expanding overseas, states that Japanese companies have relocated their operations to China, but have not adapted their business practices. Japanese manufacturers tend to retain their keiretsu relationships, which involve a network of trusted suppliers, resulting in greater dependency on fewer partners. These suppliers frequently face challenges in passing on increased costs to their main clients, leading to pressure to limit worker wages. Kiyoshi Kasahara from Rikkyo University notes that the strikes have revealed weaknesses in Japan's just-in-time production model. Disruptions in the supply chain caused by strikes can lead to significant issues for Japanese carmakers, unlike for US or European car assemblers that may experience less severe interruptions. Politics and culture may also influence the events. Although none of the interviewed workers explicitly expressed anti-Japanese sentiments or referenced historical events like Japan's invasion of China in the 1930s, analysts suggest that local authorities may be hesitant to take strong actions against strikes at Japanese companies. In the past, perceived leniency from authorities towards Japan has led to broader anti-government protests. Workers have reported issues with communication barriers and perceived disparities in pay between Japanese supervisors and themselves. One worker at Honda Lock mentioned that Japanese supervisors do not speak Chinese, relying on interpreters for communication, and earn significantly more than the workers, who receive a base wage of Rmb1,130 ($166) per month. These concerns emphasize the slow pace at which Japanese carmakers have promoted Chinese employees to management roles. Japanese companies view precise coordination, from component delivery to workplace interactions, as a key competitive strength, making them reluctant to assign control to non-Japanese personnel. Yukio Kajita, a professor at Reitaku University, indicates that Toyota, Honda, and others have required several decades to place high-ranking local managers in the US and Europe. He suggests that Chinese workers often perceive that hard work does not lead to advancement opportunities within the company. Kiyoshi Kasahara also notes that Japanese companies may place excessive trust in China's official, state-controlled unions, which are structured to have one union per company. Workers often distrust this structure, and some Western companies have established informal networks for addressing grievances."

        "original_text": "What a contrast. In a year that's on track to be our planet's hottest on record, America turned \"climate change\" into a four-letter word that many U.S. politicians won't even dare utter in public. For starters, it helped scuttle Senate passage of the energy-climate bill needed to scale U.S.-made clean technologies, leaving America at a distinct disadvantage in the next great global industry.\n\"There is really no debate about climate change in China,\" said Peggy Liu, chairwoman of the Joint U.S.-China Collaboration on Clean Energy, a nonprofit group working to accelerate the greening of China.\nThe push for green in China, she added, \"is a practical discussion on health and wealth. There is no need to emphasize future consequences when people already see, eat and breathe pollution every day.\"\nAnd because runaway pollution in China means wasted lives, air, water, ecosystems and money, China's leaders would never go a year (like we will) without energy legislation mandating new ways to do more with less. By becoming more energy efficient per unit of GDP, China saves money, takes the lead in the next great global industry and earns credit with the world for mitigating climate change.\nSo while America's Republicans turned \"climate change\" into a four-letter word - J-O-K-E - China's Communists also turned it into a four-letter word - J-O-B-S.\nChina has designated and invested in pilot cities for electric vehicles, smart grids, LED lighting, rural biomass and low-carbon communities. But China's capability limitations require that it reach out for partners. This is a great opportunity for U.S. clean-tech firms - if we nurture them. Chinese companies are good at making a billion widgets at a penny each but not good at complex system integration or customer service.\nWe (sort of) have those capabilities. At the World Economic Forum meeting here, I met Mike Biddle, founder of MBA Polymers, which has invented processes for separating plastic from piles of junked computers, appliances and cars and then recycling it into pellets to make new plastic. In the last three years, his company has mined 100 million pounds of new plastic from old plastic.\nBiddle's seed money was provided mostly by U.S. taxpayers through federal research grants, yet his factories are in Austria, China and Britain. Biddle had enough money to hire one lobbyist to try to persuade the U.S. Congress to copy the recycling regulations of Europe, Japan and China in our energy bill, but, in the end, there was no bill. So we educated him, we paid for his tech breakthroughs - and now Chinese and European workers will harvest his fruit.\nThomas Friedman is a columnist with The New York Times.

        "debiased_text": "In a year that is projected to be the hottest on record, the United States has seen limited public discussion on the topic of climate change among some politicians. This lack of discourse has affected efforts to pass legislation related to energy and climate issues, which would have supported the development of clean technologies in the U.S.\n\nPeggy Liu, chairwoman of the Joint U.S.-China Collaboration on Clean Energy, a nonprofit organization, stated that there is no debate about climate change in China. She emphasized that the focus in China is on practical aspects such as health and wealth, as pollution is a daily reality for many people there.\n\nChina's efforts to address pollution are linked to its economic approach, which includes energy efficiency improvements per unit of GDP. This strategy helps save money, positions the country to lead in emerging global industries, and earns international recognition for mitigating climate change.\n\nChina has established pilot cities dedicated to various green technologies including electric vehicles, smart grids, LED lighting, rural biomass, and low-carbon communities. However, due to certain limitations, China seeks partnerships to advance these initiatives. This presents an opportunity for U.S. clean technology firms, provided they continue to develop and support these technologies.\n\nChinese companies are known for producing large quantities of goods at low costs but may lack expertise in complex system integration and customer service. U.S. firms have capabilities in these areas.\n\nAt the World Economic Forum, Mike Biddle, founder of MBA Polymers, discussed the company's processes for separating and recycling plastic from discarded computers, appliances, and vehicles. Over the past three years, MBA Polymers has recycled 100 million pounds of plastic. Federal research grants largely funded the company's initial development, and its factories are now located in Austria, China, and Britain. Biddle attempted to influence U.S. Congress to adopt similar recycling regulations to those in Europe, Japan, and China, but no such legislation was passed. As a result, the economic benefits from these technologies may now be reaped by workers in China and Europe."

Part of the subsidies will finance a 30 per cent price cut, introduced on May 1, for 3G subscription packages that come with an iPhone. China Unicom's efforts to woo customers highlight the growing cost for telecoms operators of securing market share in the world's biggest mobile market.

But six months later, iPhone sales are still slow and continue to be outpaced by grey-market imports. China Mobile, meanwhile, keeps adding new subscribers at 3.5 times the pace of China Unicom. Cheaper smartphones will help, but might not be enough as China Unicom's rivals have been at least as aggressive in expanding their high-end handset offerings.

        "debiased_text": "BEIJING -- The Chinese government is seeking to address diplomatic challenges following recent criticism in international relations. Chinese President Hu Jintao is scheduled to meet with President Barack Obama on Jan. 19, which includes an official state dinner and a meeting in the Oval Office, as announced by the White House on Thursday.

        "title": "An assertive China stirs an anxious conversation; An assertive China stirs an anxious conversation",
        "original_text": "Spend time in Japan with politicians and policymakers and the conversation always starts with China. After a while the talk turns to the US. Then it's back to China. The connecting thread is anxiety. Angst about Beijing's intentions competes with concern about waning American power. For a European, the exchanges are unsettling. Europe, of course, itself risks being left in the shadows of history by the world's new powers. For now, though, its organising emotions are introspection and complacency. Europe prefers to close its eyes to the shift in the geopolitical centre of gravity from the Atlantic to the Pacific. While the US and China argued it out over global economic imbalances at this month's gathering of Group of 20 nations in Seoul, the Europeans talked to themselves about the euro. Clutching his British pounds, David Cameron, the prime minister, remarked that the summit had allowed him to catch up on sleep lost to his baby. For Japan, the stakes in the global upheaval are higher and the scars of past enmities fresher. China has replaced it as the world's second largest economy and elbowed aside the US as the region's biggest trading partner. Beijing is building a powerful navy. It has declared the South China Sea a \"core\" strategic interest alongside Taiwan and Tibet. It has also - and this is what has tipped the mood in Tokyo - adopted an unapologetically assertive tone. Europeans think of China as a competitor to the US on the global stage. For Japan, China is next door. Geography and history dictate that the challenge is territorial as well as economic. Everyone in the policymaking establishment has learnt by heart the language of constructive engagement. But it does not take long before they begin to fret about what they see as China's hegemonic ambitions. This autumn's clash over the Japanese-controlled Senkaku (Diaoyu in Chinese) islands in the East China Sea crystallised the anxiety. The detention and subsequent release by the Japanese authorities of a Chinese fishing captain owed more to cock-up than conspiracy. An aide to Japan's prime minister Naoto Kan told me Beijing had misread Tokyo's intentions. Maybe, but confusion descended pretty quickly into confrontation. The vehemence of Beijing's reaction to the arrest, which included a ban on exports to Japan of rare earth minerals, seemed calculated to make a bigger point. China will not countenance challenges from lesser powers. These territorial disputes are everywhere in Asia. Japan has separate arguments with Russia and South Korea. At least half-a-dozen states lay claim to an outcrop of islands in the South China Sea. The Himalayan land border between India and China remains a constant source of tension. The disputes are made dangerous by old hostilities and potent nationalisms; and by the absence of anything resembling a security architecture in which they can be defused. Europeans find themselves reminded of the combustible condition of their own continent at the close of the 19th century. Not everyone in Tokyo thinks China is aiming for untrammelled primacy. At a gathering organised by the Japan-UK 21st century group, a distinguished Japanese Sinologist handed me a copy of the 2008 partnership agreement between the two countries. This statement proclaimed a \"mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interests\". Regional security and prosperity, it avowed, rested on cordial ties between China and Japan. Party leaders in Beijing, my Sinologist friend said, well understood the mutuality of interest. Others are less sanguine. Some diplomats think the force of China's response to the fishing incident reflects a power struggle in which the People's Liberation Army has been gaining the upper hand. Others speculate that modernisers in Beijing feel the need to play the nationalist tunes of conservative rivals. What strikes an outsider is an almost complete lack of trust. The irrefutable logic of strategic interdependence struggles to compete with the deep mutual suspicion. This is where Japan's most important ally comes in. The outcome of the Seoul summit seemed to confirm a conventional wisdom: the US can no longer get its way in a bust-up with China. For all the pomp and circumstance of his four-nation Asian tour, Barack Obama was seen to leave Seoul a diminished president. Well, yes and no. Even as it laments the US's relative decline, Japan wants to hug its ally still closer. In that it is far from alone. There have been some squalls in the bilateral relationship since the Democratic Party of Japan took office last year. A dispute over a US marine base on Okinawa has not been properly resolved. But everyone in Tokyo wants to sustain the partnership. The point was underlined by the loud expressions of relief when Washington stated publicly that the disputed Senkaku islands were covered under the two nations' security treaty. There you have the paradox - even as everyone talks about its relative decline, the US is more sought in the region than it has been for some time. No one thinks China can be contained. Just about everyone has decided to hedge against its rise. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, says she feels more welcome now than ever before. Her statement during a regional summit in Hanoi that the US has a national interest in the free navigation of the South China Sea provoked fury in China - and a fair deal of quiet applause elsewhere. Mr Obama's visit to Delhi was calculated to underscore the strategic nature of US-Indian ties - holding up a mirror to the permanent tension in India's relations with China. Elsewhere, Washington has been invited to join the East Asia Summit. South Korea has sought to refurbish its longstanding alliance. Vietnam has been making friendly overtures towards its old adversary. Indonesia, a stopover on Mr Obama's trip, has also been tilting towards the US. So there's the rub. Diminished it may be, but the US remains indispensable. The harsher China's tone, the more eager its neighbours are to get closer to the US. Japan's anxious conversation about China is also being heard in a lot of other places in Asia. There must be a moral there for policymakers in Beijing. philip.stephens@ft.com",
        "debiased_text": "In discussions among Japanese politicians and policymakers, China often emerges as a primary topic of conversation, frequently alternating with references to the United States. The prevailing sentiment appears to center on concerns related to global economic imbalances and shifts in geopolitical influence. European participants in these dialogues often express a sense of detachment from the focus on Asia. Japan faces significant stakes in the global changes occurring, with historical and geographical factors playing a role in its relationship with China. China has surpassed Japan as the world's second-largest economy and has become the major trading partner in the region. Beijing has emphasized the South China Sea as a strategic interest and has demonstrated a more assertive demeanor. The recent incident involving the detention and release of a Chinese fishing captain in the East China Sea heightened tensions between the two countries. Some in Tokyo believe that the Chinese response to this incident, including a ban on rare earth mineral exports, was a deliberate move to assert dominance. Territorial disputes are widespread in Asia, with Japan having conflicts with Russia and South Korea, and other nations vying for control over islands in the South China Sea. Tensions between India and China persist along their Himalayan border. The lack of a structured regional security framework contributes to the volatility of these disputes. While some in Tokyo view the partnership with China as mutually beneficial, others are skeptical about the intent behind China's assertive actions. The United States remains a crucial ally for Japan, and recent events have highlighted the continued importance of the U.S.-Japan security treaty. Despite discussions of American influence waning, there is a clear desire in Tokyo to maintain the alliance. The U.S. has been invited to join the East Asia Summit, and countries such as South Korea, Vietnam, and Indonesia have shown increasing interest in strengthening ties with the United States. The United States, while experiencing a relative decline in influence, is still seen as essential for regional stability. China's assertive policies have led to a renewed interest among its neighbors in engaging with the U.S., reinforcing its strategic significance in the region."

        "title": "Mining shares lead FTSE lower, as investors worry about Chinese rate rise and Irish debt problems",
        "original_text": "Mining shares led the market lower as growing concerns about the state of the global economy prompted investors to cash in some of their recent gains. The mood was set early on as economists suggested China could be tempted to raise its interest rates to dampen down demand, following news that inflation had hit a two year high. An uninspiring G20 communiqué did little to help matters, while there were conflicting reports during the day about whether Ireland was about to receive an emergency €80bn European bail-out. The Irish government consistently denied the speculation, but it refused to die down. So by the close the FTSE 100 had fallen 18.36 points to 5796.87, although the index came off its worst levels, having dropped as low as 5711 in early trading. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said: The FTSE has done extremely well to recover from severe losses earlier in the day as investors continue to fret over the European sovereign debt crisis and concerns that emerging markets, the driving forces behind the global economy, are starting to show that their ferocious pace of growth has peaked. This week has seen the market tread water but the bias has been to the downside. With such negative news at the moment and sentiment being downbeat it's difficult for the FTSE to continue its rally. With copper down almost 2% on the Chinese news, seven of the top ten fallers in the leading index were mining groups. Antofagasta fell 40p to £14.32, Xstrata lost 38.5p to 1380.5p and Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation dropped 24p to 966p. Kazakhmys closed 53p lower at £14.98, not helped by Evolution Securities moving its recommendation from add to reduce. Analyst Louise Collinge said: While we understand that the QE2 programme in the US could keep momentum up in the copper market in the near term, we are concerned for the outlook next year if physical demand does not fill the gap which could be left when QE finishes. Longer term, we see no shortage of copper deposits in the world and the longer that copper prices stay high, the more of these projects will come on stream. Kazakhmys itself plans to develop two large projects in the coming years, as does Antofagasta, Rio Tinto, Anglo American, Xstrata, and BHP Billiton amongst others. Another big faller was software group Autonomy. Its shares have fallen by a quarter since the beginning of October when it disappointed investors by cutting its full year guidance. Today they lost another 30p to £13.89 as it emerged that the company took only 14th place in an annual American Lawyer survey of IT use in the sector. Panmure Gordon analyst George O'Connor said: While Autonomy's 14th ranking may disappoint some, as Autonomy points out, the survey is across all sizes, whereas it dominates the largest. While legal IT budgets appear to be on the mend, the survey predicts a 3.6% increase next year, so we cannot cross reference the Gartner Marketscope opinion that e-discovery spend has a 21% compound annual growth rate (2009-2014). Investors are also awaiting news of the company's latest acquisition, which had been promised for the autumn. According to Panmure, Autonomy's chief executive Mike Lynch said last week, \"the leaves are still falling.\" The broker's interpretation was that this meant a deal was still on track to meet the deadline. O'Connor said: The stock is trading at the lower end of its valuation range and we are relaxed with our buy recommendation. Still with technology, Misys lost 5.4p to 290.1p as it announced the £375m purchase of rival Sophis, as well as unveiled plans to return £670m to shareholders after the sale of most of its stake in US group Allscripts. GlaxoSmithKline slipped 6.5p to £12.23 as the US Food and Drug Administration outlined safety issues relating to lupus treatment Benlysta, which has been developed by Glaxo and US company Human Genome Sciences. The FDA report came ahead of a panel meeting next week to decide whether to approve what could be a blockbuster for the two partners. The FDA said the panel should examine whether giving the go-ahead for the drug justified the risks involved. But analyst Savvas Neophytou at Panmure Gordon said: The publication of briefing documents usually leads to share price weakness as the agency often presents the data, warts and all, to stimulate debate. If there is any weakness in the price, it may present a trading buy opportunity, as we expect an endorsement next week. But Rolls-Royce recovered 27p to 611p after it blamed a single faulty part for last week's Qantas engine explosion over Indonesia, but warned that the incident will hit its profits this year. Investec said: An update on the A380 engine failure confirms it is specific to the Trent 900 and confined to a specific component. The costs to fix will be expensed this year and will result in \"slightly lower\" operating profit, and we expect to reduce our 2010 estimated earnings per share to around 8p (a downgrade of around 3%). Clarity is a positive and we continue to believe the group has strong long term prospects and hence would look to buy on any short term weakness. And Royal Bank of Scotland recovered 0.89p to 41.91p after coming under pressure yesterday because of its exposure to Irish debt. Separately, the bank gave an upbeat investor presentation on its UK retail banking business. Positive trading statements helped electrical engineer Spectris, up 58p to £11.80, and electronics supplier Electrocomponents, 11.9p better at 259.8p.",

He stated that the market has been sideways this week with a downward bias, and continued negative news has made it difficult for the FTSE to maintain its upward trend. Copper prices fell nearly 2% following the Chinese news, with seven of the top ten decliners in the index being mining companies. Antofagasta closed at £14.32, down 40p; Xstrata was at 1380.5p, down 38.5p; and Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation closed at 966p, down 24p. Kazakhmys closed at £14.98, down 53p, following Evolution Securities' change of recommendation from 'add' to 'reduce'. Analyst Louise Collinge mentioned that while the U.S. QE2 program might support copper prices in the short term, there are concerns about demand once the program concludes. She added that long-term copper supplies are not limited, and higher prices may lead to more projects coming online. Kazakhmys, Antofagasta, Rio Tinto, Anglo American, Xstrata, and BHP Billiton are among the companies planning to develop large projects. Autonomy, a software company, was another significant decliner, with shares falling 30p to £13.89 following the release of an annual American Lawyer survey where it ranked 14th in IT use across the sector. The company's shares had dropped by a quarter since the start of October after it reduced its full-year guidance. Panmure Gordon analyst George O'Connor noted that while the 14th ranking may be disappointing, the survey included companies of all sizes, and Autonomy dominates in the larger segment. He also mentioned that although legal IT budgets are expected to grow by 3.6% next year, this does not align with the Gartner Marketscope prediction of a 21% compound annual growth rate in e-discovery spending from 2009 to 2014. Investors are also waiting for details about the company's upcoming acquisition, which was expected during the autumn. O'Connor stated that the stock is at the lower end of its valuation range and maintained a 'buy' recommendation. In the technology sector, Misys lost 5.4p to 290.1p after announcing the £375m acquisition of Sophis and plans to return £670m to shareholders following the sale of its significant stake in Allscripts. GlaxoSmithKline shares dropped 6.5p to £12.23 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration highlighted safety concerns with its lupus treatment, Benlysta, jointly developed with Human Genome Sciences. The agency will review the drug next week to evaluate if its approval is justified considering the risks. Panmure Gordon analyst Savvas Neophytou indicated that the release of briefing documents often results in share price declines as the data is presented in full to enable debate. However, he suggested that any dip might present a buying opportunity, anticipating a possible approval next week. Rolls-Royce shares increased 27p to 611p after attributing last week's Qantas engine failure over Indonesia to a single faulty part, though it warned the incident would negatively impact its profits this year. Investec confirmed that the engine failure was related to a specific part of the Trent 900 and would result in slightly lower operating profits, with an expected reduction in its 2010 earnings per share estimate by around 8p, representing a 3% downgrade. The company's transparency on the issue was noted as positive, and the broker maintained confidence in its long-term outlook. Royal Bank of Scotland shares rose 0.89p to 41.91p after experiencing pressure over its exposure to Irish debt. The bank also presented a positive outlook on its UK retail banking operations. Spectris, an electrical engineering firm, gained 58p to £11.80, and Electrocomponents, an electronics supplier, rose 11.9p to 259.8p following positive trading statements."

        "title": "Pentagon demands on Chinese military impossible, warn scholars",
        "original_text": "China's military cannot meet Washington's expectations of transparency, scholars in Beijing warned today, after a report from the US defence department said the secrecy of the People's Liberation Army was increasing the potential for \"misunderstanding and miscalculation\". The annual Pentagon report was published amid frictions between the countries over US arms sales to Taiwan, US naval drills with South Korea and China's growing confidence in the South China Seas. It argues that despite modest improvements in the PLA's openness, \"the limited transparency in China's military and security affairs enhances uncertainty and increases the potential for misunderstanding and miscalculation.\" The PLA has issued reports on its work and attempted to improve links with other militaries in recent years, engaging in more joint exercises and taking part in peacekeeping missions. But Shi Yinhong, an expert on Sino-US relations at Renmin University, said: \"Although China has steadily increased its military transparency over the past few years, it's currently impossible for China to reach the level that the US demands.\" This year China announced that the military budget would rise by 7.5% to 532.11bn yuan (£51.7bn), after two decades of double-digit annual increases. Experts suggested the slowdown reflected Chinese concerns about the way it was perceived, as well as financial constraints. China argues that spending remains well below US levels and that US capabilities remain far superior. The Pentagon believes that China's actual military spending is roughly double the stated level. Its report says China has the most active land-based ballistic and cruise missile programme in the world and that it is developing an anti-ship ballistic missile with a range of more than 1,500km, capable of attacking aircraft carriers in the western Pacific. It adds that analysts believe China will not have a domestically produced aircraft carrier and associated ships for another five years, although foreign assistance could speed that process up. It also predicts: \"It is unlikely ... that China will be able to project and sustain large forces in high-intensity combat operations far from China until well into the following decade.\" Beijing suspended military-to-military ties between the countries in January, in retaliation for US arms sales to Taiwan. The report notes that while Beijing has improved economic and cultural ties with Taiwan, it has continued the build-up of missiles opposite the island and expanded its military advantage. Last month Beiing reacted angrily when the US secretary of state waded into the territorial dispute over the South China Sea between China and several regional powers including Vietnam and the Philippines. Hillary Clinton said resolving the row was a diplomatic priority and was in the national interest of the US. Other countries complain that China is taking a tougher line on the dispute. It recently began describing rights over the strategic waterway – which is also potentially rich in natural resources – as a \"core interest\". China has also complained about US plans to hold joint drills with South Korea in the Yellow Sea, between China and the Korean peninsula. \"The United States appears to want to declare to the world: 'The Asia-Pacific and the oceans remain under the United States',\" said a commentary in the Communist party's official People's Daily newspaper. Zhu Feng, of Peking University's School of International Studies, said the combination of issues had led to an \"unprecedented surge\" in tensions but that the prospect of conflict remained low. Drew Thompson, a China expert at the Nixon Centre in Washington, warned: \"The US military and the Chinese military don't have a common understanding, a rules of the road, for navigation. That's a major cause for concern.\"",
        "debiased_text": "Scholars in Beijing stated that China's military is unable to meet Washington's expectations regarding transparency, following a report from the US Department of Defense. The report highlighted that increasing secrecy within the People's Liberation Army (PLA) may contribute to potential 'misunderstanding and miscalculation' between the two nations. The report was released amid ongoing tensions between China and the United States, including disputes over US arms sales to Taiwan, joint US naval exercises with South Korea, and developments in the South China Sea.\n\nThe report noted that while there have been modest improvements in the PLA's transparency, limitations in openness contribute to uncertainty. The PLA has released reports regarding its activities and has increased engagement in joint military exercises and peacekeeping missions. However, Shi Yinhong, an expert on Sino-US relations at Renmin University, stated that while China has increased military transparency in recent years, it is currently not feasible for China to meet the transparency levels demanded by the US.\n\nThis year, China announced a 7.5% increase in its military budget to 532.11 billion yuan (£51.7 billion), following a period of two decades of annual increases with double-digit growth. Experts suggested that the slower growth reflects concerns regarding China's international perception and financial limitations. China maintains that its military spending is still significantly lower than that of the United States and that US military capabilities are far more advanced. The Pentagon, however, estimates that China's actual military spending is around double the officially stated figure.\n\nThe report indicated that China has the most active land-based ballistic and cruise missile programme in the world and is developing an anti-ship ballistic missile with a range of more than 1,500km, which could target aircraft carriers in the western Pacific. It also noted that analysts predict China will not have a domestically produced aircraft carrier and related vessels for another five years, though foreign support could accelerate this timeline. The report further forecasts that China will not be able to project and sustain large military forces in high-intensity combat operations far from its territory until well into the next decade.\n\nIn January, Beijing suspended military-to-military relations with the United States in response to US arms sales to Taiwan. The report indicated that while Beijing has improved economic and cultural relations with Taiwan, it has continued to build up missile capabilities near the island and expanded its military superiority. Last month, Beijing expressed strong objections to remarks made by the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, concerning the territorial dispute over the South China Sea, in which China is involved with several regional powers, including Vietnam and the Philippines. Clinton emphasized resolving the dispute as a diplomatic priority for the US.\n\nOther nations have also expressed concerns about China's increased assertiveness in the South China Sea, which is a strategic waterway and potentially rich in natural resources. Recently, China has characterized its claims over the region as a 'core interest.' China has also expressed concerns about planned joint military drills between the United States and South Korea in the Yellow Sea, a body of water between China and the Korean Peninsula. A commentary in the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, remarked that the US seems to be sending a message that 'the Asia-Pacific and the oceans remain under the United States.'\n\nZhu Feng, from Peking University's School of International Studies, noted that a combination of these issues has led to a significant increase in tensions, although the likelihood of conflict remains low. Drew Thompson, a China expert at the Nixon Centre in Washington, cautioned that the lack of a shared understanding and established rules for navigation between the US and Chinese militaries represents a major source of concern."

        "title": "Washington and Beijing find new desire for co-operation",
        "original_text": "China has tried to defuse a trade row with the US over wind technology, as the two states moved towards a newly co-operative stance on a range of issues before a summit in Washington. Officials in Beijing said they were willing to discuss incentives for turbine manufacturers, which the Obama administration described as \"illegal subsidies\" in a request for talks on the subject at the World Trade Organisation. The US claims China has given an unfair advantage to domestic companies by channelling hundreds of millions of dollars to them through a special fund established in 2008. The United Steelworkers union is frustrated that this weakens the competitiveness of US firms such as General Electric in a Chinese market that has doubled in size almost every year since 2005 and is now the biggest in the world in terms of generating capacity. Beijing insists its wind policies are good for the global environment and within trade rules, but was conciliatory. \"China will conscientiously study the US request for consultations, and will deal with this in accordance with WTO dispute settlement rules, while retaining our corresponding rights,\" the Chinese commerce ministry said. Government advisers were, however, scathing. Professor Pan Jiahua, of the sustainable development research centre at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the symbolic impact is significant. \"At a global level, the US action is terrible. This gives a very bad signal for the world. It says renewable energy technologies should not be encouraged.\" Despite this spat, the US and China closed the year on a positive note on many fronts – including trade, military ties, climate change and global security – as they prepared for their presidents' second summit on 19 January. Obama visited China in November 2009. After a tense year during which US officials, including Barack Obama, openly criticised China, and their Chinese counterparts returned the favour, there was a sudden switch in tone from the US. Instead of portraying China as protectionist or as an \"enabler\" of North Korea's provocations, US officials were praising China, referring to it again as a responsible partner. In part, the improved tone reflects Washington's success in leveraging Beijing's desire for a smooth summit to get concessions from China or nudge it toward policies closer to Washington's liking. That said, significant problems bedevil the relationship between the world's sole superpower and a surging counterpart that is both partner and rival. \"You've got leaders in the US and in China that want to do everything possible to limit direct confrontation,\" said Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm, \"but structurally, both countries are going to have a hard time avoiding it.\" Administration officials commended China for soft-pedaling a proposal to hold emergency talks among South and North Korea, China, Russia, Japan and the US as part of a way to calm the tension in the region. Instead, the officials said China had accepted a US plan that put improving ties between the South and the North ahead of any multilateral talks on the North's nuclear weapons programme. President Hu Jintao plans to highlight the positive aspects of China's ties with the US. Among other summit events, he is expected to visit a Chinese-owned car parts plant and a joint US-China clean-energy project. China is also considering a request to hold a joint news conference with Obama, something Hu rarely does. All year, US and Chinese officials have bickered over economic issues, specifically access to China's markets and China's unwillingness to allow the yuan to appreciate against the dollar. But again the tone has shifted. When the US-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade wrapped up a meeting in Washington on 15 December, US officials hailed China's co-operation. China said it would open new technology and agriculture markets for US products and would toughen enforcement of intellectual property and software piracy laws. There's been another U-turn on military relations. China froze those ties in January, after the administration announced plans to sell Taiwan $6.4bn in weapons. Throughout the year, Chinese officers criticised the US. But on 13 December under-secretary of defence Michele Flournoy met General Ma Xiaotian, deputy chief of the general staff of the People's Liberation Army, and Flournoy was full of praise for her Chinese counterpart. She said that shegave Ma and his entourage the same briefings on the US nuclear, ballistic missile and space postures \"that we gave our closest allies\".",
        "debiased_text": "China and the United States have engaged in discussions regarding trade issues related to wind technology, as the two countries have shown a more cooperative approach on various matters ahead of a planned summit in Washington.

The US has argued that these subsidies provide an unfair advantage to domestic firms by channeling hundreds of millions of dollars to Chinese companies via a special fund established in 2008. The United Steelworkers union has expressed concern that such practices affect the competitiveness of US firms, including General Electric, in the Chinese market, which has grown significantly since 2005 and is now the world's largest in terms of generating capacity. Chinese officials have maintained that their wind energy policies align with trade rules and promote environmental benefit, and have stated that they will thoroughly review the US request for consultations and address the matter in accordance with WTO dispute settlement procedures, while maintaining their corresponding rights. However, some government experts have offered critical perspectives. Professor Pan Jiahua of the sustainable development research centre at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences suggested that the US action carries significant symbolic weight, noting that it could imply to the global community that encouraging renewable energy technologies is not advisable. Despite this disagreement, the two countries have made progress in several areas, including trade, military relations, climate change, and global security, as they prepared for the second summit between their leaders, scheduled for 19 January. In November 2009, President Obama visited China. After a year marked by open criticism from both sides, the US shifted its tone, expressing praise for China and referring to it once again as a responsible partner. This shift, in part, reflects efforts by Washington to secure concessions from Beijing or influence its policies in a manner more aligned with US interests, using the desire for a smooth summit as leverage. Nonetheless, challenges remain in the relationship between the two nations, which is both a partner and a rival. Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group noted that while leaders on both sides aim to avoid direct confrontation, structural issues may make such avoidance difficult. Administration officials expressed approval of China's decision to avoid pushing for emergency talks among South Korea, North Korea, China, Russia, Japan, and the US regarding regional tensions. Instead, China accepted a US proposal to first focus on improving ties between South and North Korea before engaging in multilateral discussions on the North's nuclear weapons programme. During the summit, President Hu Jintao is anticipated to emphasize the positive developments in US-China relations. Other scheduled events include a visit to a Chinese-owned car parts plant and a joint US-China clean-energy project. Hu is also reportedly considering a joint news conference with Obama, an event he typically does not participate in. Throughout the year, US and Chinese officials have had disagreements over economic matters, particularly concerning access to Chinese markets and the yuan's exchange rate relative to the dollar. However, the tone of these discussions has changed. Following the conclusion of the US-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade meeting in Washington on 15 December, US officials praised China's cooperation. China announced plans to open new technology and agriculture markets to US products and to enhance enforcement of laws against intellectual property and software piracy. There has also been a change in the military relationship between the two nations. Initially, China suspended military ties in January in response to the US's decision to sell $6.4bn in weapons to Taiwan. Throughout the year, Chinese officials expressed criticism of the US. However, on 13 December, Under-Secretary of Defence Michele Flournoy met with General Ma Xiaotian, deputy chief of the general staff of the People's Liberation Army.

        "original_text": "Rolls-Royce delivered a boost to David Cameron's trade mission to China by announcing a £750m deal to supply and service jet engines for a Chinese airline. The British engineering firm has also been contracted to reduce the carbon emissions of China Eastern Airlines, by 190,000 tonnes in the first year of a fuel management service. The airline has a fleet of more than 300 aircraft. The companies signed a memorandum of understanding in Beijing for the largest order secured so far during the prime minister's visit to China. The news is welcome relief for Rolls-Royce whose shares fell 10% after a Qantas airliner made an emergency landing in Singapore last week following the mid-air explosion of a Trent 900 engine. Qantas has grounded all its Airbus A380 superjumbo planes powered by the Rolls-Royce engines while the incident is investigated. Until the Rolls-Royce deal, signed in Cameron's presence in the Great Hall of the People, the government could only account for a string of modest deals with British firms, including measures to boost Scotch whisky sales and allow imports of breeding pigs into China. Rolls-Royce, whose shares were up nearly 2% on the news, will supply and service Trent 700 engines for 16 newly-ordered Airbus A330 aircraft. It will also provide enhanced performance kits to upgrade the Trent 700s on China Eastern Airlines's 20 existing A330s. The deal follows the $14bn (£10bn) order for the 16 Airbus planes, signed in Paris last week, which could earn British firms $5bn. Rolls-Royce has an order book nearing £60bn but will be cheered by the extra orders from the Chinese airline. Like many UK companies, Rolls-Royce plans to expand in China and sell high-value services to the country's 1.3 billion population. Liu Shaoyong, the chair of China Eastern Airlines, said: \"We have found the Trent 700 to be extremely effective in service and are pleased to select it for our latest aircraft. \"We also look forward to working with Rolls-Royce through our carbon partnership, which, we anticipate, will reduce fuel consumption by at least 2% in its first year alone, the equivalent of a 190,000-tonne reduction in CO2, which equates to the amount of CO2 produced by 80,000 cars over the same period.\" Cameron, who is is accompanied by four senior ministers and more than 40 business leaders, said: \"We want a stronger economic and business relationship with China – we are the fifth-largest economy in the world, but we have only 2% of China's imports.\"",

        "original_text": "Hillary Clinton today called on Beijing to hold a thorough and open investigation into the hacking of human rights activists' email accounts. The US secretary of state's comments, made in a speech, marked an apparent shift away from Washington's reluctance to challenge China on a number of issues in recent years. Clinton voiced unusual – if cautious – criticism of China over its internet censorship, throwing her weight behind Google's threat to withdraw from the country over the hacking and also being forced to censor its search engine. \"In an interconnected world, an attack on one nation's networks can be an attack on all,\" she said. \"Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and international condemnation. \"By reinforcing that message, we can create norms of behaviour among states and encourage respect for the global networked commons.\" Clinton likened online censorship by countries such as China, Vietnam and Iran to the rise of communist Europe, warning that a new \"information curtain\" threatened to descend on the world unless action to protect internet freedoms was taken. Her comments, which mark the Obama adminstration's first major foray into foreign policy online, come at a delicate time for relations between the US and China. Last week, Google said it was \"no longer willing to continue censoring\" Chinese users' search results for subjects such as the Tiananmen Square massacre following what it called \"a highly sophisticated and targeted attack\", originating in China, against the Gmail accounts of human rights activists and others. Clinton called on Beijing to complete a transparent investigation of the breaches, which were apparently used to try to collect data on critics of the Chinese government. \"We look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough investigation of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make this announcement. \"We also look for that investigation and its results to be transparent,\" she said. She backed Google's threat to pull out of China unless Beijing permitted it to \"operate an unfiltered search engine\". \"For companies, this issue is about more than claiming the moral high ground – it comes down to the trust between firms and their customers,\" she said. \"Consumers everywhere want to have confidence that the internet companies they rely on will provide comprehensive search results and act as responsible stewards of their information.\" China's vice-foreign minister, He Yafei, responded by saying that the hacking investigation should not be a matter for international diplomacy. \"The Google case should not be linked with relations between the two governments and countries; otherwise, it's an over-interpretation,\" he added. Despite China's attempts to dismiss the issue as domestic matter, Kurt Campbell, a US assistant secretary of state for East Asia, today revealed the two countries have had discussions about what he called \"serious concerns\" over the hacking of Google and said Washington was pressing China for an explanation. \"We have had a number of interactions with Chinese authorities about the Google matter,\" he added. \"We are going to have more of those in the coming days.\" In the speech, delivered in Washington, Clinton promised $15m (£9.2m) in funding for grassroots efforts to \"expand civic participation and increase the new media capabilities of civil society in the Middle East and North Africa\". However, some analysts suggested the language used betrayed a lack of clear thinking and insight into the way in which repressive governments use technology. \"The references to the Berlin Wall and the information iron curtain show how the state department is still mired in a cold war mentality,\" Evgeny Morozov, an expert on political repression online, said. \"It shows that they are very naive in how they think about modern authoritarian regimes.\" US officials have been working to come up with new ways of encouraging dissidents. Last year, they encouraged the online messaging service Twitter to stay online as a way of helping spread news of anti-government protests in Iran. Officials also recently held talks with the Russian military over a new treaty intended to help quell the rise of cyber attacks.",
        "debiased_text": "Hillary Clinton today urged Beijing to conduct a comprehensive and open investigation into the hacking of human rights activists' email accounts. The remarks, delivered in a speech, indicated a change in the United States' approach to engaging China on several issues. Clinton expressed a rare, though measured, criticism of China regarding its internet censorship, supporting Google's statement about its potential withdrawal from the country due to the hacking and the requirement to censor search results. She stated, 'In an interconnected world, an attack on one nation's networks can be an attack on all,' and emphasized that entities or individuals involved in cyber attacks should be held accountable and face international disapproval. She suggested that by reinforcing this message, norms of behavior among states could be established, promoting respect for the global networked environment. Clinton compared internet censorship practices in countries such as China, Vietnam, and Iran to the rise of communist Europe, cautioning that a new 'information curtain' could jeopardize internet freedoms worldwide if no action were taken. Her comments represent the first significant intervention by the Obama administration in foreign policy concerning internet-related issues. Google announced last week that it was 'no longer willing to continue censoring' Chinese users' search results on topics such as the Tiananmen Square massacre, following what it described as a sophisticated, targeted cyber attack originating from China aimed at Gmail accounts of human rights advocates and others. Clinton requested that Chinese authorities complete a transparent investigation into the breaches, which were allegedly aimed at collecting data on government critics. She said, 'We look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough investigation of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make this announcement.

        "original_text": "TIANJIN, China -- Toyota Motor Corp. suspended production at an assembly plant in China on Friday because of a strike at a supplier factory, as the impact of labor unrest escalates for the world's largest auto maker in the biggest car market. Hitoshi Yokoyama, a Beijing-based Toyota spokesman, said a shortage of certain plastic interior parts from the supplier plant, where workers have been striking since Thursday, began curtailing production at Toyota's car plant in Tianjin Thursday night. By Friday afternoon, all three assembly lines were idled. Toyota doesn't know how long the shutdown will last but is doing its best to resume work, Mr. Yokoyama said. The Tianjin plant, which makes Corolla, Rav4 and other models and has capacity to produce 400,000 cars a year, is one of Toyota's largest in China. It has assembly plants in three other Chinese cities. The worker unrest at the Toyota supplier plant is part of a wave of labor action across China in recent weeks that also has hit Honda Motor Co. Honda resolved strikes at two supplier plants that temporarily halted production of vehicles. Any prolonged disruption could sting Toyota in a market where it is lagging behind rivals. Its sales in China last year grew 21% to 700,900 vehicles, even as China's total sales surged about 50% to 13 million vehicles. Toyota's problems in Tianjin stem from a strike at Tianjin Toyoda Gosei Co., a joint venture part-owned by Japan's Toyoda Gosei Co., which is 42%-owned by Toyota. Tianjin Toyoda Gosei has two facilities near each other that employ 1,700 workers. About 40 workers at one of the Tianjin Toyoda Gosei plants began striking Thursday, with more joining later in the day. By Friday afternoon, that plant appeared to be empty, with no activity visible. Workers were present at the other facility, although they said that production there had been temporarily halted earlier Friday. Workers said a large number of police showed up at the Tianjin Toyoda Gosei plant Thursday night. Two workers said that police beat some striking workers and that several workers had to go to the hospital. An officer with the Tianjin public-security department confirmed that policemen had been sent to Tianjin Toyoda Gosei Thursday to \"keep order.\" He declined to say whether any workers were hit or detained. --- Gao Sen and Kersten Zhang contributed to this article.",

The Tianjin plant, which produces models such as the Corolla and Rav4 and has an annual production capacity of 400,000 vehicles, is one of Toyota's largest facilities in China. Toyota also operates assembly plants in three other Chinese cities. The labor unrest at the supplier plant is part of a broader wave of strikes in China in recent weeks, which has also affected Honda Motor Co. Honda has resolved strikes at two of its supplier plants, which had temporarily halted vehicle production. Prolonged disruptions could impact Toyota in a market where it is currently trailing behind competitors. Toyota's sales in China last year increased by 21% to 700,900 vehicles, while China's total vehicle sales rose approximately 50% to 13 million vehicles. The strike at the Tianjin Toyoda Gosei Co., a joint venture partially owned by Japan's Toyoda Gosei Co., which holds a 42% stake in the company, is the source of Toyota's production issues in Tianjin. The plant has two facilities located near each other, employing a total of 1,700 workers. Around 40 workers at one of the facilities began striking on Thursday, with more joining later in the day. By Friday afternoon, that plant appeared to be unoccupied with no visible activity. Workers were present at the other facility, though production there had been temporarily halted earlier on Friday. According to reports, a significant number of police officers arrived at the Tianjin Toyoda Gosei plant on Thursday night. Two workers claimed that police had beaten some striking individuals, resulting in several requiring hospital treatment. An official from the Tianjin public-security department confirmed that police were deployed to the site to 'keep order,' but did not provide information on whether any workers were injured or detained."

        "title": "American catfish industry launches ad campaign to curb Chinese imports",
        "original_text": "The simmering trade war between the US and China has shifted to the catfish industry, as American farmers claim that cheap, substandard catfish imported from China is undermining their $4bn domestic business. The battle over the bottom-feeding fish is giving lobbyists a new populist front in the campaign to cap trade surpluses with China. Two groups, Catfish Farmers of America (CFA) and the Catfish Institute, are claiming that Chinese and Vietnamese catfish fillets are tainted with pollutants and antibiotics. The institute is calling for country of origin labels on catfish, and the farmers' body wants the Obama administration to inspect all imports. With 13,000 direct employees and $4bn (£2.6bn) in annual revenues, the industry has muscle to take its grievances to the airwaves. A commercial running on the CNN and Fox television networks asks provocatively: \"Did you know that only 2% of imported seafood is inspected?\" and concludes: \"Make your family's health and safety your number-one concern.\" A second ad shows a man disguised as a Chinese catfish making kung-fu moves on unsuspecting housewives and knocking over a dinner table. \"The White House has had more than two years to enforce a law that could provide important food safety protections for American consumers,\" Joey Lowery, president of the CFA, said. US catfish farmers may be able to count on residual public sympathy extended to shrimp farmers in the Gulf of Mexico affected by the BP oil spill. But its aggressive tactics may end up backfiring, warns the industry journal Seafood Source. It said of the CFA's ads: \"[A] faux food safety scare is the crown jewel in a manipulative operation filled with destructive tactics that will cause collateral damage to many parts of the seafood community.\" The catfish industry, centred in Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana and Alabama, claims it has hit hard times largely because of cheaper Asian fish flooding the market. Critics say safety claims against Chinese imports are nothing less than manipulative. A seafood industry trade body, the National Fisheries Institute (NFI), described the TV commercials as \"filled with half-truths and hypocrisy\". The NFI president, John Connelly, said: \"Claiming this is anything other than a trade issue is laughable.\" The regulation of seafood imports is regarded as one of the most effective public safety systems in the US, SeafoodSource notes. It adds: \"So, CFA members can't make ends meet but they can scrape together hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce and air TV spots that bash imports?\"",

        "title": "U.S. to Press China Harder --- Beijing's Weak Currency Remains Top Issue; Treasury Report on Yuan Due Friday; U.S. to Press China Harder --- Beijing's Weak Currency Remains Top Issue; Treasury Report on Yuan Due Friday",
        "original_text": "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. will try to intensify pressure further on China over its exchange-rate policy after a weekend meeting of the International Monetary Fund failed to produce an agreement on global currency movements. A U.S. official said the Obama administration was pleased that it was able to put China's currency policies at the center of discussions at the IMF's annual meeting, and felt that Beijing was responding to U.S. efforts by lifting the value of the yuan at an accelerated pace over the past month. But the official said continued pressure was needed to prevent China from backsliding. The U.S., European nations and a number of emerging markets complain that China is deliberately undervaluing its yuan to aid its exporters. To compete, Japan, South Korea, Brazil and others have taken measures to beat down the value of their currencies as well, leading to fears these efforts may presage a trade war. Chinese officials took a much more visible role at the IMF meetings than they usually do, making their case in press conferences, speeches and public seminars. They sought to ease tensions, but were careful not to go beyond Beijing's policy that a \"gradual\" ascent in the yuan was to be expected -- though they didn't define gradual. On Sunday, China's central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan said if China can keep inflation low and the economy stable, \"then the currency would become stronger and stronger.\" But he warned not to expect immediate changes, comparing the policy to a Chinese doctor putting together a package of 10 herbs to cure an illness. \"It solves the problem not overnight, but in a month or two months,\" he said to laughs at a meeting of the Institute of International Finance, a bankers' trade association. The U.S will focus its attention on a summit of the leaders of the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations in Seoul in November. The Obama administration is betting China will make a further move on its currency before then, as a way to keep its exchange-rate policies from dominating the meeting -- and South Korean negotiators are scrambling to convince Beijing to do just that. Shortly before the last G-20 summit in Toronto in June, Beijing agreed to show \"flexibility\" in its exchange-rate policy, ending a two-year period of tightly tying the yuan to the dollar. However, China barely budged its currency upward, producing yet another round of U.S. pressure, including a Sept. 6 visit to Beijing by White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers. Since then, the value of the yuan has gained about 2% against the dollar, a pace the U.S. official said was encouraging, though the U.S. wants further movement. \"It is critical to see more progress by the major emerging economies to more flexible, more market-oriented exchange-rate management,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said at an IMF session Saturday, in remarks clearly aimed at China. The U.S. has other levers too, but it is wary of pushing some of them. Most prominent is a semiannual report that Treasury is required to release by Friday examining whether exchange rates -- including China's -- are being \"manipulated.\" Mr. Geithner has testified in Congress that a manipulation finding on China's yuan could be counterproductive. Such a finding, under a 1988 trade law, simply requires the U.S. to negotiate with Beijing, which it already is doing, and could open U.S. companies to retaliation from Beijing. In April, Treasury delayed the report, giving China more time to change its policy, and then gave China a passing grade after it said it would allow more flexibility. Still, giving China a pass in the upcoming report could cause political problems for the administration at a time when China has become a potent political issue in fall campaigns. That argues for Treasury delaying the release of its finding, as it has done in the past under Democratic and Republican administrations. Mr. Geithner has told lawmakers he'll file in a \"timely\" manner, without a more specific commitment. Two proposals the U.S. took into the IMF meeting got no traction. In a talk in advance of the meeting, Mr. Geithner suggested that China might be willing to boost its currency if other Asian currencies did the same, in a kind of regional accord. That way, none of the countries would gain a competitive edge. But during a seminar at the IMF, Yi Gang, deputy governor of China's central bank, called such a deal \"very unlikely.\" Mr. Geithner also said that China's power and role at the IMF should be linked to its willingness to move its currency. That won the backing of IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, but few others. \"Nobody is linking this,\" said Egyptian Finance Minister Youssef Boutros-Ghali, who chairs the IMF's policymaking committee and is overseeing a revamping of the organization's voting structure. While European nations expressed concern about the yuan's value, they were less confrontational with Beijing. Some argued it's up to the U.S. and China to address the root causes of the dispute over currencies. \"The U.S. would have to reduce the internal and external deficits that they have. From the Chinese side, the most important aspect would be to increase internal consumption, and an appreciation [of their currency rate] would be one of the instruments,\" Ewald Nowotny, head of Austria's central bank, said in an interview. Olli Rehn, the European Commission's head of economic and monetary affairs, said he considered the yuan \"significantly undervalued\" and called on the IMF to take an \"enhanced role\" in solving the dispute. Mr. Strauss-Kahn on Friday suggested an initiative in which the IMF would work on a number of fronts to ease currency battles. But by the end of the IMF meeting on Saturday, he described a narrower effort where the IMF would focus its reviews of country policies more heavily on currency issues. That leaves the U.S. with a combination of unilateral and multilateral levers to pull. Unilateral moves can be difficult because of domestic politics. Mr. Geithner and the White House have tried to use Congressional ire to convince China of the depth of U.S. concern. They point to a bill that passed the House last month that would make easier for domestic industries to win cases against China based on the argument that Beijing's restraint of its currency subsidizes its exports. But the Treasury also worries that such a bill could backfire by provoking a trade war. So it hasn't endorsed the bill -- or given lawmakers advice about what kind of provisions it wants. Senate leaders say they don't think there is time to pass a similar bill and have it signed into law during a lame-duck session after the November elections. But that could change if anti-Chinese sentiment grows in the Congress. The Treasury sees the Korea G-20 summit as more promising. Currency is on the agenda as part of what the G-20 calls its \"rebalancing\" process. Trade-surplus countries -- especially China -- have agreed to shift away from export-led growth to domestic consumption, which implies an appreciation of the yuan. Trade deficit countries -- especially the U.S. -- have agreed to boost savings and reduce imports. The overall goal is reduced reliance on U.S. consumer spending for global growth. South Korean negotiators are talking to Beijing about the importance of striking a political deal with the U.S. over currency issues before the summit, where President Barack Obama is sure to press Chinese President Hu Jintao. Mr. Zhou, the central banker, said China agrees with the G-20 agenda. Enlarge this image.",
        "debiased_text": "WASHINGTON -- Following a weekend meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which did not result in an agreement on global currency movements, the United States indicated its intention to maintain pressure on China regarding its exchange-rate policy. A U.S. official stated that the Obama administration successfully emphasized China's currency policies during the IMF's annual meeting. The official noted that China had increased the value of the yuan at an accelerated pace over the past month, a response to U.S. efforts. However, continued pressure was considered necessary to ensure China does not revert to previous policies. The United States, along with several European nations and emerging markets, has expressed concerns that China is maintaining a deliberately undervalued yuan to support its exporters. In response, countries like Japan, South Korea, and Brazil have also taken steps to influence the value of their currencies, raising concerns about the potential for a trade war. Chinese officials participated more visibly in the IMF meetings compared to usual, engaging in press conferences, speeches, and public seminars to address concerns. They emphasized that the yuan's appreciation would be gradual, though they did not provide a specific timeline. On Sunday, Zhou Xiaochuan, China's central bank governor, stated that maintaining low inflation and economic stability would lead to a stronger currency but warned that changes would not be immediate. He used an analogy of a Chinese doctor's multi-herb treatment to illustrate that the solution would take some time. The U.S. plans to concentrate its efforts on the upcoming G-20 summit in Seoul, scheduled for November, with the hope that China will make further adjustments to its currency before the meeting. South Korean negotiators are also working to encourage Beijing to make such adjustments. During the last G-20 summit in Toronto in June, China agreed to demonstrate greater flexibility with its exchange-rate policy, ending a two-year period of strict alignment with the dollar. However, the yuan's increase was minimal, prompting further U.S. pressure, including a visit by White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers to Beijing on September 6. Since that time, the yuan has increased approximately 2% against the dollar, a rate described by the U.S. official as encouraging, though further change is desired. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner emphasized the importance of increased progress by major emerging economies in adopting more flexible and market-oriented exchange-rate management in an IMF session on Saturday. The U.S. also has other tools available, such as a semiannual report by the Treasury on whether exchange rates are being manipulated, including China's. Geithner has warned that finding manipulation in China's yuan could be counterproductive under the 1988 trade law, as it would only necessitate negotiations and risk potential retaliation. In April, the Treasury delayed the report to provide China more time to adjust. After China claimed to be allowing more flexibility, the Treasury gave it a passing grade. Nonetheless, granting China a pass in the upcoming report could create political challenges for the administration, particularly as China has become a significant political topic in the upcoming elections. Geithner has not committed to a specific timeline for the release of the finding, only stating that it would be done in a 'timely' manner. Two U.S. proposals aimed at the IMF meeting did not gain support. Geithner previously suggested China might increase its currency if other Asian countries did the same as part of a potential regional agreement. However, Yi Gang, deputy governor of China's central bank, stated that such an agreement is 'very unlikely.' Geithner also suggested that China's influence within the IMF could be contingent upon its willingness to adjust its currency, an idea supported by IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, but not widely accepted by others. Egyptian Finance Minister Youssef Boutros-Ghali, who chairs the IMF's policymaking committee, stated that linking China's role to currency actions was not a common approach. While European nations shared concerns about the yuan's value, their approach was less confrontational than that of the United States. Some European officials suggested that the U.S. and China should address the underlying issues in their currency dispute. Ewald Nowotny, head of Austria's central bank, stated in an interview that the U.S. should focus on reducing internal and external deficits, while China should increase internal consumption, with currency appreciation being one of the instruments. Olli Rehn, the European Commission's head of economic and monetary affairs, stated that he believes the yuan is 'significantly undervalued' and encouraged the IMF to take an 'enhanced role' in resolving the issue. Strauss-Kahn proposed an initiative for the IMF to address currency issues from multiple angles, but by the meeting's conclusion on Saturday, the focus had narrowed to more intensive reviews of national policies related to currency. The U.S. has a range of unilateral and multilateral tools at its disposal. Unilateral actions may be challenging due to domestic political considerations. Geithner and the White House have attempted to increase the pressure on China using congressional concern, referencing a recently passed House bill that would facilitate domestic industries' cases against China, arguing that the U.S. believes China's currency management subsidizes their exports. However, the Treasury has not supported the bill and has not provided lawmakers with specific guidance. Senate leaders believe there is not enough time to pass a similar bill and have it signed into law during the lame-duck session following the November elections. This opinion could change if anti-Chinese sentiment increases within Congress. The Treasury views the G-20 summit in Seoul as a more favorable setting for addressing the issue, as currency management is part of the G-20's 'rebalancing' agenda. Under this agenda, trade-surplus countries have committed to reducing their reliance on export-led growth and increasing domestic consumption, which implies an appreciation of their currencies. Trade-deficit countries, including the U.S., have agreed to enhance savings and reduce imports. The overarching goal is to decrease the global dependency on U.S. consumer demand. South Korean negotiators have been engaged with Chinese officials, emphasizing the significance of a political resolution with the U.S. over currency issues prior to the summit, where President Barack Obama is expected to raise the matter with Chinese President Hu Jintao. Zhou Xiaochuan, the central bank governor, noted that China supports the G-20 agenda."

        "original_text": "China's visceral response to the US$39-billion BHP Billiton bid for Potash Corp.-- talk abounds of a possible Chinese white knight -- shows it fears a concentration of pricing power in the big miner more than the current Russian-Canadian marketing cartel.\nIt must seem like deja vu to China after it struggled to stop BHP gaining control of Rio Tinto and almost half its supply of imported iron ore, then got into a bruising battle with the company over the pricing of the steel-making raw material.\nThough BHP is likely to ditch the cartel for a market-based pricing system if its hostile bid for the Canadian fertilizer producer is successful, some China-based buyers worry the changes will be to their detriment.\n\"As one of the biggest importers of potash, China does not want to see more concentration in this market. The same could apply to India, which relies on imports for 100% of its potash consumption,\" said Emilien Mazo, an analyst with Louis Dreyfus Commodities.\nThese two countries may have good reasons to worry about such a deal, he said.\nPotash buyers currently face a duopoly dominated by two companies; Canpotex, an export organization owned by Potash and two smaller producers, Agrium Inc. and Mosaic Co.; and Belarusion Potash Co., which sells material produced in Russia and Belarus.\nCollectively, Canpotex and BPC control 70% of global potash exports, in the same way Brazil's Vale and BHP and Rio control around two-thirds of the seaborne iron ore business.\n\"If BHP, which is infamous for monopoly, buys Potash Corp., it will make the pricing system worse for consumers,\" an official with a Chinese compound fertilizer maker said.\nHe added his company would also not be happy if China's Sinochem bought Potash, as the state-owned company was involved throughout the entire industry chain and therefore a competitor.\nChinese government officials were not available for comment.\nAn official at the China Inorganic Salts Industry Association, a nongovernment group covering the potash fertilizer industry, said the association could not comment on the issue until industry representatives met to agree on their position.\n\"The potash market is a little like iron ore. The Chinese want bargaining power. In a free market they worry their influence will be diluted versus the situation now where they and one or two others set the price from the buyers' side,\" a Shanghai-based commodities trader said.\n\"You also have to remember that from the Chinese perspective, they have had a difficult experience with BHP over the years -- the shift in iron ore pricing and the loss of price participation in copper concentrate deals,\" he added.\nThe split with tradition was rancorous, heightened by the conviction of a number of Rio Tinto's iron ore team in China for industrial espionage.\nChinese buyers, under the auspices of the China Iron and Steel Association, finally acquiesced earlier this year, effectively ending benchmark pricing in the key steel making raw material.\nBut the breakup of the Canadian-Russian potash cartel and market pricing may win favour with other buyers and with regulators.\n\"We think it would be a good thing if BHP went to market pricing,\" said Ian Ballantyne, chief executive of Canegrowers Association of Australia, whose members use more potash than any other fertilizer.\n\"We have seen an escalation in the price of fertilizers, particularly potash, brought about for no other reason than there is a cartel in place,\" Mr. Ballantyne said. \"Fertilizer demand and fertilizer supply has been in our view manipulated by a range of parties for some time.\"",
        "debiased_text": "China's reaction to the US$39-billion BHP Billiton bid for Potash Corp. has led to speculation about the possibility of a Chinese white knight intervening. This response appears to stem from concerns over the increased concentration of pricing power in the hands of a major mining company, rather than the existing Russian-Canadian marketing cartel.\n\nChina has previously faced similar situations when attempting to prevent BHP from acquiring control of Rio Tinto and almost half of its imported iron ore supply. This led to a significant negotiation over the pricing of the steel-making raw material.\n\nIf BHP succeeds in its hostile bid for the Canadian fertilizer producer, it is likely to move away from the cartel system to a market-based pricing model. However, some buyers in China are concerned that this transition might be disadvantageous to them.\n\nEmilien Mazo, an analyst with Louis Dreyfus Commodities, noted that as one of the largest importers of potash, China does not want to see further market concentration. The same concern may apply to India, which relies entirely on imports for its potash needs. He stated that these two countries may have valid concerns regarding the proposed deal.\n\nCurrently, potash buyers are facing a duopoly led by Canpotex, an export organization that includes Potash Corp., Agrium Inc., and Mosaic Co., and Belarusion Potash Co., which supplies potash from Russia and Belarus. Together, these entities account for approximately 70% of global potash exports, similar to the control that Brazil's Vale, BHP, and Rio Tinto have over about two-thirds of the seaborne iron ore market.\n\nA representative from a Chinese compound fertilizer maker stated that if BHP acquires Potash Corp., the resulting pricing system might be more unfavorable for consumers. Additionally, the representative mentioned that the company would not be pleased if China's Sinochem were to acquire Potash, as Sinochem operates across the entire industry chain and would be a direct competitor.\n\nChinese government officials were not available for comment on the situation. An official from the China Inorganic Salts Industry Association, a non-governmental organization covering the potash fertilizer industry, indicated that the association could not provide a comment until industry representatives had reached a consensus on their stance.\n\nA commodities trader based in Shanghai noted that the potash market is comparable to the iron ore market, in which Chinese buyers seek to maintain bargaining power. The trader also pointed out that in a free market, China worries its influence may be reduced compared to the current scenario in which they and a few others set prices from the buyers' perspective. He further mentioned that from China's perspective, it has had challenging experiences with BHP over the years, including shifts in iron ore pricing and the loss of price participation in copper concentrate deals.\n\nThe change in pricing structure for iron ore was difficult, exacerbated by the conviction of several members of Rio Tinto's iron ore team in China on charges of industrial espionage. Chinese buyers, under the guidance of the China Iron and Steel Association, eventually accepted this change earlier this year, effectively ending benchmark pricing in the key steel-making raw material.\n\nThe breakup of the Canadian-Russian potash cartel and the transition to market pricing may be welcomed by other buyers and regulators. Ian Ballantyne, chief executive of the Canegrowers Association of Australia, stated that he believes it would be beneficial for BHP to adopt market pricing for potash. He added that the increase in fertilizer prices, especially potash, has been attributed to the existence of a cartel. Mr. Ballantyne suggested that fertilizer demand and supply have, in his view, been influenced by various parties for an extended period."

The British engine maker said on Monday it had won the $1.8bn order to provide engines for 20 new aircraft. It follows a contract made with China Eastern Airlines this month worth $1.2bn. The deals come amid intense scrutiny of Rolls-Royce's engines. Safety concerns were raised after a Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine on a Qantas A380 superjumbo failed on November 4, shortly after take-off from Singapore. The next day a second Qantas passenger jet - this time a Boeing 747-400 jumbo - was forced to abort a flight because of problems with its Rolls-Royce engine . In the latest deal, Rolls-Royce will provide Trent XWB engines to 10 Airbus A350 XWB aircraft and Trent 700 engines to 10 Airbus A330 jets. Separately, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued a second emergency airworthiness directive late on Monday for the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines used on the A380s being flown by Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa. The order refines an earlier EASA directive issued on November 10, which required regular inspections of the engine turbine area. The new order requires a focus on \"oil service tubes\" in that area. Rolls-Royce said the new directive was consistent with the maintenance programme the company described on November 12, when it said it planned to replace \"the relevant module\", or section of the engine, according to an agreed schedule.",

This follows a $1.2 billion contract with China Eastern Airlines earlier this month. The contracts were made during a period of increased attention on Rolls-Royce engines. Safety concerns were raised after a Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine on a Qantas A380 failed on November 4, shortly after take-off from Singapore. The next day, a second Qantas passenger jet, a Boeing 747-400, had to abort a flight due to issues with its Rolls-Royce engine. In the latest agreement, Rolls-Royce will supply Trent XWB engines for 10 Airbus A350 XWB aircraft and Trent 700 engines for 10 Airbus A330 jets. Additionally, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued a second emergency airworthiness directive on Monday for Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines used on A380 aircraft operated by Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa. The directive refines an earlier one issued on November 10, which required regular inspections of the engine turbine area. The new directive emphasizes inspections of 'oil service tubes' in that area. Rolls-Royce stated that the directive aligns with the maintenance program the company outlined on November 12, when it announced plans to replace 'the relevant module' of the engine according to an established schedule."

        "original_text": "Leaning Bridge Village is less than 150km from Beijing, but might as well be light-years removed from the capital's glittering towers. Nestled below rugged hills topped by China's ancient Great Wall, Leaning Bridge is a cluster of one-story stone-and-brick farmhouses where farmers raise corn and cash crops such as chestnuts or apricots, much as their ancestors did. And it is in places like this where the success or failure of the policies of Chinese President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao will be measured. Wen himself has visited the village three times since 2000, and points to it as a concrete reminder that the cities' bright lights don't represent the real China. The two leaders came to power six years ago vowing to improve the lot of the farmers. Since then they have done much for the impoverished rural west, trimming agricultural taxes, pouring in subsidies, launching health-care cooperatives, and allowing farmers to rent out land and buildings. But their work is not done. Though Wen recently called farmers the \"lifeline\" of the economy, state-run media acknowledged in March that rural per capita net income, $758 a year, was less than a third of its urban equivalent-the worst showing since China's market reforms began in 1978. The 225 million rural-born migrant workers-one fifth of China's population-work in urban areas but are denied benefits enjoyed by city dwellers. Result: a metastasizing underclass of rural migrants living as -second-class citizens in China's cities. The divide has sparked anger among the rural poor. Antigovernment unrest is a growing concern. Many protests are by farmers victimized by corrupt local cadres or real-estate barons. Internal debate over the dangers of China's growing rural-urban divide came to a head in early March, on the eve of the annual National People's Congress, when 13 media outlets published an unusually blunt editorial calling for reform of the household registration (or hukou ) system, which denies rural-born migrant workers in urban areas the same rights that city dwellers enjoy, such as cheaper schooling and permission to live legally in cities where they work. \"We hope that decades of Chinese government maladministration can end with this generation,\" the authors wrote. Almost immediately, Beijing censors halted further discussion of the editorial. The chief author was fired by the Beijing-based Economic Observer's Web site, and others were disciplined. Wen and Hu know the well-being of China's rural population is crucial to the world's economic future. For years, China was the low-cost supplier of goods to buyers in the West, particularly in the U.S. Now with American consumers battered by the global financial crisis, China can no longer sustain its growth rate as an export factory to the world. So rather than encouraging more unskilled migrant workers to leave the farm to produce low-cost trinkets for American shoppers, China wants its poor farmers, who currently save virtually all their cash in case of illness, to become confident consumers so the country can rely more on domestic consumption and less on exports. Beijing needs to unleash the spending power of China's rural population, still more than 50 percent of its 1.3 -billion--plus people. To get there, leaders have channeled the lion's share of the $600 billion economic stimulus into largely rural areas in the west, rather than the export--manufacturing centers on the east coast. They gave manufacturers special incentives to offer farmers rebates on items such as refrigerators, air conditioners, and computers. Farmers say a rural -medical-insurance scheme, launched several years ago, is expanding and lessening farmers' paranoia about hospital bills. But the window of opportunity may be closing. In 2012 the Hu-Wen leadership is slated to transfer power to a new team. Expected to replace Hu as the top leader: Xi Jinping, who is linked to the Shanghai-faction officials who reflect fast-growth, export-oriented, urban priorities-a sharp contrast to the Hu-Wen focus on social justice. What's more, the rural-urban gap continues to widen, and Beijing's stimulus package has unleashed the specter of inflation, prompting Wen to warn that inflation, unfair income distribution, and corruption could be a formula potent enough \"to affect social stability and even the stability of state power.\" With this in mind, during his most recent visit to Leaning Bridge, in January, Wen promised villagers even greater subsidies, and assured them he would visit again after he retired to see how things have improved. Until then, China's leaders will be scrambling to deliver the goods. With Kristen Minogue in Beijing",
        "debiased_text": "Leaning Bridge Village is located less than 150 km from Beijing. The village consists of one-story stone-and-brick farmhouses, where farmers grow corn and cash crops such as chestnuts or apricots. Since 2000, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has visited the village three times, highlighting it as an example of rural life. Following their assumption of power six years ago, President Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao introduced policies aimed at improving the conditions of farmers. These policies included reducing agricultural taxes, providing subsidies, launching healthcare cooperatives, and allowing farmers to rent out land and buildings.\n\nIn March, state-run media acknowledged that rural per capita net income was $758 per year, which is less than a third of the urban per capita net income, marking the worst disparity since the initiation of China's market reforms in 1978. There are approximately 225 million rural-born migrant workers, making up one fifth of China's population, who work in urban areas but are not granted the same benefits as city residents. This has led to a growing group of rural migrants being regarded as second-class citizens in urban settings.\n\nThe divide between rural and urban areas has raised concerns regarding potential unrest. Many protests occur due to issues such as corrupt local cadres or real-estate barons. In early March, prior to the annual National People's Congress, 13 media outlets published an editorial calling for reform of the household registration (hukou) system, which restricts rural-born migrant workers from enjoying the same rights as city dwellers, including affordable schooling and legal residency in the cities where they work. The editorial expressed a hope that decades of government mismanagement could be rectified within this generation. Shortly thereafter, discussions about the editorial were restricted by Beijing censors, and the chief author was dismissed from the Economic Observer's website, with other individuals involved being reprimanded.\n\nThe wellbeing of China's rural population is considered essential for the future of the country's economy. Historically, China served as a low-cost supplier of goods to Western markets, particularly the United States. However, with American consumers being affected by the global financial crisis, China's ability to sustain its economic growth through exports is being challenged. As a result, the government is making efforts to transform rural populations into confident consumers to support domestic consumption rather than relying on exports. To this end, a significant portion of the $600 billion economic stimulus was directed toward rural areas in the west, rather than the export-manufacturing centers on the east coast. Manufacturers have been given incentives to offer rebates on consumer items such as refrigerators, air conditioners, and computers to rural residents.\n\nFarmers have indicated that a rural medical insurance program, initiated several years ago, is expanding and reducing concerns about medical expenses. However, the timeline for achieving these goals may be limited, as the leadership of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao is expected to transition in 2012 to a new team, with Xi Jinping anticipated to succeed Hu. Xi Jinping is associated with officials from the Shanghai faction, who are more focused on urban development and export-oriented policies, in contrast to the Hu-Wen emphasis on social justice.\n\nAdditionally, the gap between rural and urban areas is increasing, and the government's economic stimulus has raised concerns about inflation. Wen Jiabao has warned that inflation, unequal income distribution, and corruption could be significant factors affecting social stability and the stability of state power. During his latest visit to Leaning Bridge in January, Wen pledged increased subsidies to the villagers and assured them of a future visit after his retirement to assess the improvements made."

        "original_text": "WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is in advanced negotiations to share nuclear fuel and technology with Vietnam in a deal that would allow Hanoi to enrich its own uranium -- terms that critics on Capitol Hill say would undercut the more stringent demands the U.S. has been making of its partners in the Middle East. The State Department-led negotiations could unsettle China, which shares hundreds of miles of border with Vietnam. It is the latest example of the U.S.'s renewed assertiveness in South and Southeast Asia, as Washington strengthens ties with nations that have grown increasingly wary of Beijing's growing regional might. U.S. officials familiar with the matter say negotiators have given a full nuclear-cooperation proposal to the communist country and former Cold War foe, and have started briefing House and Senate foreign-relations committees. A top U.S. official briefed on the negotiation said China hadn't been consulted on the talks. \"It doesn't involve China,\" the official said. Some counterproliferation experts and U.S. lawmakers briefed on the talks say the deal also marks a step backward in Washington's recent nonproliferation efforts, pointing to a key proviso that would allow Hanoi to produce nuclear fuel on its own soil. Both the Obama and George W. Bush administrations had been requiring that countries interested in nuclear cooperation with the U.S. renounce the right to enrich uranium in-country for civilian purposes, a right provided to signatories of the United Nations' Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The technologies required to produce fuel for power reactors can also be used to create atomic weapons, raising proliferation fears. U.S. officials have hailed a nuclear-cooperation agreement that President Barack Obama signed last year with the United Arab Emirates as a nonproliferation model, because the Arab country agreed to purchase all of its nuclear fuel from the international market. The Obama administration is currently negotiating a nuclear pact with Jordan in which Washington is also demanding that the country commit to not developing an indigenous nuclear-fuel cycle. The senior U.S. official briefed on the Vietnam talks said the State Department is setting a different standard for Hanoi, as the Middle East is viewed as posing a greater proliferation risk than Asia. \"Given our special concerns about Iran and the genuine threat of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, we believe the U.A.E . . . . agreement is a model for the region,\" said the U.S. official. \"These same concerns do not specifically apply in Asia. We will take different approaches region by region and country by country.\" Vuong Huu Tan, director of the Vietnam Atomic Energy Institute, a government office, said Vietnamese and U.S. officials reached an initial agreement on nuclear cooperation in March and hope to finalize the pact later this year. He said Vietnam didn't plan to enrich uranium, \"as it is sensitive to Vietnam to do so.\" Congressional staff and nonproliferation experts briefed on the negotiations have been quick to say the position is a rollback of a key Obama administration nonproliferation platform. They also say Washington's position exposes it to criticism from Arab and developing countries that the U.S. is employing a double standard in pursuing its nuclear policies. This could cause Jordan, Saudi Arabia and other nations currently pursuing cooperation agreements with Washington to balk at accepting the same tough terms as the U.A.E. \"It's ironic . . . as nonproliferation is one of the president's top goals that the U.A.E. model is not being endorsed here,\" said a senior Arab official whose government is pursuing nuclear power. \"People will start to see a double standard, and it will be a difficult policy to defend in the future.\" Nonproliferation experts also challenge the State Department's argument that Asia poses any less of a proliferation threat than the Middle East. They note that North Korea has actively been spreading dual-use technologies to countries such as Myanmar in recent years. Japan is believed to have the technologies to quickly assemble nuclear weapons if the political decision were made. Vietnam signed an initial memorandum of understanding with the Bush administration in 2001 to pursue cooperation with the U.S. on securing fissile materials and developing civilian nuclear power. The Obama administration has accelerated talks with Hanoi in recent months aimed at completing a deal to allow for the exchange of know-how and cooperation in security, storage and educational areas. It would also allow U.S. firms such as General Electric Co. and Bechtel Corp. to sell nuclear components and reactors to Vietnam, according to U.S. officials. \"If we're able to have U.S. companies and technologies in play in Vietnam this gives the ability to exert some leverage,\" said the U.S. official briefed on the negotiations. \"If we shut ourselves out, others may have different standards.\" U.S. officials stressed that any agreement with Vietnam will require that Hanoi's nuclear installations be under close oversight by the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. This is seen as insuring Vietnam's nuclear materials aren't diverted for military purposes. The Vietnamese are studying the agreement's final draft and further talks are expected in the fall, said American diplomats. The Obama administration has sought to significantly raise the U.S.'s profile in South and Southeast Asia amid concerns that China has begun to economically and politically dominate the region. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Hanoi last month and noted growing U.S.-Vietnamese cooperation. Mrs. Clinton backed Hanoi's position at a regional security forum that calls for establishing an international legal process to solve territorial disputes in the South China Sea. China attacked Mrs. Clinton's position as threatening Beijing's security interests. \"The Obama Administration is prepared to take the U.S.-Vietnam relationship to the next level,\" Mrs. Clinton said while in Hanoi. \"We see this relationship not only as important on its own merits, but as part of a strategy aimed at enhancing American engagement in the Asia Pacific.\" Tensions between Washington and Beijing have heated up again in recent weeks after relations between the two countries seemed to have stabilized in the spring. U.S. officials this week said they haven't been briefing Beijing, or seeking its approval, while conducting the nuclear talks with Vietnam. \"This is a negotiation between the U.S. and Vietnam,\" said the senior U.S. official. \"We don't ask China to approve issues that are in our own strategic interest.\" Officials at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs couldn't immediately be reached for comment. The U.S. has taken other steps in recent months to strengthen its ties to South and Southeast Asian nations historically wary of Chinese influence.",

        "original_text": "China's near-monopoly on rare earth metals poses no threat to US security, a Pentagon report is likely to conclude. The year-long study, which will be published this week, may serve to allay concerns that China, which produces 97% of the world's 17 rare earths vital to defence and technology industries, could re-impose a near-complete – and unannounced – export freeze that Beijing initiated in July. Last week, the EU, World Trade Organisation and US trade bodies called for urgent co-operation on the issue, arguing that current trade agreements regarding raw materials are inadequate. But a US defense department report seen by Bloomberg concludes that China's grip on the market poses no threat to the production of military equipment, including radar, night-vision goggles and precision-guidedbombs. The study estimates that the US defence industry uses 5% of the world's supply of metals like neodymium, samarium, and dysprosium, and raises the prospect that the department could help US providers like Molycorp, with loans and incentives to reopen rare earth mines in the western states. The Pentagon expects the supply to improve by 2013 once rare earth mines outside China, including Australia's Lynas Corp, begin production. The anxiety over China's dominance of the world's rare earth metal market comes amid increasing signs of China's accelerating technological prowess. China accounts for about 36% of reserves, the largest share, and the US is second, with 13%.",

The People's Bank of China issued regulations on Monday saying non-bank companies such as Alibaba, which operates the world's largest online marketplace for trade between businesses and China's largest retail e-commerce platform, would be allowed to provide third-party online payment services. The move establishes a legal basis for the first time for the country's booming online business. However, while the regulations allow third-party payment providers to apply for a licence with the central bank from September, the PBoC explicitly excluded companies with foreign capital from the new regulatory framework. Alibaba owns Alipay, which dominates China's online payment services with 70 per cent of the market. Yahoo of the US and Japan's Softbank are among the largest shareholders in Alibaba Group, which is unlisted. \"The business scope for foreign companies, the requirements for foreign investors in such businesses and the investment ratios [for] foreigners will be stipulated separately and reported to the State Council for approval,\" the central bank said. A senior executive at one internet company said yesterday that the move created a problem not just for companies such as PayPal, the world's largest online payments company, \"but for everyone with a shred of a foreign investment\". \"It means we will have to restructure our payment unit's shareholding, and virtually all players that matter in the Chinese market will have to restructure their shareholding as well,\" the executive said. Industry insiders said they believed the central bank's main motive for restricting foreign players in the industry would be to protect ChinaPay, the platform run by the country's banks. Chinese internet companies declined to comment amid concern that any critical remarks could jeopardise their chances of getting a licence. However, it is understood that Alibaba's management is considering hiving Alipay off. For Tencent, the implications are more far-reaching. The company is partly owned by Naspers, the South African media group, and listed in Hong Kong. Unlike Alipay in the Alibaba group, its payment business is not a separate legal entity. The new rules could require larger adjustments to Tencent's shareholding structure, industry observers said. 99 bill, a third-party online payment provider partly owned by US venture capital funds and several Chinese online gaming companies listed on Nasdaq, could also be hit.

        "title": "China climate talks cast the host in a flattering light | Jonathan Watts",
        "original_text": "The first three days of the Tianjin climate talks have thrown up some striking contrasts with the Copenhagen summit last December: dumplings instead of meatballs, order instead of chaos, quiet work instead of noisy intransigence. But perhaps the most remarkable difference is that while Copenhagen ended with China painted as the villain, Tianjin has started with the host nation cast in a distinctly flattering light. By paying the lion's share of the $5m (£3m) cost of this event, China looks set to have snapped up a public relations bargain. China's leaders were far from certain that this would be the case. In fact, they were so uneasy about hosting their first United Nations climate conference that it took the State Council four months to approve the plan. But once they gave the go ahead, the Tianjin talks were arranged in just two months – easily a record, according to those familiar with preparations for previous negotiating sessions. Putting on a week-long meeting for 3,000 delegates is no mean feat at any time. Yet the organisers have done it during one of the country's two most important national holidays. It is hard to imagine the US or any European nation interrupting Christmas or Easter to stage such an event, despite all their talk of \"saving the planet\". Delegates have praised the smooth organisation, particularly compared with Copenhagen, where the chaos started with four-hour queues at the front gate and ended with night-long rows in the conference rooms. Such comparisons are a little unfair. Copenhagen was a huge political summit, where the stress was as high as the expectations – and the stakes. Tianjin is a modest gathering of technocrats who appear far less burdened with the hopes and fears of the world. Whether the calmer and more workmanlike mood translates into substantive progress or weak ambition will be clearer at the end of the week. But the hosts have already achieved one objective: to show that actions speak louder than words. The choice of Tianjin is no accident. This port city exemplifies the speed at which China is moving towards a low-carbon future. This is the site of the country's most ambitious eco-city development, a carbon exchange, a high-speed rail network and what will be one of the world's most efficient coal plants equipped to capture carbon dioxide emissions. Speaker after speaker this week – Chinese academics and international environmentalists alike – have highlighted the concrete steps that the world's biggest emitter is taking to reduce its footprint. China is closing down thousands of wasteful factories in a drive to achieve its energy efficiency targets. Last year, it invested $34bn in clean energy projects, almost twice as much as the United States. Since 2007, its high-speed rail network has gone from almost nothing to be bigger than the rest of the world combined. The government is now drawing up a new five-year economic plan that looks likely to initiate the country's first mandatory carbon-trading scheme well before the US Senate. Many visiting delegates have expressed admiration and envy. US negotiators are just as likely to feel embarrassment and anxiety. Washington has yet to pass even modest climate legislation and is falling further and further behind in the race to lead a clean energy market that is forecast to be worth $13 trillion. Never mind the dumplings and meatballs, the starkest contrast so far this week is not between Tianjin and Copenhagen, it is between China and the United States.",
        "debiased_text": "The first three days of the Tianjin climate talks have demonstrated differences compared to the Copenhagen summit held last December, including variations in food, organization, and the overall atmosphere of the meetings. In contrast to the public perception of China as a negative figure in Copenhagen, the host nation in Tianjin is currently being viewed in a more positive light. China has covered the majority of the $5 million cost for the event, which has been noted as a strategic financial move. The Chinese leadership was uncertain about the outcome of hosting their first United Nations climate conference, as it required four months for the State Council to approve the plan. After approval, the event was organized within two months, a pace described as a record by those familiar with previous negotiations. Hosting a week-long meeting for 3,000 delegates is a significant task, especially during one of the country's two major national holidays. Delegates have acknowledged the event's smooth organization, noting this as a contrast to the challenges experienced in Copenhagen, which included long wait times and extended discussions. However, such comparisons may not be entirely fair, due to the differences in the scale and nature of the two events. The mood at Tianjin appears to be more methodical and focused on technical discussions, as opposed to the high-stakes political environment in Copenhagen. It remains to be seen whether the more measured approach will lead to significant progress or only limited commitments. Nonetheless, the hosts have been successful in showcasing their practical efforts towards reducing environmental impact. The selection of Tianjin as the venue was intentional, as it represents areas where China is progressing toward a low-carbon future, such as eco-city developments, a carbon exchange, a high-speed rail network, and a carbon dioxide capture-equipped coal plant. Both Chinese and international speakers have pointed out the nation's efforts to meet its energy efficiency goals, including the closure of inefficient factories and a substantial investment in clean energy, nearly double that of the United States in the previous year. Additionally, since 2007, China has expanded its high-speed rail network to a size greater than the combined total of the rest of the world. The government is currently preparing a new five-year economic plan which includes the potential initiation of the country's first mandatory carbon-trading scheme earlier than in the United States. Delegates from various countries have noted their admiration for China's efforts. In contrast, US negotiators are facing challenges with their own legislative process regarding climate change, as the United States has not yet passed significant climate legislation and is increasingly falling behind in the global clean energy market, which is projected to be worth $13 trillion."

Embassy Beijing, please see paragraph 2. -------------- ACTION REQUEST -------------- 2. (S/NF) Post is requested to draw on the points in para 4 below and to provide photographs in a demarche to the Government of China (GOC) on the issue of transfers of advanced conventional weapons such as MANPADS to Iran. NOTE THAT THE POINTS FLAGGED AS PROVIDED BY THE IC MUST BE USED VERBATIM. ---------- BACKGROUND ---------- 3. (S/NF) In April 2008, Coalition forces recovered from a cache in Basra, Iraq at least two Chinese-produced Iranian-supplied QW-1 MANPADS that we assess were provided by Iran to Iraqi Shia militants. The date of production for the recovered QW-1 systems is 2003, but it is not known when these particular launchers were transferred by China to Iran or when the launchers entered Iraq. We have demarched China repeatedly on its conventional arms transfers to Iran, urging Beijing to stop these transfers due to unacceptably high risk that such weapons would be diverted to militants and terrorists in Iraq and elsewhere. Beijing has typically responded by asserting that its sales are in accordance with international law, that it requires end-users to sign agreements pledging not to retransfer the weapons, or -- disingenuously in the judgment of USG technical experts -- that it cannot confirm that the weapons recovered by Coalition forces in Iraq are actually Chinese in origin. This latest recovery of Chinese-origin weapons in Iraq gives us yet another opportunity to present the Chinese government with concrete evidence that Iran is illicitly diverting Chinese-origin weapons and to urge Beijing to take concrete steps to halt future diversions and investigate past transfers to Tehran. -------------- TALKING POINTS -------------- 4. (S/REL CHINA) BEGIN TALKING POINTS: TRANSFERS OF MANPADS TO IRAN ----------------------------- -- We have repeatedly raised with you our concerns regarding Iran,s retransfer of Chinese-produced weapons to extremists and terrorists in Iraq and elsewhere. -- We understand that you have provided Iran with QW-1 MANPADS in the past, and Iran has publicly asserted that it produces the Misagh-1, which is based on the Chinese QW-1. -- We previously raised with you the recovery in Iraq in 2004 of an Iranian-origin Misagh-1 MANPAD that had been fired at a civilian airliner. -- We have recently acquired additional information about Iranian diversions of Chinese-origin MANPADS that we would like to share with you. BEGIN IC POINTS THAT MUST BE USED VERBATIM: -- Coalition forces recovered at least two Chinese QW-1 MANPADS missiles from a militant cache in Basra, Iraq in April 2008. The missiles had 2003 production markings, had not been fired, and were still intact in their launch tubes. -- We assess that these missiles were provided to Iraqi Shia militants by Iran. END IC POINTS THAT MUST BE USED VERBATIM. MANPADS TRANSFERS TO STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM --------------------------------------------- --- -- Iran is the world's most active state sponsor of terrorism. We know that Iran has provided Chinese weapons to extremist groups in Iraq and Afghanistan that are using these weapons to kill Americans and Iraqis, something we take very seriously. -- Iran is not a responsible purchaser of military equipment. There is an unacceptably high risk that any military equipment sold to Iran, especially weapons like MANPADS, that are highly sought-after by terrorists, will be diverted to non-state actors who threaten U.S. and Coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as civilians across the region. -- It is for that reason UNSCR 1747 calls on states to exercise vigilance and restraint in the transfer of systems contained in the UN Register of Conventional Arms, such as MANPADS. Likewise, the United Nations General Assembly passed resolution A/62/391 encouraging state members to ban the transfer of MANPADS to non-state actors. -- We strongly urge you to: terminate all weapons-related, including further MANPADS-related transfers and technical assistance to Iran, in accordance with UNSCR 1747; insist that Iran cease any weapons-production related activities based on or including Chinese technology, to include MANPADS technology; insist that Iran stop illicit retransfers of Chinese-origin weapons, or Iranian-produced weapons based on Chinese designs, to non-state actors; insist that Iran provide an accounting of all Chinese-origin weapons; and institute thorough, regular inspections of Chinese-origin weapons already in Iranian stocks to determine how many may have been diverted and to prevent future diversions. -- We ask that you share with us the results of your investigations into this matter. SERIAL NUMBERS OF WEAPONS SOLD TO IRAQ: ------------------------------------------ -- We have provided you with information on specific Chinese weapons systems that we have recovered in Iraq. -- Further information you can provide to us on your sales of these systems to Iran would help our investigators on the ground distinguish between weapons newly transferred to Shia militants and those transferred prior to the commencement of armed conflict in 2003.

        "original_text": "BEIJING -- North Korea's latest act of aggression against the South has prompted a new round of public debate in China on how to manage ties with a neighbor that is at once a close ally but, increasingly, a source of international embarrassment. The government's official response to North Korea's shelling of a South Korean island village remains cautious, stopping well short of criticism of the North. In comments reported Thursday, Premier Wen Jiabao said China opposes \"any provocative military behavior\" on the Korean peninsula. Mr. Wen was speaking in Russia as the U.S. and South Korea prepare for joint naval exercises in the Yellow Sea in response to the deadly attack. But it wasn't clear whether his warning referred to North Korea's attack, or to the South Korean exercises Pyongyang claims to have responded to, or to the planned naval drills between the U.S. and South Korea. Mr. Wen called the standoff between Seoul and Pyongyang a \"severely complicated situation,\" according to a statement posted on the Chinese Foreign Ministry's website. He called for \"all relevant parties to exercise the utmost restraint,\" and said \"the international community should do more work to ease the tension of the situation.\" Among Chinese foreign-policy circles and general citizens, there are growing signs of exasperation with Pyongyang's behavior. Some question how Beijing benefits from its old Communist ally's recent provocations. State media no longer display blind loyalty to the North. \"North Korea showed its toughness through the skirmish. But the move neither helps solve its economic plight, nor wins over understanding from other nations,\" said an editorial in the Global Times, a generally nationalistic English-language newspaper. \"The North tried to protect its own security in an inconceivable manner,\" it said. \"The U.S. and Japan tried economic sanctions, which proved futile. China and Russia could only appeal for restraint.\" A Chinese-language editorial on the newspaper's website described North Korea's actions as a \"public humiliation of the surrounding big countries' painstaking diplomatic efforts.\" The apparent frustration reflects the contradiction between China's staunch support for one of the world's most secretive and unpredictable regimes, and Beijing's desire to portray itself as a responsible member of the international community. It also highlights the increasingly diverse range of players trying to influence foreign policy in China -- which until recently was the exclusive preserve of the Communist Party's top leaders. On Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei offered a relatively mild response to an announcement by the U.S. and South Korea on Wednesday that the aircraft carrier USS George Washington would conduct exercises with the South Korean navy in the Yellow Sea just off the Chinese coast. \"We have taken note of the related reports, and express concern on this matter,\" he said. When the U.S. and South Korea considered staging a drill with the same carrier in the same area west of the Korean peninsula in July, Chinese officials vehemently protested, and the two countries instead conducted the drill on the east side of the peninsula. Pyongyang, meanwhile, struck a sharper tone Friday, saying the drills were pushing the situation to the \"brink of war.\" Mr. Hong confirmed that Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi has postponed his planned trip to South Korea for \"scheduling reasons.\" And he again expressed China's grief over the casualties in the artillery exchange on Tuesday. Asked about China's view of how the incident started, Mr. Hong said only that the two parties involved \"have different stories.\" China's main priority is to prevent any sudden collapse of the North Korean regime, which it fears would flood northeastern China with refugees and allow the roughly 30,000 U.S. troops now in South Korea to move up to the Chinese border. However, leaders are also increasingly sensitive to public opinion. And China is bracing for a planned state visit by President Hu Jintao to the U.S. in January, and a once-a-decade leadership change in 2012. China has been trying for the past two years to revive the so-called six-party talks among North and South Korea, China, the U.S., Japan and Russia, which are designed to persuade Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program. Yang Xiyu, a former Chinese diplomat who took part in the talks, said the North's recent actions had \"complicated\" those efforts. Other Chinese experts went further, warning that North Korean leader Kim Jong Il was now pursuing his own interests without taking China's into account. \"We are being coerced by North Korea,\" said one Chinese foreign-policy expert. \"This is an alliance from history, and we want to abandon it if they behave in this irresponsible way.\" Forged during the Korean War, when more than 180,000 Chinese died assisting the North, China's ties to Pyongyang now threaten to undermine China's image-building efforts and to strengthen relations among the U.S., Japan and South Korea. China attracted criticism by refusing to blame North Korea for March's sinking of a South Korean naval ship, which killed 46 sailors. President Hu also hosted Mr. Kim on two visits to China this year, and in October sent a senior party official to attend a ceremony in Pyongyang to anoint Mr. Kim's third son as the next leader of North Korea. Shen Dingli, an expert on international relations at Shanghai's Fudan University, said China should push for an international investigation of Tuesday's artillery exchanges to establish whether the North was the aggressor. \"Our alliance is based on mutual defense. We will defend North Korea if it is attacked. But we will not defend it if it attacks someone else,\" he said. --- Aaron Back contributed to this article.",
        "debiased_text": "BEIJING -- North Korea's recent actions have sparked discussions within China regarding the management of its relationship with a neighboring country that is both a historical ally and a growing source of international tensions. The Chinese government has maintained a cautious stance, expressing opposition to 'any provocative military behavior' on the Korean peninsula without directly condemning North Korea. These comments were made by Premier Wen Jiabao during a trip to Russia, as the U.S. and South Korea prepare for joint naval exercises in the Yellow Sea. It is unclear whether Wen's statement was specifically in reference to North Korea's attack, the South Korean exercises that Pyongyang claims to be responding to, or the planned U.S.-South Korea drills. According to a statement posted on the Chinese Foreign Ministry's website, Wen characterized the situation between Seoul and Pyongyang as 'severely complicated,' urging all relevant parties to exercise restraint and calling on the international community to assist in reducing tensions.\n\nThere are increasing signs of concern among some Chinese foreign policy analysts and citizens towards Pyongyang's recent behavior. Some individuals are questioning the benefits of maintaining a close relationship with North Korea given the recent provocations. State media in China have not displayed the same level of unconditional support for North Korea as before. An editorial published in the Global Times, a nationalistic English-language newspaper, stated that North Korea's actions 'neither help solve its economic plight, nor win over understanding from other nations.' The editorial also described North Korea's actions as a 'public humiliation of the surrounding big countries' diplomatic efforts.'\n\nThis frustration highlights the contradiction between China's unwavering support for the North Korean regime and its aspiration to be seen as a responsible international actor. It also shows the growing influence of a diverse range of entities in shaping China's foreign policy, which previously was dominated by the Communist Party's top leadership. On Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei responded relatively mildly to the announcement that the aircraft carrier USS George Washington would conduct exercises with the South Korean navy in the Yellow Sea off China's coast. Hong said, 'We have taken note of the related reports, and express concern on this matter.'\n\nPreviously, in July, Chinese officials protested when the U.S. and South Korea considered similar exercises in the same area, and the exercises were consequently moved to the east side of the Korean peninsula. On Friday, Pyongyang expressed a stronger stance, asserting that the exercises are pushing the situation towards 'the brink of war.' Hong confirmed that Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi has postponed his planned trip to South Korea for 'scheduling reasons.' He also reiterated China's concern over the casualties in the Tuesday artillery exchange between North and South Korea. When asked about China's perspective on the incident's origin, Hong stated only that the two parties involved 'have different stories.'\n\nChina's primary goal is to prevent any sudden destabilization of the North Korean regime, which it fears could lead to a refugee influx into northeastern China and allow the approximately 30,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea to approach its border. However, the Chinese leadership is also becoming increasingly attentive to public sentiment. The country is preparing for a planned state visit by President Hu Jintao to the U.S. in January and a significant leadership transition in 2012.\n\nOver the past two years, China has sought to reinvigorate the six-party talks, involving North Korea, South Korea, China, the U.S., Japan, and Russia, aimed at persuading Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program. Yang Xiyu, a former Chinese diplomat involved in the talks, noted that recent North Korean actions have 'complicated' these efforts. Some Chinese experts have expressed concern that North Korean leader Kim Jong Il is acting in his own interests rather than considering China's. One expert stated, 'We are being coerced by North Korea. This is an alliance from history, and we want to abandon it if they behave in this irresponsible way.'\n\nThe relationship between China and North Korea was established during the Korean War, in which over 180,000 Chinese soldiers lost their lives supporting North Korea. Currently, this relationship is seen as a potential threat to China's international reputation, as it strengthens ties among the U.S., Japan, and South Korea. China faced criticism for not attributing blame to North Korea following the March sinking of a South Korean naval ship, which resulted in the death of 46 sailors. President Hu Jintao also received Kim Jong Il on two visits this year, and in October, a senior Chinese party official attended a ceremony in Pyongyang to recognize Kim's third son as the next leader of North Korea. Shen Dingli, an international relations expert at Fudan University in Shanghai, suggested that China should push for an international investigation into the Tuesday artillery exchanges to determine if North Korea was the aggressor.

        "original_text": "Human rights campaigners condemned an Iranian television programme, aired tonight, which showed Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, the woman sentenced to death by stoning, at her home apparently discussing her part in the murder of her husband. Despite speculation that she had been released, Iran's state news agency confirmed that Mohammadi Ashtiani remains in prison. Her jailed son also appeared in the programme, in which he played the role of his father in a reconstruction. Iran's state-run Press TV, said it had been arranged with Iran's judicial authorities to accompany his mother to her house to record her recounting the crime and that she had agreed to do so. \"There are always two sides to a story and sometimes more,\" said the voice of a narrator who described Mohammadi Ashtiani as a \"prostitute\" and \"adulterous woman\". In what was portrayed as a 'confession' Mohammadi Ashtiani was filmed saying that one of her husband's relatives, Isa Saharkhiz, asked her to render her husband unconscious before he could electrocute him. \"We planned to kill my husband,\" she said, before showing in a reconstruction how she made him unconscious with an injection. Curiously, Press TV also broadcast footage of Saharkhiz, who remains free. It said he had not agreed to be interviewed but failed to explain why he remains at liberty. The channel also said Mohammadi Ashtiani's case remained open. It broadcast an interview with Mohammad Javad Larijani, an adviser to the Iranian supreme leader, in which he made previously reported comments that there was a \"good chance\" that her life could yet be spared. However, hopes that she had been freed after photographs emerged of her at her home before the broadcast were dashed. The Italian foreign minister, Franco Frattini, and Maureen Harper, the wife of the Canadian prime minister, were among those who had welcomed unconfirmed reports of Mohammadi Ashtiani's release. Based on the photographs, several newspapers around the world also wrongly reported that she had been freed. Earlier today Mousa Khalil-Elahi, a judiciary official in Tabriz, confirmed to Iran's state news agency, IRNA, that Mohammadi Ashtiani had not been freed. Khalil-Elahi was quoted by IRNA as saying: \"Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani is in prison and the reports about her release are false.\" He added: \"There's no development in her case and she is still kept in Tabriz prison. She is in good health.\"Mohammadi Ashtiani has already appeared on state TV three times, but activists say her apparent confessions have been coerced. Clare Bracey of Amnesty said: \"International standards for fair trial, to which Iran is a state party, guarantee the right not to be forced to incriminate oneself or to confess guilt. The judiciary is in charge of this case and would have to have given permission for such an interview to take place. To organise a televised 'confession' midway through a judicial review of a serious case – where a woman's life hangs in the balance – makes a mockery of Iran's legal system.\" She added: \"That judicial review [for Mohammadi Ashtiani] is further hampered by the fact that Sakineh's son and lawyer have been detained. If Sajad Qaderzadeh and Javid Houtan Kian are being held solely for peacefully highlighting Sakineh's case, they should be released immediately and unconditionally.\" Mohammadi Ashtiani's son Sajad was arrested in October along with her lawyer, Houtan Kian, and two German journalists who were detained after trying to interview her family. Mina Ahadi of the International Committee against Stoning (Icas) said in reaction: \"It is very, very sad for me to see that Iran has forced Sakineh's son, Sajad, to play in the role of his dead father in the reconstruction of the murder. This is really outrageous.\" Houtan Kian also appeared in front of the camera claiming that he and Sajad had been taking orders from Mina Ahadi, an Iranian human rights activist who has publicised Mohammadi Ashtiani's case internationally. Mohammadi Ashtiani was convicted in May 2006 of conducting an illicit relationship outside marriage. She was given a sentence of 99 lashes, but her case was reopened when a court in Tabriz suspected her of murdering her husband. She was acquitted, but the adultery charge was reviewed and a death penalty handed down on the basis of \"judge's knowledge\" – a loophole that allows for subjective judicial rulings where no conclusive evidence is present. Embarrassed by international condemnation of the stoning sentence, Iran has tried to distract attention from Mohammadi Ashtiani's initial charge of adultery by introducing new charges against her and portraying her as a murderer. Iran rarely carries out stonings. It executed 388 people last year, more than any other country apart from China, according to Amnesty International. Most were hanged. Ten Iranian women and four men are on death row awaiting execution by stoning.",

Ten women and four men are currently on death row awaiting execution by stoning."

No state can be allowed to get away with shelling its neighbour and killing their soldiers. South Korea, the US and China do not want war. But with boycotts already in place, they are running out of options. The current provocation demands a response - but one which does not help the Dear Leader and his son in their propaganda exercise or which escalates the violence. The US, preoccupied with Pyongyang's nuclear capability, has refused to restart six-country talks until Pyongyang dismantles that programme. It has no need as yet to respond to South Korea's call to bring back US nuclear weapons, though this would inflame Pyongyang and Beijing. Nor does the US have to show its hand at this stage regarding military action. Diplomacy should be the first option. China must stop ducking its responsibility. This is not a new call. The world's second largest economy is concerned less about nuclear proliferation than regime collapse: it shares 900 miles with North Korea and enjoys the buffer between itself and US troops in South Korea. China does exercise influence over the Kims' despotic rule. Pyongyang depends on Chinese goods. Beijing joined international sanctions after North Korea's 2006 missile test, but trades $2.8bn a year with Pyongyang. Yet Beijing persists in treating Pyongyang with undue respect. In July, it refused to condemn North Korea for attacking a South Korean warship and killing 46 sailors. It is now time for Beijing to ally itself more directly with Washington to start pressuring Pyongyang. It should publicly endorse joint sea patrols by South Korea and the US, stop hosting the Pyongyang regime and allow North Koreans to defect, not send them back. One issue the international community may agree on is the need for a plan to deal with Pyongyang's nuclear capability in the event of the regime's collapse. Such a strategy is important in its own right. But it could also be of tactical advantage, by signalling the beginnings of a joint front. Pyongyang has succeeded in drawing attention to itself and its new centrifuges. If it is satisfied with the reaction to the latest provocation, another will surely follow. The west and China must now show common resolve to confront a growing threat to regional security.",
        "debiased_text": "North Korea has taken actions that have drawn significant international attention. The country has conducted military provocations, including the shelling of its neighbor and the loss of life among military personnel. Several countries, including South Korea, the United States, and China, have expressed concerns about the potential for conflict and have implemented measures such as boycotts. These nations are seeking a response to the situation that avoids further escalation of violence and does not provide North Korea with propaganda advantages. The United States has indicated that it will not resume six-party talks until North Korea takes steps to dismantle its nuclear program. The U.S. has not yet committed to responding directly to South Korea's request to redeploy nuclear weapons, although such a move could increase tensions with both North Korea and China. At this stage, the U.S. is prioritizing diplomatic solutions. China has been called upon to take a more active role in addressing the situation, as it shares a long border with North Korea and has economic ties with the country, including annual trade worth $2.8 billion. China has previously participated in international sanctions following North Korea's 2006 missile test, but has not always taken firm positions on North Korean actions, such as its refusal to condemn the 2010 attack on a South Korean warship. Some suggest that China should collaborate more closely with the United States to exert pressure on North Korea, including endorsing joint sea patrols, stopping the practice of hosting North Korean officials, and allowing North Koreans to defect without returning them. There is also a call for the development of a strategy to address North Korea's nuclear capabilities in the event of a regime change. This strategy is seen as important for regional security and could serve as a demonstration of unified international resolve."

        "title": "Alibaba.com has grown to a $15bn trading platform in 10 years",
        "original_text": "Britain's status as a leading trading nation is alive and well, according to David Wei, the boss of Alibaba.com, China's largest commercial online marketplace. While most businesses sign up with Alibaba to import cheap goods directly from Chinese factories – from electrical appliances, sheet metal and plastic mouldings to solar panels and oak flooring – a large and growing number of UK firms want to sell to China as much as they want to buy. While the debate rages over the damage done to Britain's industrial heartlands during the recession, Wei's message is that small and medium-sized businesses around the country rank among the most far-sighted in the world in their drive to trade. In a centuries old tradition, they want to sell to the Chinese everything from speciality chemicals to graphic design services, accountancy, engineered car parts and fragrant soap. David Wei, one of China's most prominent businessmen, says the distinction is crucial. \"Most companies sign up on our website to buy cheap goods from China to support their own manufacturing. But the UK is no longer a manufacturing centre and so it doesn't need the raw materials or plastic parts sold on our site. It wants finished goods. And it wants to trade. The UK is one of the few countries that wants to buy and sell from other Chinese businesses. We love to see a country that is more involved in trading and sees the relationship on our site as two-way.\" Wei runs Alibaba.com from its base in Hangzhou, south of Shanghai. Far from being a pantomime joke, in the last 10 years Alibaba has become a $15bn (£9bn) internet trading platform the largest of its kind in China and widely seen as a gateway into the country by businesses in the West – an eBay for companies involved in international trade. \"If you look at the US, we have 1.9 million users, but more than 96% of them register as buyers only. Compare that with the UK where 19% have registered as buyers and sellers,\" he says. Alibaba and its chairman Jack Ma recently sparked controversy in the US after he backed the Chinese government over its spat with Google. Ma, who sold shares worth $35m last September, is willing to comply with strict rules governing access to China's internet, while Google, smarting from complaints by customers alleging government-backed hacking of their accounts, has threatened to shut its operations. Some analysts believe Ma is happy to see Google shut to clear the way for a revival of Yahoo in China. He runs the Chinese arm after Yahoo sold it in 2005 as part of a deal to acquire a 40% stake in Alibaba. The row put him in conflict with Yahoo, which took sides with Google, but Ma appears unperturbed by disputes with his largest shareholder. His business is now one of the largest and most valuable in China. Ma's other main offshoot is taobao.com, a consumer auction site that dominates the market after eBay shut its China operation in 2006. Wei believes the financial crisis is behind a sharp rise in online trading. \"Businesses wanted to cut costs and find new customers, so they use the online platform to get them through the worst of it and build new relationships.\" It recently noticed a big jump in demand for secondhand goods, especially from downmarket retailers in the US and Britain offering cheap products to poor families. They buy secondhand goods in bulk on Alibaba and trade them in their shops. During its 10 years, Alibaba has remained largely unknown to the British public, something the company wants to change. An advertising splurge last year followed the introduction of its AliPay facility to the UK, which attempts to rid its website of fraud (it already has more than 150 million users in China). The introduction of factory inspections next year is designed to go a stage further. \"Factory inspections add to our overheads, but they are necessary to cut down on fraud. We can't eradicate fraud, but it will help. And the situation is not so bad. We de-listed 100 of our \"gold\" suppliers last year out of 90,000. Wei is aware that much of the unsolicited publicity around Alibaba has centred on the potential for fraud as sellers, often individual factory owners, disappear with buyers' cash without delivering any goods. EBay has suffered similar criticism. The new Alipay system creates an escrow account that holds cash until delivery is complete. It may seem cumbersome, but compared to obtaining a letter of credit from a local bank, it is cheaper and easier to arrange. Wei's praise for entrepreneurial Britain is tempered by his criticism of the UK's bigger companies and their slavish capitulation to the short term demands of investors. It is a timely comment, given the recent takeover of Cadbury for what is widely believed to be a bargain price. He said: \"Older industries work for capital markets when capital markets should facilitate industry. You can tell something about a business when you look to see if the shareholder is number one or the customer. We are a business that is completely focused on the customer.\" He despairs of the influence held by hedge funds and other short term investors in western markets, especially the UK and US. \"People ask me how long they should hold their shares and I tell them if you plan to hold them for three days, there is nothing I can do for you, but if you plan to hold them for three years then I will pay attention to what you say.\" Last year, Ma told a meeting of his shareholders to \"go invest in other companies that put shareholders first,\" if they wanted quick returns. Ma said an internally \"controversial\" decision to sacrifice his company's profit margin was needed to save China's small-and-medium enterprises, which suffered a collapse in exports after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008. Ma cut subscriber fees by 60% to sign up more SMEs. Fees have stayed low because most SMEs have benefited little from a credit boom driven by bank lending to larger Chinese firms. Ma told the same meeting that his goal was not to create \"the most profitable company in China or the world,\" but to give China a global brand that will match the biggest in the US. \"If Alibaba cannot become a Microsoft or Wal-Mart, I will regret it for the rest of my life.\" Playing safe Chinese women concerned about the safety of toys made in their own country have bypassed local shops and bought direct from Japanese retailers, according to Alibaba.com boss David Wei. The latest scandal involved Chinese manufacturers substituting lead with the more dangerous heavy metal cadmium in sparkling charm bracelets and shiny pendants. To avoid contamination, mothers have turned to Japan via Alibaba's taobao.com consumer auction site. Wei said the new middle class also wanted upmarket prams, cots and clothes, which is where the Japanese retailers clean up. Reputation is everything, he said. Chinese women keep up with the latest fashion trends by sourcing clothes directly from Italy and cosmetics by the tonne from Korea. \"When Chinese shoppers cannot get what they want on their own high street, or they have a problem with Chinese products, they don't accept it, they use our site to find what they want. Skin care products from Korea are very popular. \"Also, the one baby policy means parents want only the best for their child and that often means buying nursery equipment and baby products direct from Japan,\" he said.",
        "debiased_text": "David Wei, the head of Alibaba.com, noted that Britain's status as a leading trading nation remains strong. While many businesses use Alibaba to import affordable goods directly from Chinese factories, an increasing number of UK companies are also interested in selling to China. In contrast to the ongoing discussion regarding the impact of the recession on Britain's industrial areas, Wei emphasized that UK small and medium-sized businesses are seeking to expand their trade with China. These companies are interested in selling items such as speciality chemicals, graphic design services, accountancy, engineered car parts and fragrant soap. Wei said that the UK is one of the few countries that seeks to engage in both buying and selling with Chinese businesses. Alibaba, which is based in Hangzhou, south of Shanghai, has evolved into a $15bn internet trading platform, the largest of its kind in China. It is considered a gateway for Western businesses aiming to trade internationally. Wei noted that in the US, 96% of the 1.9 million users register only as buyers, whereas in the UK, 19% register as both buyers and sellers. Recently, Alibaba and its chairman Jack Ma generated controversy in the US after Ma's support for the Chinese government in its conflict with Google. While Ma is willing to comply with regulations regarding access to China's internet, Google has made threats to shut down its operations in response to customer complaints about government-backed hacking of accounts. Some analysts believe that this conflict could be beneficial to Yahoo's revival in China, as Yahoo had sold its Chinese operations to Alibaba in 2005. The dispute placed Ma at odds with Yahoo, which aligned with Google, but he seems to be unaffected by the disagreement with his main shareholder. Alibaba has also seen a rise in online trading activity, with Wei attributing this to the financial crisis. He believes that businesses wanted to reduce costs and find new clients, leading them to use online platforms for this purpose. Recently, there has been a notable increase in the demand for secondhand goods, mostly from budget-oriented retailers in the US and UK selling affordable products to economically disadvantaged families. These retailers purchase secondhand items in bulk from Alibaba to resell them locally. Over the past decade, Alibaba has been relatively unknown in Britain, though the company aims to change this. In the previous year, the company launched an advertising campaign following the introduction of its AliPay facility in the UK. This initiative aims to reduce fraud on its website, which already has over 150 million users in China. The company plans to introduce factory inspections in the coming year as another measure to minimize fraud. Wei stated that factory inspections increase costs but are important in reducing fraudulent activities. He revealed that 100 of the company's 90,000 \"gold\" suppliers were de-listed last year. Wei acknowledged that much of the negative attention Alibaba receives is related to the potential for fraud, where individual factory owners may take buyers' money without delivering the goods. EBay has also been criticized in this regard. The new Alipay system enables an escrow account that holds payments until the goods are delivered. While this process may appear complicated, it is viewed as more cost-effective and simpler than securing a letter of credit from a local bank. Wei expressed his admiration for UK entrepreneurial businesses, yet criticized larger companies for their focus on short-term investor demands. This statement comes after the recent acquisition of Cadbury, which many consider to be at a low price. He opined that the traditional role of older industries in catering to capital markets should instead be the opposite, with capital markets facilitating industry. He recommended that shareholders who expect quick returns should invest elsewhere. Wei also mentioned the influence of hedge funds and short-term investors in western markets, particularly in the UK and US. He advised that if investors expect to hold their shares for only three days, there is not much he can do for them, but if they plan to hold shares for three years, he would take their input seriously. In a shareholders' meeting last year, Ma stated that an internally \"controversial\" decision to reduce profit margins by 60% was necessary to support small-and-medium enterprises in China, which saw a decline in exports following the 2008 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. The reduction in fees has been maintained as most SMEs have not significantly benefited from the recent credit expansion driven by banking loans to larger firms. Ma indicated that his goal is not to create the most profitable company in China or the world, but rather to give China a global brand that can rival the largest US companies. He said, \"If Alibaba cannot become a Microsoft or Wal-Mart, I will regret it for the rest of my life.\" In another context, Wei highlighted that Chinese women concerned about the safety of toys produced in their own country have been purchasing directly from Japanese retailers through Alibaba's consumer auction site, taobao.com. This recent issue involved Chinese manufacturers replacing lead with cadmium in charm bracelets and pendants. Mothers are avoiding potentially contaminated products by sourcing from Japanese retailers. The new middle class in China also has a demand for high-end baby products and nursery equipment, which Japanese retailers are catering to. Wei added that Chinese shoppers who cannot find the desired items locally often turn to Alibaba's site to purchase from Italy and Korea. Skin care products imported from Korea have been very popular. The one-child policy also encourages parents to spend more on the best products for their children, often acquired directly from Japan."

        "original_text": "The US fears China is plotting internet warfare via private companies that are known to have recruited top hackers. According to leaked cables, the state department is concerned about Beijing's close working relationship with two major providers of information security in China. The companies have hired experienced hackers, who include Lin Yong, aka Lion, who founded the Honker Union of China, a Chinese hacker group that emerged after the US bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999 and launched a series of cyber attacks on US government-related websites. XFocus, a Chinese hacker group that released the blaster worm in August 2003, infecting computers using Windows XP and Windows 2000 worldwide, is also believed to have worked with a Chinese IT security company with government links that has access to the source code for Microsoft Windows. \"There is a strong possibility the PRC [People's Republic of China] is harvesting the talents of its private sector in order to bolster offensive and defensive computer network operations capabilities,\" a secret state department circular from June 2009 said. It warned that the \"potential linkages of China's top companies with the PRC illustrate the government's use of its private sector in support of information warfare objectives\". Topsec, China's largest IT security provider, and Venustech, another leading Chinese IT security firm, are part of the China Information Technology Security Centre, which signed an international agreement with Microsoft that allowed them access to source code in order to secure the Windows platform. Shortly after the centre gained access to the code, a senior officer from the People's Liberation Army communications regiment was sent to receive network security training, according to the cable. Lion was hired to manage security services and training at Topsec during 2002 and 2003, the dispatch said. The Americans were alerted to the links during an interview granted by Topsec's founder, He Weidong. He said the Chinese government had invested in his company, supplying half of Topsec's start-up capital and awarding it research and development contracts. A series of cables, entitled \"cyber threat\", reveal that the state department is fighting internet attacks on several fronts, with threats coming from Iran and Islamic militants in India and China. They identify a group of Iranian hackers that is developing abilities to breach wireless networks, and \"tech-savvy groups such as the Indian mujahideen – whose members have received training on wireless hacking and have implemented sophisticated techniques in support of terrorist attacks – also seek to develop hacking proficiency and methodologies\". A 2008 cable revealed that, since 2002, cyber intruders involved in what is referred to as the Byzantine candor (BC) attack, believed to originate from China, have exploited the vulnerabilities of Windows to steal login credentials and gain access to hundreds of US government and cleared defence contractor systems over the years. The cable ran: \"In the US, the majority of the systems BC actors have targeted belong to the US army, but targets also include other department of defence services as well as department of state, department of energy, additional US government entities, and commercial systems and networks.\" Officials involved in talks with China at the Copenhagen climate change summit in 2009 were subject to a cyber attack containing the \"poison ivy\" remote access tool intended to give hackers almost complete control over the victim's system. \"The message had the subject line 'China and Climate Change' and was spoofed to appear as if it were from a legitimate international economics columnist at the National Journal,\" according to the secret cable entitled \"Diplomatic security daily\". \"In addition, the body of the email contained comments designed to appeal to the recipients as it was specifically aligned with their job function.\" The cable added: \"State department employees dealing with sensitive matters are often targets of social-engineering schemes conducted by actors seeking to harvest sensitive information,\" said the cable. \"As negotiations on… climate change continue, it is probable intrusion attempts such as this will persist.\"",

The body of the email contained content tailored to appeal to the recipients based on their job roles. The cable also noted that State Department employees engaged in sensitive matters are commonly targeted by social-engineering schemes designed to obtain confidential information. It further stated that as negotiations on climate change continue, similar intrusion attempts are likely to remain a concern."

        "original_text": "BEIJING -- Local officials in China's arid northwest launched a new push for a vast water-diversion project that would pump raw seawater thousands of miles from the coast to the deserts of Xinjiang through a pipeline made of plastic and fiberglass. The idea is to desalinate some of the seawater, but to use the rest to fill Xinjiang's dried-up salt lakes and desert basins in the hope that it will evaporate and encourage rainfall over drought-stricken areas of northern and northwestern China. Local government officials and water experts held a conference in Xinjiang Friday to give new impetus to the proposal under which seawater would be pumped across four mountain ranges on its way from the Bohai Sea off the coast of northeast China via Inner Mongolia to Xinjiang. Several water experts and environmental activists have condemned the proposal, comparing it to the giant Three Gorges Dam and another controversial scheme to channel the waters of the Yangtze River from southern to northern China. But Li Xin'e, a local official who organized Friday's conference, defended the idea as one of the only ways to alleviate the water shortages that she said were crippling development across northwestern China. Ms. Li, who heads the economics department of Xinjiang's Development Research Center, said the project now under way to divert the Yangtze from south to north would ease water shortages in central and northern China. \"However, northwestern China still faces a water-supply problem,\" she said. She said the Xinjiang government had filed a report on the proposal to the State Council -- China's cabinet -- in 2006 and Premier Wen Jiabao had read it and asked for more detailed research, which has been completed. The central government didn't respond to requests to comment. But the State Council Research Office in a 2007 report agreed the project was feasible and could help ease water shortages, reduce dust pollution, and boost coal production, according to a copy seen by The Wall Street Journal. Ms. Li said the central government hadn't yet allocated funding, or a government department to oversee the project. Local authorities were pushing ahead with their own plans in Xinjiang, the northeastern province of Liaoning and the northern region of Inner Mongolia. Liaoning and Inner Mongolia have both suffered severe water shortages in recent years. China's latest five-year plan, which was approved by the Communist Party's Central Committee last month, included a call to \"encourage seawater desalination,\" but didn't mention any specific projects. \"Of course, there are some different opinions,\" Ms. Li said. \"Some geology and meteorology departments thought the seawater could bring ecological disaster. But actually, the technical barriers have been removed.\" She said big advances had been made in desalination technology in the Middle East, the U.S. and the European Union. The U.S.-based International Desalination Association says advances in filter-membrane and distillation technology have lowered costs and made the industry more energy-efficient. There is no estimate of the total cost of the project or the volume of water involved. Some Chinese experts at Friday's conference said they expect the cost of transporting seawater to Xinjiang to be about 7 yuan ($1.05) per cubic meter, compared with 20 yuan for the south-north Yangtze diversion scheme. But others call the project unfeasible and urge the government to focus instead on limiting consumption and recycling wastewater rather than investing billions of dollars in a project that probably would take decades to build. Environmental activists, meanwhile, likened the plan to the $23 billion Three Gorges Dam, which was completed in 2006. Beijing says the dam is the best way to end centuries of deadly annual floods and to provide energy to fuel China's economic boom. Critics argue that it cost too much, forced 1.4 million people from their homes, and could increase the risk of landslides, earthquakes and damage to the Yangtze's ecology. Patricia Adams, the head of Probe International, a Toronto-based environmental group that campaigned against the Three Gorges, said the Xinjiang scheme was \"more the product of propaganda than serious science.\" She added, \"This isn't a serious attempt to meet real water needs and solve real environmental problems and it would be a terrible waste of money that the Chinese people can ill afford.\"",
        "debiased_text": "BEIJING -- Local officials in China's arid northwest have initiated a new proposal for a large-scale water-diversion project, which aims to transport seawater from the Bohai Sea, off the coast of northeast China, thousands of miles to Xinjiang via a pipeline constructed from plastic and fiberglass.

Environmental activists have compared the plan to the Three Gorges Dam, which was completed in 2006. While the Chinese government highlights the dam's benefits in preventing flooding and supporting economic growth, critics argue it had significant environmental and social costs, including displacement of 1.4 million people and ecological risks. Patricia Adams, leader of Probe International, an environmental group based in Toronto, described the Xinjiang scheme as more of a propaganda effort than a scientifically sound solution, stating it does not address actual water needs or environmental concerns and would be a costly misallocation of resources."

        "title": "Bismarck holds lessons for a rising China; Bismarck holds lessons for a rising China",
        "original_text": "Both America and China have blinked in their dispute over the renminbi's exchange rate. A fortnight before Tim Geithner was due to pronounce on whether China manipulates its currency, the US Treasury secretary postponed the report. The decision followed President Hu Jintao's announcement that he would attend this week's US-led nuclear disarmament summit for forthright discussions on imposing new sanctions on Iran and curbing North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. Although putting the renminbi on the back-burner serves the interests of both Washington and Beijing, the world's response to the debate suggests the dangers of such brinksmanship. America received almost no support for its tough stance, save for some mild words of rebuke from Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and a soft joint letter of protest from five leaders of the Group of 20. There was a deafening silence from Japan and South Korea, both of which have massive investments in China. Their most powerful companies' profits are linked to China's export success, which a stronger renminbi would undermine. But Beijing should not take comfort from this because its neighbours are increasingly jittery about Chinese power. Evidence can be found in India's efforts not only to forge an alliance with the US but, during Vladimir Putin's recent visit, to revive military ties with Russia. A call from Yuriko Koike, the former Japanese defence minister, for a strengthening of Japanese-Indian military ties also suggests that the region's powers are looking for ways to contain China. The critical moment came last year. In providing military aid and advice to Sri Lanka as it crushed the Tamil rebels, China revealed a willingness to wield its military might outside of its traditional sphere of influence, dramatically challenging India. Moreover, by extending credits to prop up former Soviet states in central Asia and eastern Europe - demonstrating in financial terms its rejection of Russia's claim to an exclusive \"sphere of influence\" in its near abroad - China showed its determination to maintain the post-cold war settlement across Eurasia. China's rapid economic growth over 30 years, combined with its military build-up, has made it Asia's strongest power. After centuries of dominance by powers outside Asia or on its periphery - Russia, Britain, the US and Japan - China is reasserting the sway it held for most of its history and is exerting pressure in new areas, as in Sri Lanka. Leaders in Beijing will need to become foreign-policy jugglers as they seek to prevent regional coalitions to keep China in check, maintain tolerably amicable relations with the US and develop an \"Ostpolitik\" to keep smaller neighbours - such as members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations - happy. This juggling act is reminiscent of that required of Otto von Bismarck, the 19th century's master diplomat-conjuror, after he united Germany. Bismarck strove ruthlessly to achieve unification and what he considered Prussia's rightful place among the great powers. Having achieved these aims, he sought to preserve a new European equilibrium through prudence and restraint. But Germany had so mobilised its resources and nationalist sentiments that it terrified its neighbours. Soon, Bismarck was speaking of \"the nightmare of hostile coalitions\". For all his efforts, it was a nightmare that would come true. China's dilemma is that, like Bismarck's Germany, it surpasses in power all its neighbours combined (save for Russia with respect to its nuclear arsenal). To avoid the fate of the Second Reich, China must recognise and publicly accept that it is no longer a developing country but a global power with responsibilities that extend beyond its immediate national interests. It will need to explain its actionsand factor other countries' interests into its policies. The dispute over the renminbi is a wake-up call for Beijing. But pulling back from the brink with the US is not enough. Nor can China rely on Asia's \"great chain of production\" providing it with a secure and stable region. As with the Asian crisis of 1997, when China shunned beggar-thy-neighbour currency policies, what is needed above all is a commitment to neighbourly multilateralism.

        "debiased_text": "Both the United States and China have made adjustments in their dispute over the exchange rate of the renminbi. Tim Geithner, the U.S. Treasury secretary, postponed a report on whether China manipulates its currency, a decision that occurred a fortnight before its original release date. This followed President Hu Jintao's announcement that he would attend a U.S.-led nuclear disarmament summit for discussions on imposing new sanctions on Iran and limiting North Korea's nuclear weapons program. While both countries seem to benefit from deferring the issue of the renminbi's exchange rate, the global reaction to the dispute indicates the risks involved in such diplomatic maneuvering. The U.S. received minimal international support for its firm position, with only mild criticism from Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and a joint letter of protest from five leaders of the Group of 20. There was no notable response from Japan and South Korea, which have substantial investments in China. Their major corporations' profitability is closely tied to China's export success, which could be negatively impacted by a stronger renminbi. However, Beijing should not consider this silence as a sign of comfort, as its neighbors increasingly express concern over its growing influence. This is evident in India's efforts to form an alliance with the U.S. and, during a recent visit by Vladimir Putin, to reinvigorate military ties with Russia. Additionally, Yuriko Koike, a former Japanese defense minister, has advocated for strengthening military cooperation between Japan and India, indicating regional powers are seeking to manage China's influence. A key moment in this development occurred last year, when China provided military assistance and advice to Sri Lanka during its conflict with Tamil rebels. This demonstrated China's willingness to exert military influence beyond its usual geographic boundaries, challenging India's regional dominance. Furthermore, by offering financial credits to former Soviet states in Central Asia and Eastern Europe, China has signaled its rejection of Russia's claims to an exclusive sphere of influence in its near abroad, reinforcing its commitment to the post-Cold War order across Eurasia. China's rapid economic growth over the past 30 years, combined with its military expansion, has established it as the strongest power in Asia. Following centuries of external dominance by countries like Russia, Britain, the U.S., and Japan, China is reasserting its historical regional influence and extending its reach into new areas, such as Sri Lanka. Leaders in Beijing will need to carefully manage foreign policy to avoid forming regional coalitions aimed at containing China, maintain reasonably good relations with the U.S., and cultivate a policy of engagement with smaller neighbors, including members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. This situation echoes the foreign policy challenges faced by Otto von Bismarck in the 19th century after uniting Germany. Bismarck sought to maintain a European balance of power through prudence and restraint after achieving unification and securing Prussia's position among the great powers. However, the growing strength and nationalist sentiment in Germany led to fears and tensions with neighboring countries, ultimately resulting in hostile coalitions. China's challenge is similar, as it now surpasses the combined power of its neighbors (except for Russia in nuclear capability). To prevent a similar outcome, China must acknowledge its status as a global power with responsibilities extending beyond its national interests. It must communicate its actions and consider the interests of other countries in its policies. The dispute over the renminbi's exchange rate serves as a reminder for Beijing. However, stepping back from the brink with the U.S. is not sufficient. China cannot rely solely on the regional 'great chain of production' to ensure a stable environment. As seen during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, when China avoided policies that could disadvantage its neighbors, what is essential now is a commitment to multilateral cooperation with its regional counterparts."

Chinese investments in US Treasuries are \"market investment behaviour and we don't wish to politicise them\", Yi Gang, director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said yesterday. \"We are a responsible investor and in the process of these investments we can definitely achieve a mutually beneficial result.\" China is the biggest foreign holder of US Treasury bonds and its leaders have voiced fears that US policies would see the dollar's value fall. The composition of China's reserves is a state secret but data showing an apparent decline in its direct holdings of US Treasuries led to speculation that Beijing might be cutting its holdings to signal political displeasure with Washington. The US and China have clashed over issues including arms sales to Taiwan , climate change, Tibetand Beijing's internet controls. Analysts said monthly Treasury data showing a dip in Chinese holdings did not capture the extent of Safe's purchases through international banks and financial centres such as London and Hong Kong. The data, once revised at the end of the second quarter, are likely to show that China continued to buy US Treasuries, although it might have allowed some short-term debt to mature as it bought longer-term US government securities. Analysts said that if China had been dumping dollars, there would be more volatility in US bond markets, with big sell-offs matched by corresponding purchases of other foreign assets. No market outside the US and eurozone government bond market is big enough to absorb a large-scale diversification of Chinese reserves without volatility. \"The US Treasury market is the biggest bond market in the world and our foreign exchange reserves are relatively large, so as you can imagine the US Treasury market is an important one for us,\" Mr Yi said in Beijing. \"Buying and selling US government bonds is something our investment team does every day and is completely normal.\" According to analysts and people who work closely with Safe, about two-thirds of China's reserves are invested in US dollardenominated assets.

They noted that no bond market outside of the US and eurozone is large enough to absorb a significant shift in Chinese reserves without causing volatility.\n\nYi Gang stated in Beijing that the US Treasury market is the largest bond market globally, and given the size of China's foreign exchange reserves, it plays an important role for them. He described the buying and selling of US government bonds as a regular and normal activity conducted by the investment team.\n\nAccording to analysts and individuals closely associated with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, approximately two-thirds of China's reserves are invested in assets denominated in US dollars.

        "original_text": "China has overtaken the US as home of the world's fastest supercomputer. Tianhe-1A, named for the Milky Way, is capable of sustained computing of 2.507 petaflops – equivalent to 2,507 trillion calculations each second. The US scientist who maintains the international rankings visited it last week and said he believed it was 1.4 times faster than the former number one, the Cray XT5 Jaguar in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. That topped the list in June with a rate of 1.75 petaflops. The US is home to more than half of the world's top 500 supercomputers. China had 24 in the last list, but has pumped billions of pounds into developing its computational ability in recent years. The machines are used for everything from modelling climate change and studying the beginnings of the universe to assisting aeroplane design. Housed in the northern port city of Tianjin, near Beijing, Tianhe-1A was developed by the National University of Defence Technology. The system was built from thousands of chips made by US firms – Intel and Nvidia – but domestic researchers developed the networking technology that allows information to be exchanged between servers at extraordinary speeds. Tianjin's weather bureau and the National Offshore Oil Corporation data centre are already using it for trial projects. \"It can also serve the animation industry and bio-medical research,\" Liu Guangming, director of the National Centre for Supercomputing, told China Daily. Tianhe-1A was in seventh place in the last rankings. Its domestic rival Nebulae, housed in Shenzhen, was at that time ranked second, capable of sustained computing of 1.271 petaflops. The next set of rankings is due next week, but Jack Dongarra, the University of Tennessee computer scientist who oversees them, told the New York Times that Tianhe-1 \"blows away the existing number one\". Wu-chun Feng, a supercomputing expert and professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, told the NYT: \"What is scary about this is that the US dominance in high-performance computing is at risk. One could argue that this hits the foundation of our economic future.\" Professor Arthur Trew, of Edinburgh University, who oversees the UK's HECToR supercomputer, said the Sino-American battle to have the fastest device was not particularly significant. \"They are showing off with big machines – fine. It's the underlying message that is important. The fact they are pumping this kind of money into building these machines in general is far more important … Europe is being left behind,\" he said. \"Having the computer is only half the battle. You have to use it, use it sensibly, and actually produce results. That requires software and brains and a lot of investment on top of the machine.\" Trew added: \"The number of software engineers that China is turning out and putting into centres dwarfs anything we are doing in the west. I remember going to Shanghai and being astounded by the number of people they had – hundreds. Edinburgh is one of the largest centres in Europe and we have got 100.\" Essentially, supercomputers allow research that could not otherwise be done because it involves calculations too complex to solve by other means or where an experiment cannot be carried out. \"Where you have complexity and cannot experiment – because a system is too large or small, or [the effect] happens too quickly or slowly, or it is just too expensive – you have to simulate it … The range of applications is growing and growing,\" said Trew.

        "original_text": "China pushed its currency sharply lower against the U.S. dollar Thursday, surprising markets and essentially wiping out gains the yuan had made since Beijing loosened its peg against the dollar in June. China's handling of the yuan is a highly sensitive political issue. The yuan's latest move could renew congressional efforts to pass legislation aimed at pressuring China to revamp its currency policy. The yen, meanwhile, softened as Japanese officials stepped up the rhetoric over the yen's recent strength amid more predictions that Japan's already fragile economy could be imperiled by the currency's rise. On Wednesday the yen had hit its strongest level against the dollar in 15 years. The dollar was trading at 85.91 yen late Thursday, compared with 85.40 Wednesday. The dollar was broadly stronger as investors continued to gravitate toward the U.S. currency as a haven amid worries about the global economy. The euro, which fell steeply against the dollar on Wednesday as investors reassessed the global growth outlook, lost ground to $1.2827 late Thursday. But much of the attention was on China, where the People's Bank of China set the dollar-yuan central-parity rate at a seven-week high 6.8015, up from 6.7768 yuan on Wednesday. Traders had been expecting the PBOC to set the dollar-yuan rate at 6.7800. \"I thought I had read the number wrong,\" said a Beijing trader at a European bank. In subsequent over-the-counter-market trading, the dollar closed at 6.7851 yuan. At that level the yuan is up just 0.6% against the dollar since June 19, when China announced it would allow greater flexibility in the yuan's exchange rate. The unexpected move was interpreted as China driving home the point that it wanted to see the yuan move not just higher, as many economists believe it should, but also lower. \"The only way to explain [the yuan's drop] is that the PBOC wants to artificially create two-way moves in the yuan, pushing the dollar-yuan level higher for the sole purpose of giving it room to fall later,\" Wang Qing, an economist at Morgan Stanley. \"When the dollar weakened steadily [against major currencies] in recent weeks, the yuan reacted very little,\" Mr. Wang said. \"At the same time, recent data show China's trade surplus has risen significantly. All this suggests the yuan should appreciate.\" Just this week data showed that the U.S. trade deficit with China hit its widest level in two years during June. The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that the trade gap with China widened 17% in June from the previous month to $26.2 billion. China this week reported that its surplus hit an 18-month high of $28.7 billion in July. The trade deficit, coupled with the yuan's drop, could spur lawmakers in Washington to act. A Treasury Department spokeswoman on Thursday declined to comment on the yuan's latest move, but referred to comments made by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Aug. 4. Mr. Geithner noted that China is \"only at the beginning of that process and what matters is how far and how fast they let it move.\" The last time China let the exchange rate move in a period between 2006 and 2008, he said, the yuan moved 20%. \"What's important to us and I think to all of China's trading partners is they actually let it appreciate significantly in response to market courses.\" Ted Truman, a former assistant Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, said that if the trend of softening persists against the dollar, \"it would be problematic,\" especially given that the Chinese currency hasn't moved much since June. \"If it persists, it's a problem for us and for them and for the world,\" he said. \"The probability of Congress acting [on some punitive legislation aimed at pressuring China over its currency policy] will go up. And the difficulty the president might have to veto the legislation in an election year will go up. Ultimately it could be a big mess.\" The yuan's move also comes against the backdrop of news showing that China's red-hot economy continues to cool off. China reported that industrial-production growth eased to 13.4% in July from 13.7% in June. In addition, data on bank lending and retail sales came in softer than expected. Meanwhile the yen's retreat against the dollar came as Japanese officials increased their warnings about the currency's strength in recent weeks. So far this year the dollar has fallen by 7.7% against the yen and traders have been wondering if the move might spark efforts by Tokyo to sell yen in the market. On Thursday, Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said he would \"extremely closely watch currency-market movements with great interest,\" and that the government \"will take appropriate action while closely monitoring economic developments.\" In the past, Japanese officials have used the term \"appropriate action\" as an indirect reference to currency-market intervention. In a statement, Bank of Japan governor Masaaki Shirakawa also expressed concerns over \"substantial fluctuations\" in exchange rates and stock markets. The International Monetary Fund officials joined the fray, saying that the yen's strength undermines Japan's export-dependent economic outlook and urged the central bank to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in easing monetary policy. \"We do see further yen appreciation as a downside risk to the outlook . . . and obviously, if the yen continues to appreciate, we would be concerned,\" Kenneth Kang, division chief for IMF's Asia and Pacific Department, said in an interview. --- Takashi Nakamichi, Tomoyuki Tachikawa and Ian Talley contributed to this article.

The move surprised traders and raised questions about China's intentions regarding its currency's direction. Some analysts suggested that the People's Bank of China may be attempting to create two-way movements in the yuan's value, allowing it to rise temporarily before potentially falling later.

        "title": "China's search for greener values",
        "original_text": "As the Beijing-based Asia environment correspondent for the Guardian, Jonathan Watts has reported on environmental issues in China for several years. His new book, When a Billion Chinese Jump, is a travelogue that tells the story of China's breakneck development and its consequences, from melting glaciers in Xinjiang and cancer villages in Henan, to dam projects in Sichuan and skyscrapers in Shanghai. Sam Geall: The urgency of China's environmental situation has struck many people in the past year or so, especially since the Copenhagen climate conference, but you have been writing this book for four years. How did you become convinced of the importance of this topic? Jonathan Watts: The book grew and it changed. Because the country is so big and changing so fast, I found that this kind of road-trip reporting was a good way to capture that dynamism. And I found myself writing more and more environmental stories – whether it was a protest against a proposed factory development; a pollution spill into a river; Beijing's air quality ahead of the Olympics; or the loss of another species. The subject almost chose itself. But if I had to choose one moment when it really hit me in the face – that the environment situation in China is a matter of global, species-wide concern – it would be the story of the [now-extinct] baiji dolphin. When I went out to report it, I didn't think it would be an epic story. It was only when I sat down and did the research and tried to put it in context, that I realised how incredibly significant the loss of something is after 20 million years – something that has been on the earth more than twice as long as humanity. That really hit me. The situation is still changing. When I started the book four years ago, everyone was talking about pollution – also perhaps about climate change, political systems and how they influence governance. But I found myself shooting at a moving target: as I looked more into the story my priorities changed, and the story changed. It's about pollution, climate change and one-party governance, but it's even more about consumption and biodiversity and the long-term trend of human development. This is not just about China. In a sense, China is extraordinarily unfortunate to be hitting this stage of development at this time in human history. SG: The book points to some of the deeper dynamics at play in China's response to the environmental situation. One is the tension between the Daoist tradition, with its desire to find harmony, and Confucian philosophy, with its tendency to impose order on the natural world. How did you find this shaped China's response to this stage of development? JW: Looking for a solution to the predicament we are in, of living unsustainably, the importance of values comes up again and again. The focus in China is mainly on science and technology, on hardware – on things that if you drop them will hurt your toe. The importance of values hasn't really kicked in, but it's absolutely essential. Where do you get these values? Clearly western values haven't stopped the west from screwing up the environment. So, it's worth looking to China's philosophical and cultural roots. One of the sub-themes of the book is an exploration of China's Daoist side. There have always been competing philosophies in China. It intrigued me that you can't really have a Daoist civilisation – it's almost an embrace and acceptance of the wild, of anarchy and chaos. Most of the time Confucianism has been the predominant philosophy, though there have been times that China is more Legalist. However, in Chinese history, you hear that some Mandarins were Confucians while working in their official positions, but when they went home they tended their gardens, or wrote poetry, and gave space to their Daoist sides. Maybe that's one of the secrets of Chinese civilisation and why it has lasted so long: that balance of the two sides. I spoke to the popular philosopher Yu Dan, who has made her name writing about Confucian ideas – which is very much in line with Party orthodoxy at the moment. She told me that she is more of a Daoist, but that she doesn't think \"China is ready for Daoism yet\". Certainly in the last 60 years, that Daoist side has faded. The trend has been to order things. SG: One ecological example you give is the contrast between the traditional irrigation system at Dujiangyan and the large-scale hydro-engineering project at the Zipingpu Dam, both in Sichuan province. JW: I was first in Dujiangyan around the time of the Sichuan earthquake in 2008, but it was only afterwards when I interviewed the environmental philosopher Tang Xiyang that I realised its significance. Tang is the one who says: \"If China is going to solve its problems, it needs more Daoism.\" He told me that if I wanted to see how that would work in practice, then I should look at Dujiangyan. It's an example of how things can be: they can last, they can endure – you can work with nature, rather than against it. This is the long-term view. The other type of development is brittle. The hydrological engineering solutions are very impressive – when I saw the Three Gorges Dam I was amazed and knocked out by what humans can do – but they create new instabilities, which build up. And China has learned this painfully in its history: the events of 1958 come up in the book – that height of human hubris, the sense that you can overcome nature and impose your will on nature. The Maoist view of nature hasn't gone completely. There are lots of questions being asked about it, but the mega-projects have a certain momentum. Even some of the projects I have seen completed in the last seven years are the fulfillment of Mao's dreams. The railway to Tibet, the south-to-north water diversion scheme, the Zipingpu Dam – these were all Maoist ideas. It's almost like Mao Zedong was the big dreamer, and now there is a government of implementers. But I don't think that old vision of conquering nature is as strong as it once was. At the exhibition centre at the Three Gorges Dam, there are no pictures of the current leaders, premier Wen Jiabao and president Hu Jintao. The top leaders of the country did not attend the topping-off ceremony for the dam. This suggests to me that there are reservations about the wisdom of that project and concerns about where it is going. SG: Do you think a new set of values is starting to take root? JW: I see a search for new values – a real yearning for new values – and a sense that solving environmental problems needs to be part of any new set of values. I don't see a clearly defined new ethos, or even the reinvention of an old ethos, that completely gets to the heart of this. There are causes for optimism – the growth of green NGOs, the increased coverage of environmental issues in the media – but these do not represent the prevailing ideology. However, China's history of the last 100 years is one of dramatic change, with some ideas catching on so quickly that it's almost terrifying. Whether it's the fervour of political revolution, or the fervour to make lots of money, the country has been able to make 180-degree turns. I have to hope that this might be the case with the environment. SG: So, could China become the world's first green superpower? I wanted to ask that question in this book. We are heading into a difficult 30 or 40 years for our species. We are over the limit already by just about every ecological measure. And yet our population is probably going to rise by another two billion in the next 40 years. We need to get through this rough period and over that 40-year hump: after that, populations should start to fall and there should be better technology and economic models too. But now, the country that is in the best position – and the worst position – is China. China is in the best position because its economy is growing so quickly that it does have a lot of resources. It's in the worst position because it's reached this supercharged phase of growth at a very unfortunate time in terms of the history of global development. China can't outsource its problems like other countries have been able to do. This is a country that has to reinvent itself. The big contrast between China and the United States, particularly in renewable energy for instance, is that China is trapped by momentum, it has to keep moving forward. By contrast, the US is trapped by inertia – it's trying to protect what it already has. This is also why China is in a better position to become a green superpower. SG: One intention of your book seems to be to introduce a note of scepticism amid much western optimism about China's ability to save the world economy. JW: There is still a widespread assumption that one model has proven itself again and again over the past 200 years: the get-rich-first, clean-up-later model. But what worked for Britain in the nineteenth century, for the US in the twentieth century and for Japan and South Korea in the late twentieth century, may not work for China, because of scale and because of timing. In a sense, Britain and China may prove to be bookends on this phase of development that will be seen as abnormal in the long-term scale of human development. Britain was one small country producing an awful lot of pollution and extracting and using resources unsustainably. At that point it didn't really have a great planetary impact, but then this moved to Europe, and to the US, and the number of countries that were unsustainable and producing too much got bigger and bigger. Meanwhile, the number of countries left to absorb the impacts gets smaller and smaller. Where does China dump its waste? How does China extract enough from the rest of the world to provide for its people? I believe this is where economic development hits an ecological wall. The environment and the economy, which used to run pretty much in parallel, have become so detached from one another. The economists, the governments and the corporations all think the solution to the world's problems is more consumption in China, whereas the environmentalists are all saying: be careful what you wish for. If there is to be any solution, it is in the reattachment of economy and environment. China is moving in the right direction with its recently discussed ecological compensation scheme: this would require that economically rich parts of China, like Beijing, Shanghai or Guangzhou, pay the ecologically rich parts of China, like Yunnan, Heilongjiang and Guangxi, for \"environmental services\". This means directly giving a value to forests because they absorb carbon, or wetlands because they absorb pollution. This would mean that a laptop would become more expensive, but the price would be at a much more realistic level in terms of reflecting ecological limits and what things are really worth – which brings us back to the importance of values.

        "debiased_text": "Jonathan Watts, the Beijing-based Asia environment correspondent for the Guardian, has covered environmental issues in China for several years. His new book, When a Billion Chinese Jump, is a travelogue that explores various aspects of China's rapid development and its environmental consequences, including melting glaciers in Xinjiang, pollution-related health issues in Henan, dam projects in Sichuan, and urban construction in Shanghai. Sam Geall asked Jonathan Watts how he became convinced of the importance of the topic. Jonathan Watts explained that the book evolved over time as he covered a range of environmental stories, including protests against factory developments, pollution spills, air quality in Beijing before the Olympics, and the loss of species. He noted that the loss of the baiji dolphin, which became extinct during his research, had a significant impact on him, highlighting the importance of the subject. He described the situation as dynamic, with the focus shifting over time from pollution and climate change to issues of consumption and biodiversity. He also mentioned the influence of one-party governance on the environmental situation in China. Sam Geall inquired about the influence of traditional Chinese philosophies. Jonathan Watts discussed the tension between the Daoist tradition, emphasizing harmony with nature, and the Confucian philosophy, which often seeks to impose order on the natural world. He emphasized the importance of values in addressing environmental issues, pointing out that China's focus has been on science and technology rather than on philosophical or cultural values. He mentioned that while western values have not prevented environmental damage, there is potential to look to China's traditional philosophies for solutions. He cited the example of the traditional Dujiangyan irrigation system as a model of working with nature, in contrast to the Zipingpu Dam, a large-scale hydro-engineering project. He also discussed the influence of Maoist ideas on current projects, such as the railway to Tibet, the south-to-north water diversion, and the Zipingpu Dam. He noted that the Three Gorges Dam exhibition center did not feature current leaders, suggesting possible reservations about the project. Jonathan Watts expressed cautious optimism about the potential for new values to emerge in China and suggested that the country could become a green superpower due to its economic growth and position in the world. He also discussed the possibility of an ecological wall being reached with current levels of economic development and environmental impact, and highlighted China's proposed ecological compensation scheme as an example of reattaching economy and environment.

        "original_text": "BEIJING -- Several state-run Chinese banks have ordered some branches to suspend new lending for the rest of this month, suggesting a coordinated effort by Beijing to manage state banks' torrid lending in the year's first few weeks. A person with direct knowledge of the matter said Tuesday that Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the country's biggest lender by assets, on Friday ordered its branches in Beijing not to issue any new loans for the rest of January. China Citic Bank Corp. also suspended new lending in Shanghai last week because local operations had met their monthly quota for new loans in the city, a Shanghai-based bank official said Tuesday. The official said China's central bank \"told us to control the pace of lending this year.\" The moves by the two state-owned banks follow similar steps taken last week by state-run Bank of China Ltd. It remains unclear how severely China will continue to curb credit flows as it winds down the bank-led stimulus program that helped it weather the global slowdown. Chinese banks, which traditionally rush out loans at the start of the year, issued more than one trillion yuan ($146 billion) in new loans in 2010's first two weeks, Chinese media reported. That is a big chunk of the 7.5 trillion yuan that China's banking regulator said last week it expected to be lent this year. Some economists said Beijing was attempting to smooth the flow of credit throughout the year. \"You can't come to a point [toward year-end] where you ask banks to stop lending entirely,\" said Standard Chartered economist Stephen Green. \"This is just policing of the quota.\"",
        "debiased_text": "BEIJING -- Several state-run Chinese banks have instructed some branches to halt new lending for the remainder of January, indicating a coordinated approach by Beijing to manage lending activity during the initial weeks of the year. According to a source familiar with the situation, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the largest bank in the country by assets, directed its Beijing branches not to issue any new loans for the rest of the month on Friday.

These actions by the state-owned banks follow similar measures taken last week by Bank of China Ltd. It is still uncertain how aggressively China will continue to restrict credit flows as it transitions away from a bank-led stimulus program that supported the economy during the global slowdown. Historically, Chinese banks tend to issue a significant volume of new loans at the beginning of the year, with over one trillion yuan ($146 billion) issued in the first two weeks of 2010, according to Chinese media reports. This amount represents a substantial portion of the 7.5 trillion yuan that China's banking regulator projected for new loans this year. Some economists have suggested that Beijing is attempting to distribute credit more evenly throughout the year.

        "title": "China Trade and American Jobs; China Trade and American Jobs",
        "original_text": "President Obama's goal of creating American jobs has thrust the Chinese currency onto center stage in Washington, where an undervalued renminbi is blamed for the trade deficit with China, and the deficit is blamed for U.S. job losses. Growing acceptance of that sequence of fallacies threatens our economy, as Congress considers restrictions on imports from China to compel the Chinese government to appreciate its currency. In true Washington fashion, these policies will reduce Americans' real incomes and destroy U.S. jobs in the name of economic growth and job creation. Although the Chinese currency appears to be undervalued, the evidence suggests that appreciation will not reduce the bilateral trade deficit. Between July 2005 and July 2008 the renminbi rose 21% against the dollar, to $.1464 from $.1208, where it had been pegged since 1997. But the trade deficit, according to the trade statistics compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau, nevertheless increased to $268 billion from $202 billion over that period. Textbooks say that the Chinese should increase purchases of American products when the renminbi's value increases against the dollar -- and indeed they did by $28.4 billion. But exports to China were already increasing rapidly before the currency began to appreciate, rising by $19 billion between 2002 and 2005, according to the Census Bureau. Textbooks also predict that Americans will reduce their purchases of Chinese products in response to an appreciating renminbi. But U.S. imports from China between 2005 and 2008 actually increased by a whopping $94.3 billion, or 39%. Import value is measured officially as price times quantity. If price rises by a larger percentage than the quantity demanded decreases, then import value is going to rise -- adding to the deficit. And Americans did not reduce their consumption of Chinese goods at all in response to the stronger renminbi. That suggests a high degree of price-inelasticity. Consumers will endure higher prices with respect to products for which there are perceived to be few substitutes. This means that forcing China to appreciate its currency through sanctions will impose higher prices on American consumers, thereby reducing Americans' real incomes. Higher prices at Wal-Mart and Target -- two of the biggest retailers that bring Chinese goods to U.S. customers -- will be felt especially hard by lower-income Americans. Trade sanctions would in effect amount to a regressive tax. There is another explanation for Americans' continued purchases of Chinese goods despite their weaker dollars. A stronger renminbi increases the purchasing power of Chinese producers, who rely heavily on imported raw materials, capital equipment and components for their production. Because the inputs are now cheaper, Chinese producers can lower their export prices to preserve market share abroad. The relationship between currency and the trade deficit is weaker than policy makers presume. Weaker still is the relationship between the trade deficit and U.S. job loss. Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) and others on Capitol Hill attribute 2.4 million American job losses between 2001 and 2008 to the bilateral trade deficit. This figure comes from the union-backed Economic Policy Institute. EPI's methodology is not taken seriously by most economists because it approximates job gains from export value and job losses from import value, as though there were a straight line correlation between the figures. And it pretends that imports do not create or support U.S. jobs. But U.S. producers -- purchasing raw materials, components and capital equipment -- account for more than half of the value of U.S. imports annually, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Those imports support U.S. jobs in a wide range of industries. Furthermore, according to the results from a growing field of research, only a fraction of the value of U.S. imports from China represents the cost of Chinese labor, materials and overhead. Most of the value of those imports comes from components and raw materials produced in other countries, including the U.S. In a 2006 paper, Stanford University economist Lawrence Lau found that Chinese value-added accounted for about 37% of the total value of U.S. imports from China. In 2008, using a different methodology, U.S. International Trade Commission economist Robert Koopman, along with economists Zhi Wang and Shang-jin Wei, found the figure to be closer to 50%. In other words, despite all the hand-wringing about the value of imports from China, one-half to nearly two thirds of that value is not even Chinese. Instead, it reflects the efforts of workers and capital in other countries, including the U.S. In overstating Chinese value by 100% to 200%, the official U.S. import statistics are a poor proxy for job loss. Seldom noted in the union-controlled discussion of trade on Capitol Hill is that the jobs of large numbers of American workers depend on imports from China. The proliferation of transnational production and supply chains has joined higher-value-added U.S. manufacturing, design, and R&D activities with lower-value manufacturing and assembly operations in China. According to a widely cited 2007 study by Greg Linden, Kenneth L. Kraemer and Jason Dedrick of the University of California, Irvine, each Apple iPod costs $150 to produce. But only about $4 of that cost is Chinese value-added. Most of the value comes from components made in other countries, including the U.S. Yet when those iPods are imported from China, where they are snapped together, the full $150 is counted as an import from China, adding to the trade deficit and inflating EPI's job-loss figures. In reality, those imported iPods support thousands of U.S. jobs up the value chain -- in engineering, design, finance, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, retail and elsewhere. A 25% tariff on imports from China would penalize the non-Chinese companies and workers who create most of the iPod's value. Consider how many fewer iPods Apple would sell; how many fewer jobs iPod production, distribution and sales would support; how much lower Apple's profits and research and development expenditures would be; how much smaller the markets for music and video downloads, car accessories, jogging accessories, and docking stations would be; and how many fewer jobs those industries would support. Multiply that by the hundreds of other devices and gadgets, computers and Blu-Rays, and other products designed in the U.S. and assembled in China from components made in the U.S. and elsewhere. Those are the economic costs that Congress and the president would inflict by imposing trade sanctions on imports from China. --- Mr. Ikenson is associate director of the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies.",
        "debiased_text": "The topic of the Chinese currency has become a focus in Washington, particularly in relation to the U.S. trade deficit with China and concerns about job losses in the United States. Some in Congress are considering import restrictions from China in an attempt to influence the government to increase the value of the renminbi. However, despite the perception that the renminbi is undervalued, data indicates that between July 2005 and July 2008, the currency appreciated by 21% against the dollar, rising from $.1208 to $.1464. During the same period, the U.S. trade deficit with China increased from $202 billion to $268 billion. While U.S. exports to China rose by $28.4 billion during this time, the increase in imports rose by $94.3 billion, or 39%. The trade deficit increased despite the appreciated renminbi, suggesting that the association between currency appreciation and trade deficit reduction may not be as straightforward as commonly believed.\n\nAccording to economic research, the fraction of U.S. imports from China that reflects Chinese value-added is less than the total value listed in import statistics. A 2006 paper by Stanford University economist Lawrence Lau estimated that Chinese value-added accounted for about 37% of the total value of U.S. imports from China. In 2008, a study by Robert Koopman, Zhi Wang, and Shang-jin Wei found that Chinese value-added was closer to 50% of the total import value.

However, the methodology used by the union-backed Economic Policy Institute, which is the source of this figure, is not generally accepted by economists. The approach involves assuming a direct correlation between import and export values and job creation or loss, which may oversimplify the complex relationship between trade and employment. Additionally, the methodology fails to account for the fact that a large portion of U.S. imports from China support U.S. jobs in industries that provide inputs for the production process, including raw materials, components, and capital equipment.\n\nThe integration of global supply chains has brought together U.S. high-value manufacturing, design, and research and development activities with lower-value manufacturing and assembly operations in China. According to a 2007 study by researchers from the University of California, Irvine, the production of an Apple iPod involves a total cost value of $150, but only about $4 of that cost is derived from China. Most of the value comes from components made in other countries, including the U.S. However, in the official trade statistics, the full $150 is recorded as an import from China, which contributes to the trade deficit and may misrepresent the actual economic impact.\n\nThe imposition of tariffs on imports from China could result in negative economic effects for U.S. companies and workers who are involved in the production and distribution of such goods. For example, a 25% tariff on imports like the iPod could lead to fewer sales, reduced job support across multiple industries, lower profits, reduced investment in research and development, and diminished markets for associated products such as music and video downloads, car accessories, and docking stations. These consequences could be extended to numerous other products that are designed in the U.S. and assembled in China from components manufactured elsewhere."

Management at NFCA Mining, a unit of China Nonferrous Metals Corp., gave the workers 48 hours to appeal, said the official with the National Union of Miners and Allied Workers. Chinese-owned mine enterprises in Zambia have had stormy relations with local workers in recent years. In 2006, Chinese managers at Chambishi shot six miners during a wage protest. Last year, at least 13 Zambian coal miners were shot by their Chinese managers at the Collumn Coal Mine. The latest development is likely to put Chinese-owned companies on a collision course with Zambia's new president, Michael Sata, who is a strong critic of Chinese involvement in the country's mining sector.

Workers at Chinese-owned mines in the country continue to agitate for improved conditions and higher wages. Workers at the Chinese-owned Sino Metals Copper Plant and the Chambishi Coppet Smelter have all struck in the past few days. The Chambishi strike was the second this month at the 65,000-metric-tons-a-year copper mine. After a previous six-day strike, the government directed management to raise miners' pay to put them on a par with their counterparts at mines run by Vedanta Resources PLC's and Glencore International AG. However, the management has declined to comply, according to union officials, and the miners resumed striking Tuesday, demanding a 100% pay rise. Zambia local media quoted NFCA Chief Executive Wang Changai as saying the company had lost at least 1,500 metric tons of copper production as a result of the strike. Chinese-owned companies have invested at least $2 billion in Zambia in the past few years, creating around 20,000 jobs.

        "original_text": "Complaints forum ; Four cities are trying a virtual way of handling citizen dissatisfaction, write Rahul Jacob and Zhou Ping The scene may have resembled a cartoon or an online virtual world, but it was actually a 21st century makeover of one of China's oldest traditions - the petitioning system. Four cities in the southern province of Guangdong this week created experimental online forums for citizens to raise complaints. The virtual petition offices - staffed by officials represented by cartoon figures - for the first time allowed citizens to watch officials handle cases. The experiment was so popular that almost 25,000 watched the first three webcasts. In one, Xu Shaohua, a provincial official, \"met\" a female petitioner in the industrial city of Dongguan who complained that the highway from Shenzhen to Guangzhou, which runs past her house, lacked sound barriers. Peng Peng, a member of the Guangdong Academy of Social Sciences, says the innovation was \"more direct and visual\" than sending petition letters. He says that, while it would \"help build people's trust\", the effort was partly directed at reducing dissatisfaction with local governments and complaints to higher authorities. Every Chinese provincial capital has a petition office. Between them they receive several million complaints annually. When people feel they have not been fairly treated, they take their petition to the central government in Beijing. Zhou Zhanshun, the governor of the national petition office, says 80 per cent of the problems petitioners raise are reasonable and the vast majority should be resolved at the local level. However, plain-clothes security officials from the home provinces frequently detain petitioners so that the province's record is not blemished. Last week, a tourist from Henan province was illegally detained and beaten unconscious by these officials who are known as \"interceptors\". Guangdong's moves to alter the petition system are being viewed as a novel attempt to improve communication between an authoritarian government and its increasingly restive citizens, but also as a ploy to reduce the number of complaints to the central government. In addition to the webcasts, the city of Guangzhou had three public meetings in August where senior officials met with thousands of petitioners in large halls and the practice is expected to continue later this year. Yuan Gang, of Peking university, says Wang Yang, Guangdong's party secretary, has used the fact that the word for \"petition\" in Chinese sounds like the phrase \"giving people a place to talk\" in an attempt to make the system more responsive. Despite Mr Wang's hopes, when several vice-mayors in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, met thousands of petitioners, the meetings, like those at the Beijing petition office, were fraught with dashed hopes and even despair. Sun Hong and his wife had queued from 2am to get into one of the August meetings. The elderly man says he was pursuing a case of illegal detention in 2008 when he was bundled into a car and held for six days after he lost a business fraud case in which, he alleges, government officials were involved. For politically sensitive cases like Mr Sun's, the new petition mindset is similar to the old one. Even though he was among the first 40 people to queue, by early afternoon he had still not met an official. For his wife, the futile wait distilled years of disillusionment. \"My parents used to be party cadres who helped build this country,\" she says. \"I can scarcely believe this is the country they devoted themselves to. How can they treat us like this?\" Dark side of the petition system, www.ft.com/video",
        "debiased_text": "Four cities in the southern province of Guangdong have implemented experimental online forums to address citizen complaints. These virtual petition offices feature officials represented by cartoon figures and allow citizens to observe how officials handle cases. The experiment gained significant attention, with nearly 25,000 people viewing the first three webcasts. One of the webcasts featured Xu Shaohua, a provincial official, engaging with a petitioner from the industrial city of Dongguan who raised concerns about the lack of sound barriers on a highway that runs near her home. Peng Peng, a member of the Guangdong Academy of Social Sciences, noted that the innovation provides a more direct and visual method for addressing grievances, potentially enhancing public trust and reducing the need for complaints to be directed at higher authorities. Every provincial capital in China has a petition office, which collectively receives several million complaints each year. When individuals feel they have not been treated fairly, they often take their petitions to the central government in Beijing. Zhou Zhanshun, the governor of the national petition office, stated that approximately 80 per cent of the problems raised by petitioners are reasonable and should be resolved locally. However, plain-clothes security officials from the home provinces occasionally detain petitioners to prevent negative records from being submitted to the central government. Last week, a tourist from Henan province was detained and injured by these officials, who are commonly referred to as 'interceptors'. Guangdong's actions to modify the petition system are seen as an attempt to improve communication between the government and its citizens, as well as a strategy to minimize the number of complaints reaching the central government. In addition to online forums, Guangzhou held three public meetings in August where senior officials met with thousands of petitioners in large halls, and this practice is expected to continue later in the year. Yuan Gang of Peking University mentioned that Wang Yang, the party secretary of Guangdong, has utilized the similarity in sound between the word for 'petition' and the phrase 'giving people a place to talk' to encourage a more responsive system. During the August meetings in Guangzhou, similar to those in Beijing, many petitioners left with unmet expectations. Sun Hong and his wife attended one of these meetings after queuing from 2 am. Sun Hong was seeking resolution for an alleged case of illegal detention in 2008, which occurred after he lost a business fraud case where he claims government officials were involved. Despite being among the first 40 to arrive, Sun Hong had not met with an official by early afternoon. His wife expressed deep disappointment with the process, reflecting on her parents' history as party cadres who contributed to the country's development."

        "original_text": "Police have told cafes, hotels and other businesses in central Beijing to install surveillance technology for Wi-Fi users or face fines and possible closure, in a further tightening of internet controls. China has the world's largest and most sophisticated web censorship and monitoring system, which it has tightened still further after the Middle Eastern uprisings. Measures included blocking major virtual private networks, which allow people to evade internet controls. The new software, which costs about 20,000 yuan (£1,900), allows officials to check the identities of users and monitor their activity. Businesses that fail to comply face a fine of the same size and could have their licences revoked. Strict controls already apply at internet cafes, which poorer people rely on for access. It is unclear how strictly the measures will be enforced, and it appears that only Dongcheng district has told owners of the regulations. A staff member at its internet security unit said the initiative was city-wide, but Beijing police headquarters had not responded to a faxed query at time of writing. The Dongcheng police officer added: \"This regulation is made to enhance internet security and to assist public security bureaux to break criminal cases. Details of implementation are confidential.\" According to the New York Times, a notice from the district office said the measure would tackle offenders seeking to \"conduct blackmail, traffic goods, gamble, propagate damaging information and spread computer viruses\". \"This is undoubtedly an invasion of Wi-Fi users' privacy,\" said Jason Chen, a 22-year-old Beijing resident. \"We have already felt the restriction on university campuses, since they have always been monitored. But this time, the control is stretching to cafes and people's feeling of violation is sharper. If cafes cancel their Wi-Fi I will care a lot, and I believe young people will react strongly.\" Some venues in Dongcheng complained they were already losing custom after cutting off Wi-Fi. \"It is just unbelievable. Customers are not happy either,\" said Leona Zhang, manager of the Contempio bar. \"Some owners simply think this is for the public security bureaux to make money from us. The charge is the same regardless of size, even for small ones with only two or three tables.\" Businesses in other parts of Beijing said they had not heard of the measure. \"If the regulation was implemented here, it would struggle to be accepted. The cost is too high,\" said a worker at the New Seven Day Bar in Haidian. \"Furthermore, there is also the privacy of our customers to protect.\"",
        "debiased_text": "Authorities in central Beijing have instructed cafes, hotels, and other businesses to install surveillance technology for Wi-Fi users, with non-compliance potentially resulting in fines or closure. This move is part of ongoing efforts to enhance internet security and monitoring. In recent years, China has expanded its internet censorship and monitoring framework, particularly following events in the Middle East. As part of these measures, major virtual private networks (VPNs) have been blocked. The new software, which costs approximately 20,000 yuan (£1,900), enables officials to verify the identities of users and monitor their online activities. Businesses that fail to comply with the requirement could be fined the same amount and face the revocation of their operating licenses. Internet cafes, which are often used by individuals with limited access to personal devices, have already been subject to strict monitoring regulations. The extent to which these new measures will be enforced remains unclear, as only the Dongcheng district has reportedly communicated these regulations to business owners. A staff member from the district's internet security unit stated that the initiative is intended to be city-wide, but Beijing police headquarters had not responded to a faxed inquiry at the time of the report. The Dongcheng police officer mentioned that the regulation aims to enhance internet security and assist public security authorities in investigating criminal cases, adding that implementation details are confidential. According to a notice from the district office, the measure is designed to address activities such as blackmail, illegal trading, gambling, dissemination of harmful information, and the spread of computer viruses. Some residents have expressed concerns about privacy, with one individual noting that similar monitoring has already been present on university campuses but that the extension to cafes has increased the perception of intrusion. Venues in Dongcheng have reported challenges, including a loss of customers after discontinuing Wi-Fi services. A manager at the Contempio bar stated that some business owners perceive the regulation as a means for public security authorities to generate revenue, citing that the fee is the same regardless of the size of the venue. Businesses in other areas of Beijing indicated they had not received information regarding the measure. A worker at the New Seven Day Bar in Haidian expressed concerns over the high cost and the need to protect customer privacy."

        "original_text": "A communist official tipped as a future leader of China is moving to defuse a wave of protests in Inner Mongolia by choking information, tightening campus controls and promising to reform the mining industry. A demonstration by ethnic Mongolians on Monday in the regional capital, Hohhot, was the latest test for Hu Chunhua, whose appointment as party chief of the resource-rich region last year was widely seen as a step towards top office in 2020. Censors have blocked information about the biggest surge of unrest that the northern region has experienced in 20 years, with witnesses and rights groups claiming to have seen rallies in at least six communities over the past week. The protests were sparked by the killing of a Mongolian herder who tried to stop a convoy of coal trucks from trespassing on the grasslands. The case has become a symbol of unease about economic development that is marginalising ethnic rights and the steppe environment. Locals told the Guardian the latest protests took place on Mondayin Hohhot despite tightened security. \"It was about 20 Mongolians in Xinhua Square,\" said a blogger, who goes under the name Blue Sky Pigeon. \"But I doubt it will last long because the controls are tight.\" An employee at a hotel on the square confirmed a demonstration was taking place, but it was unclear how the security forces responded. The local police, government and propaganda offices either refused to comment or let phones ring unanswered, but the authorities have been working for several days to quash dissent with a mix of restrictions and conciliatory gestures. After 1,000 students took to the streets in Xilinhot last Wednesday, paramilitary police are reportedly stationed at the gates of Inner Mongolia University in Hohhot and checking the identities and intentions of everyone going in and out. In other areas, schools associated with both Mongolian and Han ethnic groups have been subject to restrictions. The Youth League Committee of Inner Mongolia University declined to discuss the new security measures, but acknowledged the students' online bulletin board and chatroom – known as Qizhi – had been shut down for \"maintenance\" until 10 June. Other reports suggest popular social networking sites such as QQ, Weibo and Tencent have been either blocked or heavily censored. A Chinese language internet search for \"Inner Mongolia\" and \"protest\" yielded no mention of the events of the past week. Hotels near universities and schools have been forbidden from accepting foreign guests since last Friday. \"The security has become tougher,\" said a taxi driver in Xilinhot, the site of an earlier disturbance. Hu – a protege of president Hu Jintao (though no relation) – has tried to pacify the protesters with a promise of justice for the perpetrators of the killing of the herder – known as Mergen – on 11 June, and another death related to a coalmine protest four days later. Recent incidents \"have triggered a great deal of public anger\", Hu told teachers and students last week, according to the Inner Mongolian Daily. \"We will firmly protect the dignity of law and the rights of the victims and their families.\" Local TV stations, which are controlled by the communist party, have shown Hu's deputy visiting Mergen's family to present a bundle of money. The chairman of the coal trucking company Liaoning Chuncheng Industry has also made a public apology. Police have arrested four people. The official Xinhua News Agency said regional authorities would investigate the mining industry's impact on the environment and traditional livelihoods with the aim of improving the protection of grasslands. But many locals remain suspicious. Mongolian independence activists said concilliatory words could not disguise the long-term trends of resource exploitation that prompted the fatal clash between truckers and herders. \"Mongols have good reasons to doubt the intentions of the government. For the past six decades, the destruction of the grassland ecology, cultural assimilation, political oppression and economic exploitation have characterised the policies of the Chinese government in southern Mongolia,\" said a group calling itself the \"Co-ordinating Committee for May 29/30 Protest\". If the protests continue, \"Little Hu\" (as the Inner Mongolian governor is nicknamed) may rely more on coercion and intimidation to impose order on a restless ethnic minority. There are precedents, including the crackdown imposed in Tibet by the current president Hu Jintao in the 1980s. Recent mobile phone messages from the Inner Mongolian authorities have warned that the police are ready to \"intensify the crackdown\", according to Reuters. Amnesty International has urged restraint and called on the authorities to \"respect freedom of expression and assembly for protesters\". Monday's relatively small demonstration, however, suggests Hu's efforts to silence, intimidate and buy-off critics may be working.",

If the protests persist, the governor, referred to as 'Little Hu' by some, may turn to more coercive measures to restore order. There have been past instances of similar crackdowns, including the actions taken in Tibet during the 1980s under the leadership of current president Hu Jintao. Recent messages sent via mobile phones from Inner Mongolian authorities have indicated that the police are prepared to 'intensify the crackdown,' Reuters reported. Amnesty International has called for restraint and urged the authorities to respect the freedom of expression and assembly for the protesters. The relatively small scale of the demonstration on Monday suggests that Hu's measures to suppress, intimidate, and provide incentives to critics may be having an effect."

The deputy premier, who is on a visit to Spain, Germany and the UK, also pledged that China would continue to \"play an active role\" on the international financial markets and stressed the country's continued support for the euro and European integration.

German officials earlier said it was possible that Angela Merkel, the chancellor, who is to meet Mr Li today, could use the talks to find out more about Beijing's plans to buy eurozone government bonds. The man widely tipped to become Chinese prime minister in the next few years said in his speech that Beijing would \"pursue a much more active policy of openness\" to import \"leading technologies, management expertise, highly skilled labour and capital\". He told an audience which included Peter Loescher, Siemens chief executive, and Dieter Zetsche, Daimler chief executive, that Beijing would \"support the liberalisation and simplifying of trade and investment\". \"By 2020, China will in large parts have completed its industrialisation and will see the size of its domestic market leading the world rankings,\" Mr Li said in a speech to which the Financial Times was invited by senior officials.

        "original_text": "[Financial Analysis and Commentary] China's property sector is a larger but less worrisome animal than its U.S. cousin. In 2010, investment in residential real estate accounted directly for 12% of China's gross domestic product, up from 10% in 2009 and a record. Throw in demand for construction material, and real estate's contribution is even larger. By contrast, the peak of spending on U.S. residential investment in 2005 was equal to just 6% of GDP. A larger role for real estate in the Chinese economy means the consequences of a bust should be more serious than in the U.S. And recent years offer a worrying precedent. A crackdown on speculation saw growth in real-estate investment fall from 31% a year at the end of 2007 to 3% at the beginning of 2009. The hit to construction spending, as much as the fall in exports, crunched China's GDP growth to a decade low of 6.5%. At first sight, history appears ready to repeat itself as prices run up sharply. The official house-price data tend to underestimate changes. But data from Soufun Holdings, which runs China's leading property website, show average prices in first-tier cities like Beijing and Shanghai rising considerably faster than disposable incomes. Meanwhile, breakneck construction in 2009 and 2010 has created an overhang of supply -- including the ghost blocks of high-end residential apartments bought for speculative purposes that loom large in the bears' arguments. The government continues to clamp down on speculators. That double whammy will at some point bring the price surge to an end and take the wind out of real-estate developers' sails. But when private investment fell away in 2008, there was nothing to take its place. This time round, the government plans a huge investment in affordable housing. The thin margins available in affordable construction are cold comfort for listed developers, but plans to build 10 million new budget residences in 2011 should to an extent cushion China's economy from a sharp slowdown in private-sector construction. In the U.S., post-crash housing is still weighed down by overbuilding in certain hot spots. In China, urbanization and rising wages mean most construction is better underpinned by demand. And houses are generally paid for with cash, not credit. In the U.S., mortgage debt reached 103% of GDP in 2007. In China, long-term loans to households, a proxy for mortgage borrowing, is 16% of GDP. Even throwing in loans to real-estate developers and a share of loans to local government investment vehicles -- some of which are invested in property -- takes the total only to 50%. A slowdown in prices, if not an outright decline in some cities, is a distinct possibility. That will hurt private developers. A sharp enough correction will cause the banks pain and hit consumer confidence and spending. But it shouldn't signal economic disaster as it did in the U.S.",

In comparison, the peak of U.S. residential investment in 2005 was equal to 6% of GDP. The larger role of real estate in the Chinese economy suggests that a downturn in the sector may have more significant consequences than in the U.S. Recent years demonstrate a precedent, as a crackdown on speculation led to a decline in real estate investment growth from 31% annually at the end of 2007 to 3% at the beginning of 2009. This reduction in construction spending, along with a decrease in exports, contributed to a decade-low GDP growth rate of 6.5% in China. Recent data indicates that house prices in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai have been rising at a rate faster than disposable incomes. This trend is supported by data from Soufun Holdings, a leading property website operator in China. Additionally, rapid construction during 2009 and 2010 created a surplus of housing supply, including some high-end residential apartments that were purchased primarily for speculative reasons. The government continues to impose restrictions on speculative activities. This combination of factors may eventually bring an end to the recent price increase and affect real estate developers. In 2008, when private investment declined, there was no alternative to replace it. This time, the government has announced plans for a significant investment in affordable housing. While the low profit margins in affordable housing may not be comforting for listed developers, the plan to construct 10 million budget residences in 2011 could provide some relief to the economy by reducing the potential slowdown in private-sector construction. In the U.S., the housing market remains impacted by overbuilding in specific regions. In China, urbanization and increasing wages are expected to support construction demand. Additionally, housing purchases in China are typically made with cash, rather than credit, unlike in the U.S., where mortgage debt reached 103% of GDP in 2007. In China, long-term loans to households, which serve as a measure of mortgage borrowing, account for 16% of GDP. Even when including loans to real estate developers and a portion of loans to local government investment vehicles, some of which are used for property development, the total reaches 50% of GDP. A slowdown in housing prices, or a decline in certain cities, is a distinct possibility. This development could adversely affect private developers. A significant price correction may result in financial challenges for banks and negatively impact consumer confidence and spending. However, this situation is unlikely to lead to the same level of economic disruption observed in the U.S."

        "original_text": "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. trade deficit with China in June hit its highest level in nearly two years and could spur congressional pressure on Beijing to revamp its currency policy. America's trade deficit with China jumped 17% in June over the previous month to $26.2 billion, the biggest gap since October 2008. Earlier this week, China said its overall trade surplus hit $28.7 billion in July, an 18-month high. The Commerce Department figures could set the stage for a fight in Congress this fall over China's currency policy. Some lawmakers, arguing that China has set the yuan artificially low to make its exports more price competitive on global markets, are keen to pass laws that would penalize countries that are found to be manipulating their currencies. China, under pressure from the U.S. and other countries, announced a shift to a more-flexible exchange rate in June. But the yuan has appreciated less than 1% since then, and some economists say it remains undervalued against the dollar by at least 25%. While efforts to pass such legislation have made little headway, lawmakers and industry groups agree that the issue could gain traction in September, given that voters, who head to the polls in November, are angry about the country's continued weak economy and high unemployment rate. A number of bills have garnered bipartisan support, including measures promoted by Tim Ryan (D., Ohio) and Patrick Murphy (D., Pa.) in the House, and by Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) in the Senate. These efforts would, among other things, make it easier for companies to seek import duties on goods from countries designated as having undervalued currencies. The Ryan-Murphy bill has more than 127 co-sponsors, including 37 Republicans. Nadeam Elshami, a spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), said the House Ways and Means Committee would hold a hearing on the currency issue in September after Congress returns from summer recess. \"But no final decisions have been made on moving legislation forward,\" he said. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), a co-sponsor of the Schumer bill and a member of President Barack Obama's Export Council, wrote Mr. Obama on Aug. 4, urging the administration to take tougher measures to address \"unfairly subsidized exports\" by countries such as China. Ten other senators signed the letter, including Republicans Jim Bunning of Kentucky and Olympia Snowe of Maine. The Treasury Department on Wednesday declined to comment on the U.S.-China trade gap or China's currency policy. Business groups are expected to intensify their lobbying on the issue, although they differ over whether punitive legislation aimed at China's currency policy is the best solution for narrowing the U.S.-China trade gap. Augustine Tantillo, executive director of the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition, a Washington trade group representing U.S. manufacturers, says the group backs the Ryan-Murphy bill and is lobbying lawmakers, targeting those from Midwestern and Southeastern states with large manufacturing sectors and high unemployment. \"These trade surpluses aren't a result of happenstance,\" he said. \"We're hoping concerns about job creation and the fall election environment will finally give us an opportunity to bring the legislation to a vote.\" Erin Ennis, vice president for the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents U.S. companies doing business in China, said the window for China to \"show it was serious\" about addressing U.S. concerns about the yuan would close in September, when Congress returns to session. But while Ms. Ennis expected the Chinese currency policy to be a major issue in the fall, \"this isn't our member companies' top priority,\" she said. Rather, she said that Congress and the administration should focus on reducing barriers to China's market and on the country's new \"indigenous innovation\" policy, which many Western companies say unfairly favors Chinese companies by promoting domestic innovation.",

Erin Ennis, vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents U.S. companies operating in China, noted that the window for China to demonstrate its commitment to addressing U.S. concerns about the yuan would close in September when Congress reconvenes. While Ennis expected the Chinese currency policy to be a significant topic during the fall session, she emphasized it is not the top concern for the council's member companies. Instead, she suggested that efforts should focus on reducing market barriers in China and addressing its new 'indigenous innovation' policy, which is perceived by Western companies as giving unfair advantages to domestic firms."

Chinese copper inventories stood at 1.9m tonnes at the end of 2010, more than the US consumes in a year, according to estimates by the state-backed China Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Association. The estimate is significantly higher than the 1m-1.5m tonnes range that foreign executives have assumed in the past.

Movements in Chinese inventories are one of the most important price drivers for the global copper market. A buying spree in early 2009 by the country, which now accounts for about 40 per cent of global copper demand, helped trigger a price rally from the lows of the financial crisis to new records this year above $10,000 a tonne. The new stock estimates were presented at the last meeting of the ICSG, a group representing the governments of large copper-producing countries and consumers, in Lisbon at the end of September, according to several people who attended. The CNIA estimated that Chinese copper stocks, not including those kept at Shanghai Futures Exchange warehouses, stood at 1.768m tonnes at the end of 2010, up from 1.218m in 2009 and 282,000 in 2008. SHFE inventories were 132,000 tonnes in 2010, putting China's total stocks at 1.9m tonnes. However, analysts, investors and traders are sceptical, noting that the world's largest copper importer and consumer has an interest in inflating the size of its stockpiles, which could push prices down. The CNIA declined to comment. \"Whatever the Chinese say that stocks are, in the end they still need copper,\" said George Cheveley, metals and mining portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management. The ICSG has yet to incorporate the new estimates into its supply and demand data because some members questioned their accuracy. Additional reporting by Leslie Hook in Beijing Commodities, Page 28",
        "debiased_text": "China has for the first time disclosed the estimated size of its copper inventories, providing insight into a long-standing uncertainty in the commodity market. According to estimates from the state-backed China Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Association, Chinese copper inventories were at 1.9 million tonnes at the end of 2010, which is more than the annual consumption of the United States. This figure is notably higher than the previously assumed range of 1 million to 1.5 million tonnes by foreign industry executives. The figures were announced during a recent meeting of the International Copper Study Group, though they have not been made publicly available. These estimates suggest that actual Chinese copper demand may have been lower than previously believed in recent years. Inventory movements in China are a key factor influencing global copper prices. A significant buying period in early 2009 by China, which currently accounts for approximately 40 per cent of global copper demand, contributed to a price increase from the lows of the financial crisis to a record above $10,000 per tonne this year. The new stock estimates were presented at the ICSG's most recent meeting, held in Lisbon at the end of September, as reported by several attendees. The CNIA estimated that Chinese copper stocks, excluding those stored at Shanghai Futures Exchange warehouses, were 1.768 million tonnes at the end of 2010, compared to 1.218 million tonnes in 2009 and 282,000 tonnes in 2008. Shanghai Futures Exchange inventories stood at 132,000 tonnes in 2010, bringing China's total inventories to 1.9 million tonnes. Analysts, investors, and traders have expressed skepticism, noting that as the world's largest copper importer and consumer, China may have an incentive to overstate its stockpile levels, potentially affecting copper prices. The CNIA has not provided a comment on these estimates. George Cheveley, a metals and mining portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management, stated, 'Whatever the Chinese say about stock levels, they still require copper.' The ICSG has not yet included the new estimates in its supply and demand data, as some members have raised concerns about their accuracy. Additional reporting by Leslie Hook in Beijing."

        "original_text": "China's gold imports are estimated to have more than doubled from a year ago in the run-up to Chinese new year, putting the country on track to overtake India as the world's largest consumer of the precious metal. The growth in demand is being attributed by traders in part to Chinese families giving each other gifts of gold instead of traditional red envelopes filled with cash. Fears of inflation have also driven demand for gold as a retail investment. Precious metals traders in London and Hong Kong said they were stunned by the strength of Chinese buying in the last month. \"The demand is unbelievable. The size of the orders is enormous,\" said one senior banker, who estimated China imported about 200 tonnes in the past three months. Gold prices softened in January on the back of positive economic data in the US, but prices for physical gold in Shanghai have been at a premium of about $20 per troy ounce over those in London, underscoring the tightness in Asian markets. That spread fell to $4 on Wednesday because of slow trading during the new year. Official data show China importing 209 tonnes of gold the first 10 months of last year, versus 333 tonnes for India for the whole year. The Indian festival of Diwali was once the key driver of seasonal demand patterns because of the large number of weddings taking place during the holidays. But now, as India's gold demand has started to smooth out because of changing wedding habits, Chinese new year is starting to have a bigger impact. Last year roughly a third of Chinese gold consumption was linked to the holidays, according to a precious metals trader, but this year the spike is more pronounced. Gold gifts are more popular in China this year than ever, particularly rabbit-themed gold pieces to mark the year of the rabbit. Small bars of 100 ounces or less are elaborately engraved with auspicious rabbit idioms. A gold store in Tangshan, a mid-tier steel town near Beijing, was all but sold out of rabbit-themed products on a recent visit. With only days to go before the start of the holidays, the store clerk said all that was left was a 20-oz carved rabbit bar and a few leftover Bugs Bunny-style statuettes.",

However, as gold demand in India has become more consistent due to evolving wedding practices, the Chinese New Year is increasingly influencing demand patterns. Last year, about a third of China's gold consumption was linked to the holiday season, but this year the increase is more significant. Gold gifts have become more popular in China, especially rabbit-themed items to commemorate the Year of the Rabbit. Small gold bars of 100 ounces or less are often engraved with auspicious rabbit-related phrases. A gold store in Tangshan, a mid-sized steel town near Beijing, reported that it was nearly sold out of rabbit-themed products during a recent visit. With only days remaining before the start of the holidays, the store clerk mentioned that only a 20-ounce carved rabbit bar and a few remaining Bugs Bunny-style statuettes were left in stock."

        "original_text": "China said on Wednesday that it will levy duties on imports of some U.S.-made cars in retaliation for U.S. trade policies, the latest volley in an escalating trade spat between the world's two largest economies. Auto makers and industry observers said the move likely will have a limited impact on sales in China. But it threatened to stoke tensions between the two nations amid mounting U.S. concerns about slow job growth and overseas competition. China's action appeared to be a response to U.S. moves in the past year to challenge China's trade policies through the World Trade Organization, the international arbiter of trade disputes. It also served as a warning shot for the U.S., which is looking into American complaints about China flooding the world with low-price solar panels to beat back competition. The Obama administration was \"disappointed\" by China's announcement and would weigh options for responding, said Andrea Mead, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative. The administration has alleged that China's policies \"violate multiple WTO rules,\" she said. This week, China is celebrating the 10th anniversary of its entry into the WTO. The Obama administration, under pressure from Congress and U.S. businesses, is engaged in a long-running effort to press China to let its currency, the yuan, appreciate faster. That would help U.S. exporters who believe an undervalued yuan is hurting their competitiveness. Long before China's announcement Wednesday, U.S. lawmakers had threatened to push back against China on a host of issues, including the currency and what they view was unfair trade practices affecting U.S. solar-panel manufacturers. \"China's actions are unjustifiable, and unfortunately, this appears to be just one more instance of impermissible Chinese retaliation against the United States and other trading partners,\" four top House Republicans and Democrats who oversee trade issues said in a joint statement. China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that it will levy duties on imports from the U.S. of some vehicles with engine capacities above 2.5 liters made by several companies, including General Motors Co., Chrysler Group LLC and the U.S. arm of Honda Motor Co. The ministry alleged that these companies engage in dumping and subsidizing these vehicles -- selling them in overseas markets at a lower cost than at home. The ministry said the move would also affect cars made by the U.S. arms of Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz and BMW AG, though their level of dumping was smaller. The duties begin Thursday and will last two years. China's move served as a reminder that it has broad ambitions for its own auto industry that includes higher-end and higher-margin cars. Domestic manufacturers of sedans and sport-utility vehicles with engine sizes above 2.5 liters are \"materially threatened\" by imports from the U.S., the ministry said. The move is likely to make U.S.-made cars even more expensive in China, the world's largest auto market, where existing taxes and duties can add 25% or more to an imported vehicle's cost. Still, many auto makers won't be affected because they make much of what they sell in China domestically through joint ventures, according to analysts and the companies. Furthermore, the impact on higher-end cars could be softened by a lack of price sensitivity among the growing ranks of wealthy Chinese. GM, for instance, said the number of cars it imports into China is less than one-half of 1% of its domestic production in China. The company said it is working with its partners and authorities to gauge the impact of the move and to \"seek a solution consistent with a constructive global trade environment, which we believe is important to both China and the U.S.\"",
        "debiased_text": "China announced on Wednesday that it will impose duties on imports of certain U.S.-made vehicles as a response to U.S. trade policies. This action is part of the ongoing trade tensions between the two major economies. Industry experts and manufacturers indicated that the impact of this decision on sales within China is likely to be minimal. The announcement comes amid increasing U.S. concerns regarding slow job growth and international competition. China's decision appears to be a reaction to recent U.S. actions targeting Chinese trade practices through the World Trade Organization. It also coincides with investigations into American complaints about China's export of low-cost solar panels, which are seen as affecting competition in the U.S. market. A representative from the U.S. Trade Representative expressed disappointment with China's announcement and mentioned that the administration would consider possible responses. The administration has previously claimed that China's actions breach several WTO regulations. In addition, China is commemorating the 10th anniversary of its WTO membership this week. The U.S. administration, influenced by pressure from Congress and businesses, has been working to encourage China to allow the yuan to appreciate more rapidly, which is believed to benefit U.S. exporters. U.S. lawmakers had already indicated their intent to challenge China on various issues, including currency valuation and what they consider unfair trade practices impacting the U.S. solar-panel industry. Four senior members of the House of Representatives, including both Republicans and Democrats, who are responsible for trade matters, issued a joint statement stating that China's actions are unjustifiable and regrettable, and represent another instance of retaliatory measures by China against the United States and other trading partners. China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement confirming the implementation of duties on selected U.S. vehicles with engine capacities above 2.5 liters from several companies, such as General Motors Co., Chrysler Group LLC, and the U.S. division of Honda Motor Co. The ministry claimed that these companies engage in dumping and subsidizing, by selling vehicles in overseas markets at prices lower than in their domestic markets. The ministry also noted that the move would affect cars produced by the U.S. divisions of Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz and BMW AG, although the dumping activities were at a lower level. The duties will take effect on Thursday and are expected to remain in place for two years. The action highlights China's broader goals for its domestic auto industry, which aims to produce more high-end and higher-margin vehicles. The ministry stated that local manufacturers of sedans and sport utility vehicles with engine sizes above 2.5 liters are significantly threatened by U.S. imports. This decision is expected to increase the cost of U.S. vehicles in China, a major auto market, where existing taxes and duties can add up to 25% or more to the price of an imported car. However, many auto manufacturers are not expected to be severely impacted, as a large portion of their vehicles sold in China are produced through domestic joint ventures, according to analysts and the involved companies. For example, General Motors stated that the number of cars it imports into China constitutes less than half of 1% of its domestic production in China. The company added that it is collaborating with its partners and authorities to assess the impact of the measure and to pursue a resolution that aligns with a constructive global trade environment, which it believes is important for both China and the U.S."

        "title": "The Net Delusion: How Not to Liberate the World by Evgeny Morozov – review",
        "original_text": "On 21 January 2010, US secretary of state Hillary Clinton made a speech at the delightfully named Newseum – America's leading \"interactive museum of news\" – announcing \"internet freedom\" as a core foreign policy concern. \"Information freedom,\" she argued, \"supports the peace and security that provide a foundation for global progress.\" Evgeny Morozov has a blunt riposte to such ambitions: they smack of \"excessive optimism and empty McKinsey-speak,\" not to mention a \"creative use of recent history\". Morozov, a young Belarusian-born writer and researcher now based in the US, doesn't mince his words. But The Net Delusion is considerably more than an assault on political rhetoric; for, it argues, behind many of the fine words recently spoken in praise of technology lies a combination of utopianism and ignorance that grossly misrepresents the internet's political role and potentials. Unless we are very careful, he suggests, the democratising power of new media will in fact bring not democracy and freedom, but the entrenchment of authoritarian regimes. Two delusions in particular concern Morozov: \"cyber-utopianism\", the belief that the culture of the internet is inherently emancipatory; and \"internet-centrism\", the belief that every important question about modern society and politics can be framed in terms of the internet. Put so starkly, such extreme beliefs may sound laughable, yet he sees them in action everywhere: from the misguided belief that Twitter could foment revolution in Iran in 2009 (on the eve of the elections, the country had fewer than 20,000 Twitter users) to the naive hope that instant international exposure via new media will necessarily result in a diminishing of violence in Africa and the Middle East. Moreover, Morozov argues, the west's reckless promotion of technological tools as pro-democratic agents has provoked authoritarian regimes to crack down on online activity in some style: not just closing down or blocking websites, but using social networks to infiltrate protest groups and track down protesters, seeding their own propaganda online, and generally out-resourcing and out-smarting their beleaguered citizenry. One of Morozov's sharpest points is to highlight the self-cancelling asymmetry of the entire internet freedom agenda. Restrictions on internet use in China, for example, tend automatically to be treated in Washington as a government curbing the politically worthy activities of the country's freedom-loving citizens. Meanwhile, calls to restrict internet use in America or Europe mark the efforts of responsible governments to protect the minds of their Google-addled youth from offensive content, online scammers or worse. \"It's as if we can't ever imagine that Chinese or Russian parents, too, might have some valid concerns about how their kids spend their free time,\" Morozov notes. What we need, he argues, is to become \"cyber-realists\" – people able to \"make the internet an ally in achieving specific policy objectives\". It's a dry mantra for a passionate book, but an admirable and important one nonetheless. Thanks to the WikiLeaks affair, the western world may already have lurched some way towards this awareness since The Net Delusion was written. Freedom of information is no longer such a certain good in political rhetoric, and the web is losing its utopian lustre. We have seen one of Morozov's greatest concerns – that online political acts involve no commitment or risk, and are largely mediated by western corporations – addressed, with the emergence of a decentralised global protest movement prepared to take overtly political online actions and even, in a couple of cases at least, to make their identities known and face imprisonment for their beliefs. Morozov is on the most intriguing ground of all, however, when he steps into the debate over not only what new technology should or can do, but what \"the masses\" actually tend to use it for: entertainment and personal validation. Here, he joins a long and withering line of thinkers stretching back through Kierkegaard's critique of the \"irresponsible and uncommitted\" nature of newspapers to Plato's suspicion that writing itself damaged critical thought. The internet, Morozov argues, is breeding a generation not of activists but of \"slacktivists\", who think that clicking on a Facebook petition counts as a political act (the 1.7 million members of the \"Save the Children of Africa\" group have, for example, spent several years raising the princely sum of $12,000) and who dissipate their energies on a thousand distractions. Bread and circuses, it seems, are the most effective censorship technique of all. The wise dictator doesn't inflame his people's curiosity by banning websites. He gives them comfort, pornography and spectacle. In this sense, all of Morozov's arguments boil down to the same thing: a war against complacency. The masses are mired in dross – but the echo chambers of the elite are equally pernicious, as intellectuals travel the world from conference to book signing, chatting to each other about freedom while their native countries clamp down. There's an anguish here that emerges most clearly when Morozov talks about his native Belarus, where \"no angry tweets or text messages, no matter how eloquent, have been able to rekindle the democratic spirit of the masses, who, to a large extent, have drowned in a bottomless reservoir of spin and hedonism, created by a government that has read its Huxley\". Is this really what our brave new world amounts to? Morozov longs for the sacred light of reason to shine into the web's dark corners. But, as his own diagnosis suggests, politics has always been a matter for the passions. And if it's naive to think that the internet can save us, it's naive to think that it can damn us too. Here, his avowedly realist programme runs into idealistic trouble: for if the twinned, venal natures of man and media are to blame for our ills, there's not much we can do. This helps no one, and runs counter to his incisive anatomy of the issues at stake. For better and for worse, the world has arrived online – and duly busied itself looking at cute pictures of cats, building encyclopedias and distributing classified diplomatic cables. If there is hope, it lies exactly where Morozov himself seems most hopeless: in acknowledging and building on what it is that people actually fear, desire and believe in.",
        "debiased_text": "On 21 January 2010, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivered a speech at the Newseum, a museum dedicated to the interactive history of news, stating that internet freedom would become a central element of foreign policy. She emphasized that information freedom supports peace and security, which are essential for global progress. Evgeny Morozov, a Belarusian-born writer and researcher based in the US, criticized these statements as being based on excessive optimism and simplified language typically associated with corporate consulting. He further argues that such beliefs often ignore the complexities of the internet's role in politics and society. Morozov suggests that the push for internet freedom could have unintended consequences, potentially reinforcing rather than challenging authoritarian structures. He identifies two key misperceptions: 'cyber-utopianism,' which assumes the internet inherently promotes emancipation, and 'internet-centrism,' which frames all societal and political issues through the lens of internet technology. Morozov highlights that the United States and other Western countries have supported the spread of technology with the belief that it promotes democracy. This, he claims, has led to authoritarian governments responding by increasing control over online activities, such as blocking websites, using social networks for surveillance, and distributing propaganda. He also points out an imbalance in how internet restrictions are perceived. For instance, in China, internet limitations are often seen as diminishing freedom, yet in Western nations, similar restrictions are framing as responsible governance protecting citizens from harmful content. Morozov advocates for a more pragmatic approach, called 'cyber-realism,' which involves using the internet to achieve concrete policy goals. Since the publication of his book, the global perspective on the role of the internet in politics may have shifted, in part due to the WikiLeaks incident, which has challenged the notion of the internet as a neutral instrument for political change. He observes that people frequently use the internet for entertainment and personal validation rather than for political activism. For example, large online groups may have minimal actual impact in terms of tangible support. Morozov notes that authoritarian governments may be more effective in controlling their populations by offering distraction rather than by banning websites. He also discusses concerns about his home country, Belarus, where he suggests that online platforms have not been able to rekindle political engagement among the populace. Morozov's critique of the internet and its impact on political processes aims to combat excessive complacency. Despite this, he acknowledges that human nature and the characters of media are fundamental in shaping outcomes. The internet, he concludes, has brought both positive and negative aspects of human behavior into the global sphere, with the potential for real change lying in understanding and addressing the fears, desires, and beliefs of people worldwide."

        "title": "US debt and China: a tale of two deficits | Dean Baker",
        "original_text": "In the movie Philadelphia, the lawyer played by Denzel Washington is shown repeatedly telling his clients to explain their case to him as though he were a 9-year-old. This is a good rule to follow in explaining issues to economists and policy analysts, since they seem to get confused easily in discussing economics. One of the lines frequently repeated by the deficit hysterics is that if we don't get the deficit under control, then there could be a run from the dollar. This is a great line for getting little boys and girls and reporters at elite news outlets very scared. After all, the prospect of the dollar becoming worthless is pretty scary. One of the other lines pushed by this same crew is that we are borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars from foreigners, with the Chinese also being cited for special mention. The prospect of the Chinese holding trillions of dollars of US government debt is also scary to little boys and girls and reporters at elite news outlets. The problem with these two scary stories is that they actually are in direct contradiction to each other. The only plausible way that we can stop borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars a year from those nasty Chinese is by having the dollar fall in value against the currencies of our trading partners. This decline probably would not take the form of a scary run that ends in the dollar being worthless, but more likely a substantial and sustained decline that makes US goods much more competitive in international markets. The reason that we are borrowing from abroad every year is that the United States has a trade deficit of the order of $550bn a year, or just under 4% of GDP. This trade deficit is financed by foreign borrowings. The logic is simple. If the United States buys more than it sells, then it must borrow the difference. Note that this has nothing to do with the budget deficit. If the United States buys $500bn more from other countries than it sells to other countries, then it must borrow $500bn a year from them, regardless of whether the United States is running a budget surplus or a budget deficit. Foreign borrowing is determined by the trade deficit, end of story. There are two ways that reducing the budget deficit can affect this picture. First, cutting spending and/or raising taxes can slow the economy, as will likely be the result from the cuts recently pushed through by Congress. If the economy is smaller, then we will buy less of everything, including fewer imports. In other words, if cutting the deficit makes the downturn deeper, then we will have a lower trade deficit. This means that the deficit hawks can reduce our borrowing from bad guys – if their intention is to throw the economy into a severe and prolonged downturn. The other route through which reducing the fiscal deficit can lead to a lower trade deficit is if it results in a lower-valued dollar. The argument here is that if we get the deficit down, then interest rates would fall. Lower interest rates would make foreigners less interested in buying dollar-denominated assets, like US government bonds. If foreigners investors are less interested in buy dollar-denominated assets, then they have less need for getting dollars. The reduced demand for dollars would cause the value of the dollar to fall. A lower-valued dollar will then make US goods more competitive in international markets, leading us to buy fewer imports and to increase out exports. However, this channel for reducing the value of the dollar is not working right now, since many governments – most importantly, China's – are deliberately propping up the value of the dollar against their currencies. They are doing this to sustain their export markets in the United States. It is very difficult to see why China would be less interested in sustaining its export market in the United States if we reduced our budget deficit. Does anyone believe that President Hu is going to decide that China no longer needs its export market in the United States because we have reduced our budget deficit? Of course, this is absurd. China's decision to prop up the dollar is not going to be affected by the size of the US budget deficit. Which means that the US trade deficit and our borrowings from China are not going to be affected by the budget deficit. If we are interested in reducing our borrowings from China, then we should be focused on reducing the value of the dollar, not the budget deficit. So, why do all the deficit hawks talk about borrowing money from China? They do it for the same reason that George HW Bush talked about Willie Horton when he was running against Michael Dukakis. It works. The deficit hawks want the country to agree to take steps that are incredibly unpopular. They want the public to support the gutting of essential support programmes for the middle class like social security and Medicare. Naturally, this is a hard sell. Therefore, if it takes a little China bashing to make the policy go down easier, the deficit hawks are perfectly prepared to go that route. That's the way politics works in the United States.",

Another common claim is that the United States is borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars from foreign countries, with particular emphasis on China's role in holding trillions of dollars in US government debt. These narratives are sometimes presented as alarming to the general public and reporters. However, these two statements may be contradictory. The only plausible way to reduce the amount of borrowing from foreign countries, including China, is if the dollar's value declines against the currencies of trading partners. This decline may not result in the dollar becoming completely worthless but rather a sustained reduction, which could make US goods more competitive in international markets. The reason for foreign borrowing is the United States' trade deficit, which is approximately $550 billion annually, or close to 4% of GDP. This trade deficit is financed by foreign investments. This has no direct connection to the budget deficit. The trade deficit occurs when the United States imports more than it exports, and this requires borrowing from other countries, regardless của whether the budget is in surplus or deficit. Reducing the budget deficit may affect the trade deficit in two ways. First, reducing government spending and/or increasing taxes could slow down the economy. A slower economy may reduce the demand for imports, thereby lowering the trade deficit. Second, reducing the budget deficit might lead to lower interest rates, which could decrease the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets, such as US government bonds, to foreign investors. A reduced demand for dollars might cause the dollar's value to fall, making US goods more competitive internationally and potentially reducing the trade deficit. However, this second channel is not currently effective, as several governments, notably China, actively support the dollar's value against their own currencies to maintain their export markets in the United States. It is unlikely that China would change its stance on supporting the dollar if the US budget deficit were reduced Because the decision to prop up the dollar is motivated by maintaining export markets, not by the size of the budget deficit. This implies that US borrowing from China and the trade deficit are not directly influenced by the budget deficit. If the goal is to reduce borrowing from China, then the focus should be on the value of the dollar, not just on reducing the budget deficit. The reason some individuals focus on the issue of borrowing from China is that it may serve as a rhetorical strategy to gain public support for policies that are otherwise difficult to sell. These policies may include cuts to various support programs for the middle class, such as social security and Medicare. This strategy may be used to make such policies more palatable to the public, which is a common aspect of political discourse in the United States."

        "title": "Food prices: how high will they go by 2020?",
        "original_text": "Last week we showed how food prices have rocketed in the last decade. The question now is what will happen in the next one. The latest data, out today from the OECD and the UN's FAO, shows what the best estimates are of changing food prices over the next ten years. It works by looking at all the indicators, such as demand, how much we consume, how much it costs to transport the stuff and population growth. And what it shows makes grim reading. The key finding is that, although a good harvest will push prices down next year, the overall trend is updwards: Over the coming decade real prices for cereals could average as much as 20% higher and those for meats as much as 30% higher, compared to 2001-10 Although these projections are well below the peak price levels experienced in 2007-08 and again this year, this means higher food prices are becoming the norm. So, what is happening? (Download the data for these charts and much more) 1. Prices are going up All across the OECD, prices are rising, and fast. According to the report, from January 2010 to 2011, three-quarters of OECD countries experienced retail food prices increases of 5% or less, while in six they rose by over 5%. Two countries, Korea and Estonia, experienced increases of over 10%. Brazil, China, Indonesia, and the Russian Federation all had double digit rates of food inflation this past year. These rates represent a significant acceleration from the previous year of single digit inflation. For those other developing and least developed countries that were examined, a similar picture of accelerating food price inflation emerged. Nonetheless, a few countries continued to experience a slowing in price increases, these include Ghana and Kenya. In Rwanda, prices actually decreased by about 2% 2. Consumption is going up Because of population growth and rising incomes demand for commodities will be up in developing countries. It will be stagnant in the developed west, where more food is actually eaten per person. Developing regions also have the highest per capita income growth predicted. The OECD also predicts that as part of this, people will be consuming more processed foods - and moving away from staple foods towards \"more processed and prepared food products that contain a greater proportion of animal protein\". 3. There are no more fish in the sea The figures show that while catching fish in the oceans has stagnated, there will be a rise in aquaculture - farming fish will contribute around 45% of total fishery production by 2020. This makes fish production larger than any of the single meat categories. Over 80% of world aquaculture production is located in Asia, with China alone accounting for over 60%. 4. The new powers will be Eastern Europe and Asia Trade in food is going to be pretty slow - growing by less than 2% as countries struggle to feed their own populations. The big countries will continue to dominate but the OECD predicts that exports of grain from the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Kazakhstan and other countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia are anticipated to grow very rapidly. It also says that higher exports from Brazil are anticipated for virtually all its main commodities. In contrast, exports from the EU will be stagnant based on slow growth in production and a strong Euro. There's a lot more data below. What can you do with it?

        "debiased_text": "The latest data, released today by the OECD and the UN's FAO, provides estimates of changes in food prices over the next ten years. The analysis considers factors such as demand, consumption levels, transportation costs, and population growth. The findings indicate that while a favorable harvest may lead to a temporary decrease in prices next year, the overall trend is expected to be upward. Over the coming decade, real prices for cereals could average as much as 20% higher, and those for meats could average as much as 30% higher, compared to the period 2001-10. These projections are lower than the peak price levels observed during 2007-08 and this year. However, the report suggests that higher food prices are becoming increasingly common. \n\nAcross the OECD, food prices have been rising, according to the latest report. From January 2010 to 2011, three-quarters of OECD countries experienced retail food price increases of 5% or less, while in six countries, prices rose by over 5%. Korea and Estonia saw increases of over 10%. Brazil, China, Indonesia, and the Russian Federation experienced double-digit food inflation rates this past year, which is a significant increase from the previous year's single-digit inflation rates. In developing and least developed countries, a similar pattern of accelerating food price inflation was observed, although Ghana and Kenya experienced a slowing of price increases. In Rwanda, retail food prices decreased by approximately 2%.\n\nThe report notes that demand for commodities is expected to rise in developing countries due to population growth and increasing incomes, while demand in the developed west is projected to remain stable, as food consumption per person is already higher. Developing regions are also expected to have the highest growth in per capita income. As part of this trend, individuals are predicted to consume more processed foods and shift away from staple foods toward more processed and prepared food products containing a greater proportion of animal protein.\n\nThe data indicates that ocean fish catches have stagnated, but aquaculture, or fish farming, is expected to grow. By 2020, aquaculture is projected to account for around 45% of total fishery production, surpassing any single meat category. Over 80% of global aquaculture production is currently based in Asia, with China alone contributing over 60% of that total.\n\nFood trade is expected to grow at a rate of less than 2% as countries focus on meeting their domestic food needs. Larger countries are expected to remain dominant in the global food trade. The OECD forecasts rapid growth in grain exports from the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and other countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Brazil is also expected to see increased exports of its main commodities. In contrast, exports from the EU are expected to remain stagnant due to low production growth and a strong Euro. Additional data is available for further analysis."

        "title": "IMF under growing pressure to appoint non-European head",
        "original_text": "The International Monetary Fund is facing growing pressure from emerging economic powers and campaigners to appoint a non-European as Dominique Strauss-Kahn's successor, following the resignation of the imprisoned IMF managing director. China and Brazil have demanded that the succession process be handled in a fair and open way, and are calling for an end to the status quo under which a European has led the IMF since its creation in 1945. The IMF has yet to reveal how Strauss-Kahn's replacement will be chosen but in a letter to the G20 group of the world's largest economies Brazil's finance minister, Guido Mantega, said: \"If the Fund wants to maintain its legitimacy, its managing director must be selected after broad consultation with the member countries.\" A global group of anti-poverty campaigners said that the troubled state of the global economy made it imperative to select the best possible candidate from a worldwide pool. \"It is time for the European and US governments to finally end the sordid, tacit deal between the two regions that has maintained a de facto northern leadership at both the Fund and the World Bank,\" said Bhumika Muchhala of the Third World Network. Germany's Angela Merkel has made it clear that she wants the job to go to a European. European Commission president José Manuel Barroso said he also thought the role, which has become crucial since the eurozone sovereign debt crisis exploded, should go to a European. He told CNN: \"Yes, I think it should be a European ... they are the biggest stakeholders in the IMF and there are a lot of Europeans that can do that job. So why now choose someone because he's not European? That makes no sense.\" There are equally trenchant opinions among IMF insiders. One former senior official said: \"The big danger here is if the Europeans just try to put their person in. For example, Christine Lagarde [France's finance minister]. That would be a disaster. The Europeans have their heads in the sand again and if they do it, there will be bad fallout.\" \"Christine Lagarde stands for protecting big banks. I know people like what she said to Jamie Dimon [chief executive of JP Morgan Chase] at Davos but she's the most pro-bank bailout of the lot. \"The Americans are going to try and put in [White House adviser] David Lipton as number two. Lipton is Mr Bank Bailout. He worked for Citigroup. If they put in Lagarde and Lipton, what does that say? We are going with the total bank protection plan. That would be a disaster.\" Voting power Under the voting system used by the IMF, America and Europe have been able to ensure that a European candidate runs the IMF while an American citizen takes charge at the World Bank. The eurozone debt crisis, which has seen the IMF contribute to the bailouts of Greece, Portugal and Ireland, has led many emerging market countries to believe that the next head of the IMF should not come from the EU. The US holds nearly 17% of the voting power at the IMF, giving it enough muscle to block a non-favoured candidate. China, despite being the world's second largest economy, holds only 3.65% of the votes. Beijing, like Brasilia, appears keen for someone from an emerging economy to run the IMF this time. Jiang Yu, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign minister, said on Thursday that the IMF's top executives should be appointed on the basis of \"impartiality\" and \"merit\". This came after the state-run China Daily newspaper reported Guo Tianyong, a leading Chinese economist, predicting that \"Europe's history of chairing the IMF may be broken\". The decision will eventually be made after an election involving each of the 187 member countries. Any country can nominate a candidate, and a winner must secure 85% of the votes. However, this voting power is concentrated among just a few countries, with America holding an effective veto. Each country has been assigned a \"quota\" of voting shares, which is related to its GDP, the nature of its economy and the size of its international reserves. These quotas were fixed when the IMF was created in 1945, and reflect the balance of economic and political power at that time, giving America and Europe the power to swing the decision. In practice, a series of behind the scenes negotiations has ended with a European being appointed to take the rein. Two years ago the IMF agreed to make the voting system more equitable, and it has plans to dilute Europe's influence and bolster \"dynamic\" emerging nations including China and Brazil. Neither plan, though, has yet been implemented. The IMF's role When the IMF is not stepping in as the lender of last resort for desperate countries facing a cash crunch, its job is to oversee the workings of the global economy. Each member country gets an annual school report from the IMF, known as an \"Article IV\", that scores its performance on a range of policies, from keeping its public finances under control to tackling unemployment. In practice, governments can often have the harshest criticisms of their performance watered down, but a negative verdict can still be embarrassing. Since the financial crisis, the IMF is also meant to be taking on a stronger role in global \"surveillance\" – trying to foresee the next trouble spots in the global economy, and persuade countries to take action to resolve imbalances, such as gaping trade surpluses or undervalued currencies, before world financial markets descend into chaos. However, it is still unclear how exactly the IMF will carry out this new role, and whether the offending countries will take any notice of it whatsoever. The IMF also hosts two meetings a year – a spring meeting in April and an annual meeting in the autumn – which act as a forum for the world's finance ministers to get together and discuss the challenges of globalisation.",
        "debiased_text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is under increasing calls from emerging economic powers and advocacy groups to select a non-European as the successor to Dominique Strauss-Kahn, following his resignation. China and Brazil are advocating for a transparent and fair selection process, emphasizing an end to the current arrangement where European individuals have led the IMF since its establishment in 1945. The IMF has not yet disclosed how the selection of Strauss-Kahn's replacement will proceed. In a letter to the G20, Brazil's finance minister, Guido Mantega, stressed the importance of broad consultation with member countries for the managing director's appointment. A global anti-poverty advocacy group suggested it is essential to choose the best candidate from a worldwide pool, given the current state of the global economy. Bhumika Muchhala of the Third World Network stated that the European and US governments should reconsider the existing informal agreement that has led to northern leadership at both the IMF and the World Bank. Angela Merkel of Germany has expressed a preference for a European candidate to succeed Strauss-Kahn. José Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, echoed this sentiment, saying that a European should lead the IMF given their status as major stakeholders and the availability of qualified European candidates. There are differing opinions among IMF insiders, with one former senior official warning that attempting to appoint another European could lead to negative consequences. The official raised concerns about potential candidates like Christine Lagarde, France's finance minister, suggesting that her stance on protecting large banks could be detrimental. Similarly, the official noted that if David Lipton, a White House adviser and former Citigroup employee, were to be appointed to a key position, it would indicate a continued focus on bank bailouts. The IMF's voting system grants America significant influence, enabling it to ensure European appointments while the World Bank is led by an American. Europe's historical dominance is seen by some as a potential obstacle to a more representative leadership, as emerging market countries believe the next IMF head should not be from the European Union. The United States holds nearly 17% of the voting power at the IMF, allowing it to block candidates not aligned with its preferences. China, despite its status as the world's second-largest economy, holds only 3.65% of the votes. Chinese officials have expressed a desire for the selection of an individual from an emerging economy. Jiang Yu, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign minister, emphasized that the IMF's top executives should be chosen based on impartiality and merit.

However, voting power remains concentrated in a few countries, with the United States effectively holding a veto. Each member country's voting shares are determined by its quota, which is based on its GDP, economic structure, and international reserves. These quotas were established in 1945 and have not been updated since, reflecting the economic and political landscape of that time. Behind-the-scenes negotiations have historically resulted in a European serving as IMF head. Two years ago, the IMF committed to making its voting system more equitable, aiming to reduce European influence and increase the representation of dynamic emerging nations such as China and Brazil. However, these reforms have yet to be implemented. The IMF's responsibilities include acting as a lender of last resort for countries facing a financial crisis and overseeing global economic policies. Each member country receives an annual evaluation, referred to as an 'Article IV' report, which assesses its performance in various areas, including public finances and employment. While governments may have criticisms of their reports softened, a negative assessment can still be challenging. Since the financial crisis, the IMF has taken on a more prominent role in monitoring global economic trends and addressing imbalances before they lead to significant market instability. The exact methods of implementing this role remain unclear, as well as whether countries will heed the IMF's recommendations. The IMF also conducts two major meetings annually: a spring meeting in April and an annual meeting in the autumn, which serve as a platform for global finance ministers to discuss issues related to globalization."

        "original_text": "A federal district judge in New Orleans awarded $2.6 million in damages Thursday to seven Virginia families who sued a Chinese drywall manufacturer, in a case that has been closely watched by homeowners, home builders and insurers. Judge Eldon Fallon, in federal district court in New Orleans, issued the judgment in favor of homeowners who sued Taishan Gypsum Company Ltd., a Chinese state-owned drywall manufacturer, according to court documents. Taishan Gypsum did not appear in court to defend itself. It is unclear whether the judgment will be paid by Taishan or how they can be made to pay under current laws. Millions of tons of Chinese drywall, or gypsum board, were imported into the U.S. from about 2004 through 2007 when a shortage developed after record hurricane seasons at the height of the building boom. In the past few years, thousands of homeowners have filed complaints with state and federal agencies saying the drywall emits irritating fumes, corrodes metals and breaks down electrical appliances. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the agency charged with protecting Americans from unsafe household products, last week released interim remediation guidelines and said certain Chinese drywall samples emitted hydrogen sulfide, a flammable gas with a rotten-egg smell, at rates 100 times greater than non-Chinese drywall samples. The commission declined to comment on the judge's decision Thursday. A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., said he was not informed of the specifics of the case, and wouldn't comment, for now. Judge Fallon ordered Taishan Gypsum, which never answered the complaint nor appeared at any U.S. hearing, to remove and replace all the drywall, copper plumbing, air conditioning and ventilation units, insulation and electrical wiring, as well as flooring in affected homes. The judge also ordered Taishan to pay for the relocation of homeowners for four to six months while their homes are being repaired, even in homes only partly built with tainted material. Judge Fallon set aside health claims for later trials. The 100-plus page opinion \"gives tremendous guidance and...goes well beyond the seven families that were involved,\" said Richard Serpe, an attorney for the Virginia homeowners, adding that the ruling could set a precedent for other owners of houses that were built with defective drywall from China. Thursday's ruling could help set the tone for how thousands of other claims are handled by federal and state courts, legal experts say. In addition to Taishan Gypsum, other companies based in China, including, Knauf Plasterboard Tianjin, or KPT, are facing lawsuits by homeowners and home builders. A ruling in another lawsuit, Hernandez vs. Knauf, is expected shortly. That case is also being heard in New Orleans federal court by Judge Fallon as part of complex multi-district litigation against Chinese drywall makers. Builders including Lennar Corp., who have used the Chinese drywall, also have filed product-liability lawsuits against some Chinese drywall manufacturers and distributors. Lennar declined to comment. KPT said Thursday's ruling \"was a default proceeding against Taishan Gypsum Co Ltd. in which Taishan did not present any evidence\" and \"unlike Taishan, KPT presented its evidence in the Hernandez trial and is awaiting a ruling from Judge Eldon Fallon in that matter.\" The company also said it would continue to work with the commission, state regulators and others in evaluating the concerns. Until the Hernandez decision comes out, \"we will not have a firm indication of how future cases may play out,\" said Russ Herman, a court-appointed liaison attorney for the plaintiffs in the Chinese drywall multidistrict litigation, which involves thousands of claims and multiple defendants, including drywall makers, importers, distributors, builders, installers and insurers.",

        "original_text": "ROME -- Italy's Finance Ministry has held talks with China's sovereign-wealth fund and other Chinese officials in a bid to persuade Beijing to buy large amounts of Italian bonds, a person familiar with the matter said, as Rome searches for ways to meet its financing needs and pull the peninsula out of the euro-zone debt crisis. Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti met with a delegation of Chinese officials last week -- including Lou Jiwei, chairman of the China Investment Corp sovereign fund, or CIC -- to discuss possible bond purchases by the fund, the person said. The talks were also attended by China's ambassador to Italy Ding Wei, officials from Beijing's State Administration of Foreign Exchage, or SAFE, and officials from the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, an investment vehicle controlled by Rome, the person said. So far, it is unclear whether the talks will lead to any big bond purchases by Beijing, according to the person. In 2010, the arrival of Chinese delegations in Greece and other debt-ridden European economies stoked investor hopes that Beijing would ride to the rescue. The highly touted Chinese investments, however, never materialized. Earlier this summer, the director general of Italy's Treasury Vittorio Grilli led an Italian delegation to Beijing, but it was unclear if possible bond purchases were discussed during that trip, a second person familiar with the matter said. Representatives for Italy's Finance Ministry and for China's embassy in Rome didn't respond to calls seeking comment. The talks come as Italy is under intense pressure to pass more than 50 billion euros ($67.8 billion) in austerity measures in order to balance its budget by 2013. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi spent months flip-flopping on possible austerity measures, only recently settling on a plan that includes a mix of tax increases and public spending cuts. The plan faces a vote in the lower house of Parliament this week. With 1.9 trillion euros in public debt, Italy is regarded by many analysts as too big for other euro-zone countries to bail out. Investors have begun to question whether Italy will be able to pay down its long-term debts, worries that have sent Italy's borrowing costs to historic highs. That rise prompted the European Central Bank to begin buying Italian bonds a month ago, helping to prop up Italy's distressed bond market. The ECB, however, has warned Rome that the purchases are only temporary and called for a swift economic overhaul that will reignite Italy's stalled economy. CIC is large, but has already invested the vast majority of its capital. In its annual report issued in July, it said it had assets of $409.6 billion at the end of 2010, but cash holdings of just 4% of its international portfolio. CIC is seeking an additional allocation of reserves.",

        "original_text": "Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate chaired by Li Ka-shing, will raise $5.5bn from an initial public offering of units in a trust holding its South China ports after setting the price in the middle of the IPO range . The amount raised is about 6 per cent below the top of the target range of $4.9bn to $5.8bn announced when the IPO of Hutchison Ports Holdings Trust was launched in Singapore two weeks ago. However, the sale of the group's Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Pearl River assets is easily south-east Asia's largest IPO. It comfortably exceeds the $4.1bn raised by Petronas Chemicals in Kuala Lumpur last year . The final price of $1.01 per unit is just above the middle of the initial indicative range of 91 US cents to $1.08. It is at the mid-point of a tighter range of 99 cents to $1.03 communicated to investors last week. The price, announced in Singapore after the closure of the retail offer on Monday, was said by people close to the transaction to reflect demands from investors for the highest possible dividend yield. A high yield was one of the main attractions of the Singapore business trust structure chosen for the IPO by Hutchison Port Holdings, the Hutchison group subsidiary which is the world's largest container port operator by throughput. The unit price implies a yield of just below the mid-point of the indicative range of 5.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent for 2011, with the implied yield for 2010 also just below the middle of the indicative range of 6.1 per cent to 7.2 per cent. The people close to the transaction said there was a possibility that the IPO's over-allotment option might be triggered, which could raise a further $800m if exercised in full. They said no decision would be taken, however, until after the stock begins trading on the Singapore Exchange on Friday. A greenshoe offering would be a surprise against the current background of market nervousness caused by rising inflation in Asia, high oil prices and unrest in the Middle East. Hutchison Port Holdings will retain control of the port assets through a stake of 25 per cent in the listed trust, which is sufficient to prevent any challenge to its right to appoint the trust's management company. There was no comment on the IPO from the investment banks managing the offering, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and DBS Group of Singapore. Canning Fok, Hutchison Whampoa's group managing director, said last week, however, that the proceeds would be used for debt repayment and capital investment.",

The final unit price was set at $1.01, which is slightly above the midpoint of the initial indicative price range of 91 US cents to $1.08. This price also corresponds to the midpoint of a more refined range of 99 cents to $1.03 communicated to investors in the previous week. The price was announced in Singapore after the closure of the retail offering on Monday. According to sources familiar with the transaction, the pricing was influenced by investor demand for a high dividend yield, which was a significant factor in selecting the Singapore business trust structure for the IPO. The unit price implies a yield near the midpoint of the indicative range of 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent for 2011, and the implied yield for 2010 is also near the midpoint of the range of 6.1 percent to 7.2 percent. Sources indicated that the IPO's over-allotment option might be triggered, which could generate an additional $800 million if fully exercised, though no decision will be made until after trading begins on the Singapore Exchange on Friday. A greenshoe offering would be unexpected given the current market conditions, including rising inflation in Asia, high oil prices, and unrest in the Middle East. Hutchison Port Holdings, a subsidiary of the Hutchison group and the world's largest container port operator by throughput, will maintain control of the port assets through a 25 percent stake in the listed trust, which is enough to prevent any challenges to its authority in appointing the trust's management company. The investment banks managing the offering, including Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and DBS Group of Singapore, did not provide comments on the IPO. Canning Fok, the group managing director of Hutchison Whampoa, stated earlier in the week that the proceeds from the IPO would be used for debt repayment and capital investment."

        "title": "Censorship Inc.: Huawei to Scale Back in Iran --- Amid Activist Pressure, Chinese Firm to Limit Telecom Sales; Censorship Inc.: Huawei to Scale Back in Iran --- Amid Activist Pressure, Chinese Firm to Limit Telecom Sales",
        "original_text": "Chinese telecommunications- equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co. said it will scale back its business in Iran, where the company provides services to government-controlled telecom operators, following reports that Iranian police were using mobile-network technology to track down and arrest dissidents. Shenzhen-based Huawei will \"voluntarily restrict its business development there by no longer seeking new customers and limiting its business activities with existing customers,\" according to a statement Friday on the company's website. It said the company was making the move due to the \"increasingly complex situation in Iran.\" Company spokesmen declined to elaborate. The action follows a front-page Wall Street Journal article in October that documented how Huawei's business grew in Iran following a pullback by Western companies after the government's bloody crackdown on its citizens two years ago. Iranian human-rights groups outside Iran say there are dozens of documented cases in which dissidents were traced and arrested through the government's ability to track the location of their cellphones -- technology for which Huawei has provided support. Activists hailed the company's decision, noting it was the first time a major Chinese company had decided to scale back its business in Iran. Until now, Iran has viewed its partnership with Chinese companies as a solid alternative to Western contracts. \"This is a significant milestone,\" said Mark Wallace, president of United Against Nuclear Iran and a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. \"For the first time a major Chinese business is pulling back from Iran in the face of mounting international scorn for Iran's brutal regime.\" The New York-based group had been pressuring Huawei to leave Iran and had been communicating privately with the company for several weeks. In addition, executives at Huawei's highest levels have been discussing for months whether to scale back in Iran, according to people familiar with the matter. Those discussions gained in intensity in recent weeks, several people said. The rapidly growing, private company was founded in 1987 by its chief executive, Ren Zhengfei, a former officer in China's People's Liberation Army. Some Huawei executives in Shenzhen see operations in Iran as jeopardizing expansion opportunities in the U.S. and Europe, where the Chinese company has faced skepticism over its compliance procedures and dealings with countries that have pariah regimes. That was a driving factor behind the decision to dial back operations in Iran, a person familiar with the matter said. The Chinese company has held talks with consultants, lawyers and lobbyists from the U.S. on the issue. Mahmoud Tadjallimehr, a former Huawei employee in Germany who also has worked as a telecommunications consultant in Iran, cautioned that Huawei needs to be monitored. \"We have to keep watching them to see if they will really implement the measures they say,\" he said. Huawei, which has about 1,000 employees in Iran, said it plans to continue servicing its existing Iranian contracts. The size of Huawei's business in Iran remains unclear and tracking it is difficult, in part because it sometimes works through a Hong Kong-registered company with a different name -- Skycom Tech Co. Ltd. Employees of Huawei and Skycom say the companies are closely affiliated, although William Plummer, Huawei's vice president of external affairs in Washington, said Huawei doesn't \"have any investment\" in Skycom. He said Huawei \"had some cooperation with them in the past on commercial projects.\" An employee at an accounting firm listed in Skycom's Hong Kong records said Huwaei \"owned\" the company but declined to answer questions. A former Skycom employee who worked in the treasury department in Tehran said reports were sent daily to the company's headquarters in China, which \"was the exact same as Huawei's in China.\" The Journal reported in October that Huawei made a pitch this year to Iranian government officials to sell equipment for a mobile news service on Iran's second-largest mobile-phone operator, MTN Irancell. According to a person who attended the meeting, Huawei representatives emphasized that, being from China, they had expertise censoring the news. The company won the contract and the operator rolled out the service, according to this person. Huawei says its technology can't be used for censorship. Huawei's announcement could help the company boost its image in the U.S., where Huawei executives complain the company has been unfairly restricted in the market, despite having forged partnerships with major operators across Europe, the Middle East and Canada. In the last several years, it has grown to become the world's second-largest provider of telecommunications equipment, after Sweden's Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson. U.S. regulators have blocked Huawei's bids on major telecommunications infrastructure projects as well as acquisitions of American companies over security concerns. The White House and Congress recently have launched investigations into national security threats posed by foreign telecommunications firms, particularly worries that equipment from Huawei and other Chinese companies in U.S. systems potentially could be used by the Chinese government to track or intercept communications. Huawei's Mr. Plummer has called such concerns \"vague and unsubstantiated.\" Huawei has said it expects revenue to increase 10% in 2011 to reach $31 billion, slower than the 24% growth it saw in 2010, in part because of blocks on its expansion into the U.S. In recent months, international pressure against Iran has intensified because of a continued standoff between the Islamic Republic and the West over its nuclear program. The West says Iran is pursuing a military nuclear program but Iran rejects the claim, saying its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Iran didn't immediately react to Huawei's announcement. Official and semi-official news media didn't carry the news and messages to the Iranian mission to the United Nations went unanswered. --- Paul Sonne contributed to this article.",

The company forecasted a 10% revenue increase in 2011, expected to reach $31 billion, a slower growth rate than the 24% it achieved in 2010, partly attributed to restrictions on its expansion into the U.S. In recent months, international pressure on Iran has increased due to ongoing disputes with the West regarding Iran's nuclear program. Western nations allege that Iran is developing a military nuclear program, while Iran claims that its program is solely for peaceful purposes.

        "original_text": "GENERAL FINANCIAL Prices of US-listed Chinese stocks fell on Thursday after the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement chief said the Department of Justice was looking into accounting practices at Chinese companies, after a series of high-profile scandals this year. Internet stocks were hit hardest. Baidu, the search engine company, fell 9.2 per cent to $110.29 and ecommerce site Sina Corporation was down 9.7 per cent to $73.23. The recently listed video streaming site Youku fell 18.3 per cent to $16.24. In 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission launched a probe into so-called reverse mergers , which allow groups to bypass the scrutiny of an IPO, by taking over a shell company already listed on US exchanges. That investigation has focused in on accounting practices after at least 25 New York-listed Chinese companies disclosed discrepancies in their filings , or saw their auditors withdraw, in the first half of 2011. On Thursday, Robert Khuzami, SEC enforcement director, told Reuters that \"parts of the justice department are actively engaged in this area\", as well. The DoJ did not comment, but the Federal Bureau of Investigation and US prosecutors are investigating some Chinese companies that have accessed US markets, people familiar with the matter say. The SEC has referred investigations to the justice department in the past, where there has been evidence of criminal wrongdoing. It is not clear in this case if the DoJ has launched an investigation independently. Ryan Detrick, technical analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research, said he was not surprised to see investors take money out of Chinese internet stocks. \"So much money went into these stocks on a speculative basis, on hopes for Chinese growth, rather than fundamentals,\" he said. Internet and small-cap stocks have suffered during market volatility, as investors have sought the safety of blue-chip dividend paying stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average of the 30 biggest US stocks has outperformed the smaller cap and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index by almost 4 per cent this week alone. \"In this environment, if a stock has any question mark hanging over it, investors aren't willing to take the risk, with safer names available at good valuations,\" said James Cordwell, a tech company analyst at Atlantic Equities. But investors have been paying particularly attention to China-based companies since June, when Muddy Waters, a research firm founded by shortseller Carson Block, accused the Chinese timber firm Sino Forest of overstating its sales. C Ming Zhao, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group, said Chinese stocks were being unfairly targeted. \"You have fraud at US firms too, but you wouldn't sell Apple and Google, because of what happened at Enron.\" He said well-established Chinese stocks, with transparent accounts, should not be treated in the same way as newly listed companies. \"Stocks like Baidu and Sina Corporation are being unfairly tarnished. American investors should do their homework on company fundamentals, rather than trading on news flow,\" he said. Additional reporting by Kara Scannell in New York",

In the same article, investment bank China International Capital Corp. was misidentified as sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp. (WSJ April 22, 2011) New York City officials are courting a group of Chinese business leaders looking to open offices in the U.S. On Wednesday, the group was given a crash course on Midtown office real estate and taken on tours of One Bryant Park and the Empire State Building. The real-estate tour is part of a weeklong networking program run by the city's Economic Development Corp. trying to lure businesses with high-growth potential from Asia and Europe. In recent months, the Economic Development Corp. has wooed a group of London-based tech start-ups and plans to host businesses from Singapore and India in the future. Chinese firms in particular have been looking to boost their presence in New York as of late, said Gregory Kraut of brokerage firm CB Richard Ellis, which conducted the real-estate tour. \"When Chinese firms go public, they really want to be in New York,\" Mr. Kraut said. \"It's like when Japan came here 20 years ago.\" Prior to the financial downturn, big Chinese banks such as China Merchants Bank and China Construction Bank began setting up shop in New York. Now that the U.S. economy has begun to recover, more Chinese companies have restarted plans to make New York debuts, Mr. Kraut said. Officials with the Economic Development Corp. said attracting Chinese firms that are eager to invest is particularly important as the companies continue to grow abroad. Chinese businesses that recently opened up offices in New York include apparel company Li & Wang, which leased space in the Empire State Building earlier this year.

        "title": "Kim Jong-il on the escalator: dictatorships are going down | Jonathan Jones",
        "original_text": "Dictatorship rides the down escalator of history in this photograph. For me it is picture that shows why 2011 was a good year for the world. Kim Jong-il stands apart from the officials who carefully compose themselves on the steps above him. He gazes directly at the camera from behind sunglasses, the all-powerful observer of his people. The others do not look directly at the camera but seem unsure where to cast their eyes. They are entering a new supermarket, full of produce. Canned food and fluorescent lights – clearly North Korea is a land of plenty. No wonder there is such reverence for the man who brought this economic success. Kim Jong-il seems isolated by his power. A magic circle, a force field of charisma, keeps him apart. After all, according to reports that have followed his death last Saturday (at 8.30am, on his special train, according to state media), natural prodigies marked the passing of this miraculous man. Best stand back from a man of such uncanny attributes. This picture of Kim Jong-il in life is as surreal as the images of extravagant collective mourning for his death that have filled the state media of North Korea this week. Yet surrealism is in the eye of the beholder. The comedy of this photograph is fringed with blackness. It is known that many North Koreans live on the edge of malnutrition and starvation. The well-stocked supermarket that the great leader graces with his presence is cruelly deceptive – a show supermarket, a Potemkin image of plenty (or at least, by the standards of neighbouring countries, normality). That is cruelly obvious. What is really interesting about this, and other images from North Korea, is how we react to them. True, the state over which the man on the escalator presided has nuclear weapons and other potent military assets. The country cannot be ignored, any more than a man with a gun on the street can be ignored. But this picture raises a wry smile. North Korea's political system strikes outsiders as freakish and bizarre and grotesquely out of step with history. On the down escalator, and approaching the bottom. Behind our reaction – baffled and, let's be honest, amused – lies a success story. In our lifetimes democracy has won. It has established itself as the best of all political systems. And in 2011 the democratic idea made amazing, unexpected headway. The point about this photograph of the isolated totalitarian mirror universe ruled by Kim Jong-il is that it is a curiosity. Like a two-headed snake, it is worth keeping in a jar. But 50 years ago this picture would not have seemed strange at all. Such propaganda scenes were depressingly normal in a large part of the world. The Soviet Union and a huge tract of Europe were governed by autocratic parties. From Prague to Moscow, party leaders were posing in show factories and shops all the time. Go back further, to the 1930s, and large parts of western Europe were ruled by dictatorships of the right. Totalitarian leaders stood apart and were apparently revered, just as in this photograph. At the time they were winning. \"If you want a vision of the future,\" wrote George Orwell, \"imagine a boot stamping on a human face – forever.\" Comparisons between today's economic travails and the crisis of the 1930s are misplaced because totalitarianism was then the wave of the future. That is simply not the case today. 2011 has been a great year for democracy. People demanded their rights across north Africa and the Middle East. Authoritarian, corrupt rulers suddenly found themselves denounced as tyrants by people they believed safely under their boot heels. In a benign version of John Foster Dulles's cold war \"domino theory\", the virus of democracy spread from one Arab state to another. If Kim Jong-il had a heart attack, Colonel Gaddafi of Libya died in far gorier circumstances. We are definitely not living in the 1930s, when dictatorship was on the rise. Today the last dictators are an endangered species. In China, the state's attempt to silence dissident artist Ai Weiwei merely strengthened his voice. And that voice has consistently expressed what also seems fundamental to the Arab spring: democracy and human rights are universal imperatives. Just because these ideas originated in Europe and America in the 18th century does not make them somehow less relevant outside the affluent west. The right to free speech and free elections is a basic human need, everywhere, say the revolutionaries of 2011. Europe itself might be accused of democratic backsliding this year as \"technocrats\" came to power in Italy and Greece. But it is a melodramatic fantasy to see democracy in danger in the eurozone. Once again, the comparison – or rather the glaring contrast – with the 1930s should cheer us up. In 2011 democracy was on the march. This is a picture from a nightmare that most of the world will never endure again.",
        "debiased_text": "A photograph shows Kim Jong-il standing apart from officials who are positioned on the steps above him. He is gazing directly at the camera while wearing sunglasses. The officials appear unsure of where to cast their eyes. The image captures Kim Jong-il entering a new supermarket stocked with produce, canned food, and fluorescent lighting. This supermarket represents an image of abundance in North Korea. Following his death on Saturday at 8:30 am, as reported by state media, which occurred on his special train, there were notable reactions to the passing of the leader. The photograph, as well as the subsequent images of mourning in North Korean state media, presents a surreal depiction of the leader and his regime. It is acknowledged that many North Koreans live in conditions of malnutrition and food scarcity, and the supermarket in the image may be a representation of controlled propaganda rather than an accurate reflection of the nation's overall economic condition. The political system of North Korea, with its leader positioned apart and seemingly revered, appears unusual to many observers. However, such portrayals were common in other parts of the world during earlier periods in history, including the Soviet Union and parts of Europe during the 20th century. In the 1930s, many regions of western Europe were governed by authoritarian leaders who were similarly isolated and apparently admired. In contrast, 2011 saw various movements across North Africa and the Middle East where citizens expressed demands for political rights and change, resulting in the downfall of several authoritarian leaders. These movements, often referred to as the Arab Spring, reflected a broader push for democracy and human rights. In China, efforts to suppress the voice of dissident artist Ai Weiwei paradoxically strengthened his profile. Additionally, while the European Union has seen shifts in governance, such as the rise of technocratic leaders in Italy and Greece, these developments are not indicative of a widespread threat to democracy. The events in 2011 showed that democratic values and demands for rights are becoming increasingly global, regardless of their historical origins."

        "original_text": "It was not the shadow banks that brought the US economy to its knees. The deleveraging of all manner of non-bank investment conduits, vehicles and structures certainly magnified the impact of falling house prices and globalised the crisis. But the core of the problem was the same as in every other banking crisis: sloppy underwriting at mainstream lenders. For the US, read China. The latest data, showing a widening trade surplus while consumer inflation rose to 6.4 per cent, intensify concerns about overheating. But despite angst over its shadow banking system, the big risks are probably embedded in the real one. Regulators' concerns are understandable. Of all the varieties of informal credit intermediation, the biggest - equivalent to 7 per cent of gross bank loans, on Nomura's reckoning - is entrusted loans . In such loans, a bank acts as an agent on a third-party loan between a depositor and a borrower, and books a fee. As it does not assume any risks or rewards of the loan or the corresponding funds, it typically records it off-balance sheet, at principal amounts. The volume of such deals exploded as China tightened controls on formal lending. Even so, if China Construction Bank, the bank with the biggest disclosed exposure at year-end, brought its entrusted loans on to its balance sheet, they would total Rmb778bn ($120bn): significantly less than its fast-growing self-occupied housing loan book, which totals slightly more than Rmb1,000bn. At ICBC, Rmb395bn of entrusted loans was dwarfed by Rmb970bn of loans to manufacturers, the sector that is showing the highest impairment ratio.",

Recent data indicate a growing trade surplus alongside consumer inflation reaching 6.4 per cent, which has raised concerns about economic overheating. Although there is some worry about China's shadow banking system, the greater risks may lie within the formal banking system. Regulators' concerns are justified, as among the various forms of informal credit intermediation, entrusted loans represent the largest category, accounting for approximately 7 per cent of gross bank loans, according to Nomura. In entrusted loans, a bank acts as an intermediary between a depositor and a borrower, charging a fee while not assuming any risks or rewards associated with the loan or its funds. These loans are typically recorded off-balance sheet at principal amounts. The volume of these deals increased significantly as China imposed stricter controls on formal lending. Nonetheless, even if China Construction Bank, which has the largest disclosed exposure to entrusted loans at year-end, were to include them on its balance sheet, the total would amount to Rmb778bn ($120bn), which is much lower than its self-occupied housing loan portfolio, exceeding Rmb1,000bn.

        "title": "For Global Steel Industry, China Poses Guessing Game; For Global Steel Industry, China Poses Guessing Game",
        "original_text": "China is the world's largest market for steel. Yet the country's flawed statistics system presents a problem for steelmakers: No one knows exactly how much steel China produces or consumes. The country attracts close scrutiny from the global steel industry. Producers in Europe, North America and Asia boost or cut output, in part, based on Chinese demand. Prices and inventory levels, as well as the purchase of raw materials such as coal and iron ore, reflect the health of the Chinese market. But without firm data from China, calculating global steel supply and demand -- and hedging accordingly -- becomes a guessing game. Indeed, some Chinese steelmakers readily say they don't see why they should take the time to report their steel output. \"Report our production? No, we don't need to do that. No one asked us to report our production figure,\" said a man with the surname Meng, who identified himself as the manager of a steel plant in Huanxizhuang, a village in the northern province of Hebei. When asked, he said the plant makes 300,000 metric tons of steel a year but doesn't report the output to the government. Likewise, the manager of a plant in Xinjuntun township, with the surname Wen, said he sees no need to publish details of what he said was his site's 400,000-ton annual output: \"We are a privately run enterprise, who do I need to report to?\" On Friday, the World Steel Association, the industry's statistics repository, estimated that China's booming industry produced 7.1% more steel in April compared with the same month a year earlier. China produced a record 625 million metric tons last year, and 2011 is also on track to be a year of record output for the country. The World Steel Association bases its production estimate on figures supplied by China's national bureau of statistics and the China Iron and Steel Association. The national association, which says it represents about 75% of the country's steel producers, including Wuhan Iron and Steel Co. and BaoSteel Group Corp., the country's biggest maker, relies on its members to voluntarily submit accurate production figures. The figures indicate that China has been focusing on producing steel and making sure buyers were available for it, rather than also tracking steel inventories. The data don't include hundreds of smaller independently managed steel mills that don't often report production or don't report it fully for political and logistical reasons. \"There is an area where we do not actually have clear sources,\" said Soo Jung Kim, spokesman for the World Steel Association, based in Brussels. Still, he said the association is confident in its numbers. Peter Fish, of MEPS Ltd., a steel consultancy based in the U.K., said he believes underreporting is, in part, the result of political pressure on the industry \"to meet longstanding targets\" to close inefficient steel mills by the end of last year. \"On paper this has been successfully achieved, but in reality many of these mills continued producing and avoided closure by not submitting\" output data, he said. Mr. Fish said he believes the figures put out by China's bureau of statistics and the China Iron and Steel Association undercount actual production by 45 million tons, or about 7% to 10% of reported production in 2010. Smaller steel companies can escape notice because they sometimes generate their own electricity and the country's grid system is undeveloped. \"Nobody really knows how many steel companies are in China,\" said steel analyst Charles Bradford of Bradford Research Inc. Mr. Bradford said that not knowing how much steel is being made can lead to volatility in the global market. There could be far more warehoused steel in China than other producers realize. If the Chinese economy softens, much of that steel could be exported, which could cause prices to fall. China's steel prices have started to rise in the past month as the winter slowdown fades, but prices generally are still below -- by 10% to 15% -- prices in North America and some parts of Europe. The rest of the steel industry is watching whether prices in China will drop again this summer, an indication that there is more supply than demand in the country. Peter Marcus, steel analyst for World Steel Dynamics, said China's tax policy has also encouraged higher steel-inventory levels. China imposes high taxes on raw steel exports, as a way to encourage keeping the steel in the country and using it to make products such as automobiles, appliances and engineered products. Those finished goods can then be exported. Smaller steelmakers, who have tended not to report output, may be forced to warehouse steel they could have exported if taxes weren't so high. --- Bai Lin contributed to this article.

        "debiased_text": "China is the largest market for steel globally. The country's statistics system is considered to have limitations, which makes it difficult to determine exact figures for steel production and consumption. The global steel industry pays close attention to China's market dynamics. Producers in Europe, North America, and Asia adjust their output based on Chinese demand. Steel prices, inventory levels, and the purchase of raw materials such as coal and iron ore are influenced by the status of the Chinese market. However, the absence of firm data from China complicates the calculation of global steel supply and demand, as well as related hedging strategies. Some Chinese steelmakers do not report their production figures. A manager from Huanxizhuang village in the northern province of Hebei stated that the plant produces 300,000 metric tons of steel annually but does not report the output to the government. Another manager from Xinjuntun township mentioned that his plant produces 400,000 metric tons per year and indicated that there is no requirement to report this information publicly. On Friday, the World Steel Association estimated that China's steel production in April increased by 7.1% compared to the same month in the previous year. China produced a record 625 million metric tons of steel last year, and 2011 is also expected to see record steel production. The World Steel Association's estimates are based on data provided by China's National Bureau of Statistics and the China Iron and Steel Association. The National Bureau of Statistics represents approximately 75% of the country's steel producers, including major companies such as Wuhan Iron and Steel Co. and BaoSteel Group Corp. These associations rely on voluntary submissions from members for accurate production data. The data do not include hundreds of smaller steel mills that are independently managed and may not fully report their production due to logistical or political reasons. Soo Jung Kim, a spokesperson for the World Steel Association in Brussels, noted that there are areas where the association does not have clear information sources, but the organization remains confident in its numbers. Peter Fish of MEPS Ltd., a U.K.-based steel consultancy, suggested that underreporting may be partially attributed to political pressure on the industry to meet long-standing targets of closing inefficient steel mills by the end of the previous year. He stated that although these targets were reportedly achieved on paper, in reality, many mills continued production and avoided closure by not submitting output data. Mr. Fish indicated that China's reported production figures for 2010 may have underestimated the actual production by 45 million tons, equivalent to 7% to 10% of the reported output for that year. Smaller steel companies are sometimes able to avoid being noticed because they may generate their own electricity, and the country's grid system is not fully developed. Charles Bradford, a steel analyst from Bradford Research Inc., noted that it is unclear how many steel companies exist in China. He added that not having accurate information about steel production levels can contribute to global market volatility. It is possible that there is a greater amount of stored steel in China than other producers are aware of, and if the Chinese economy slows, this stored steel could be exported, potentially leading to a drop in prices. In the past month, China's steel prices have started to rise as the winter slowdown subsides, but they remain generally 10% to 15% below prices in North America and certain areas of Europe. The steel industry is monitoring whether Chinese steel prices will decline again this summer, which could suggest an oversupply in the country. Peter Marcus, a steel analyst for World Steel Dynamics, mentioned that China's tax policy encourages the accumulation of higher steel inventory. High taxes on raw steel exports are intended to promote domestic use of steel for producing goods such as automobiles, appliances, and engineered products, which can then be exported. Smaller steelmakers that do not report their output may be storing steel due to these tax policies, which could have prevented them from exporting it."

No, I had already been contemplating a trip to Australia.\nCommunism? No, I had vacationed safely in Cuba several times.\nFood? I'm adventuresome, having eaten mayiritsa, a traditional Greek soup of sheep innards.\nLanguage? The international students from China in my senior English classes at Riverdale High School in Pierrefonds had succeeded in attuning my ear to the lovely singsong lilt of Mandarin.\nHaving thus determined that travelling to China would be a positive experience, off we went - my three travel buddies and I - to the Lakeshore General Hospital for tetanus, typhoid and hepatitis vaccines, a prelude to what would become the teaching (and learning!) experience of a lifetime.\nRiverdale High has a \"sister school\" in the city of Zhuji in Hangzhou province. Tianma School has sent administrators and teachers over here, and we have done the same over there. This month, for the first time, our school board has also sent over a group of students. I have no doubt their experiences will reflect my own memorable two-week experience last March, a trip that has changed my view of the other side of the world.\nI knew before leaving that Beijing would be different from Montreal. Who knew, though, that without a guide/translator, my three travel buddies and I would have to latch onto an elderly Chinese couple to cross a busy intersection and live to tell about it?\nI knew that Canada is a respected country the world over, but who knew that the friendly offerings of tiny Canadian-flag pins would open so many doors, and trigger so many smiles and grins?\nAnd finally, I knew that Chinese students were hard-working, respectful and friendly. Those who come to the West Island under the auspices of the Lester B. Pearson School Board's international program learn English and gain new perspectives. These are students who know the value of a good education and leave their families for long periods of time to develop skills that open up to them a world that they would otherwise miss.\nWhat I did not understand before arriving in China and actually teaching students there is that this work ethic is pervasive throughout the country.\nWe saw it in the men and women working in the pearl farms, toiling for long hours in the heat mining huge oysters for the lustrous pearls that we North Americans covet.\nWe saw it in the energetic and focused teachers we worked with. These dedicated teachers often work 12 to 14 hours a day and many live on campus, away from their families.\nMost of all, we saw it in the dogged determination of the young students learning English.\nAs visiting Canadian teachers, we were asked to be judges in a public-speaking competition.

        "title": "Ai Weiwei's family denounce 'absurd' economic crimes investigation",
        "original_text": "Relatives of the detained Chinese artist Ai Weiwei have denounced an official report that he is suspected of economic crimes as \"absurd\". The state news agency, Xinhua, published a one-line story saying police were investigating the 53-year-old, but deleted it from its website within the hour. The piece did not explicitly say that authorities were holding him and police have not responded to faxed queries. There is still no word on Ai's friend Wen Tao, 38, who was reportedly detained on Sunday. Human rights groups believe Ai's detention is part of a wider crackdown in which scores of activists and dissidents have been detained, formally arrested or disappeared. It has sparked an international outcry. Ai's older sister, Gao Ge, told Reuters: \"The economic crimes report is absurd, because the way he was taken and then disappeared shows it's nothing of the sort. This is more like a crime gang's behaviour than a country with laws.\" She said her brother had previously warned his family he might one day be jailed for his activities. \"He was very clear that we shouldn't try to meddle and stop him speaking out ... My mother cried,\" she added. Ai's mother, Gao Ying, said the \"economic crimes\" allegations were being used to stifle his activism, adding: \"If he's not released, this will be the start of a long struggle ... They still haven't notified us why he was taken or where he is.\" Chinese law states that police must inform an individual's relatives or place of work within 24 hours of detention, unless there is no way to do so or it would \"impede the investigation\". Gao said her son was unlikely to accept charges to win a swift release. \"If he's not given justice, he'll refuse to come out, I think. That's his character,\" she said. Human rights groups allege that similar accusations of economic wrongdoing – such as tax-related charges – have been used to intimidate activists in the past. In an interview last year, Ai told the Guardian the state might take action against him and that security officials had recently visited his bank. But he added: \"I also have to speak out for people around me who are afraid, who think it is not worth it or who have totally given up hope. So I want to set an example: you can do it and this is OK.\" The Global Times, a popular state-run tabloid, has run another attack on western condemnation of the case. \"[China] needs people like Ai Weiwei. But at the same time, it is even more important that Chinese law restrict the provocative behaviour of Ai Weiwei and others,\" it wrote. The outgoing US ambassador, Jon Huntsman, described Ai Weiwei as one of the activists who \"challenge the Chinese government to serve the public in all cases and at all times\" in a strongly worded speech in Shanghai on Wednesday night. He said future ambassadors would continue to defend social activists such as Ai, jailed writer and Nobel peace prizewinner Liu Xiaobo, and Chen Guangcheng, a rights activist under house arrest.",
        "debiased_text": "Relatives of the detained Chinese artist Ai Weiwei have expressed disagreement with an official report suggesting he is suspected of economic crimes. The report, initially published by the state news agency Xinhua, stated that police were investigating the 53-year-old artist. The report was removed from the Xinhua website within an hour of its publication. The story did not explicitly confirm Ai's detention, and police have not responded to inquiries. There is currently no information available regarding Ai's friend, Wen Tao, who was reportedly detained on Sunday. Human rights groups have suggested that Ai's detention may be part of a broader pattern involving the detention, formal arrest, or disappearance of multiple activists and dissidents. This situation has led to international reactions. Ai's older sister, Gao Ge, spoke to Reuters, stating that the economic crimes accusation seemed unreasonable, given the sudden and secretive manner of Ai's detention. She mentioned that her brother had previously informed his family that his activism might result in his imprisonment. Gao Ge also said that Ai's mother was distressed by the situation. Ai's mother, Gao Ying, stated that the economic crimes allegations could be a means to suppress his activism, adding that they had not yet been informed of the reasons for his detention or his current location. According to Chinese law, police are required to notify an individual's relatives or employer within 24 hours of detention, unless doing so would hinder the investigation or is not possible. Gao Ge indicated that her son would likely not accept charges if they were intended to secure a quick release. Human rights organizations have previously claimed that similar allegations, including tax-related charges, have been used to intimidate activists. In a previous interview with the Guardian, Ai mentioned that authorities might take action against him and that security officials had visited his bank. He also stated that he intended to support others who were afraid or had lost hope by setting an example. The Global Times, a state-run newspaper, recently published an article criticizing Western responses to the situation, stating that China needs individuals like Ai Weiwei, but also emphasized the importance of Chinese law in curbing their provocative actions. Jon Huntsman, the outgoing US ambassador, referred to Ai Weiwei in a speech in Shanghai as one of the activists who 'challenge the Chinese government to serve the public in all cases and at all times.' He stated that future ambassadors would support activists such as Ai, as well as jailed writer and Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, and Chen Guangcheng, who is under house arrest."

        "title": "China tried to pay off Tiananmen Square family, activists claim",
        "original_text": "Chinese authorities have proposed an unofficial payoff to a family bereaved by the military crackdown that followed the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, according to a group representing the victims. In a statement released just before the 22nd anniversary of the deadly crackdown on 4 June, the Tiananmen Mothers said security forces had privately approached one of their members to discuss an individual payoff. But the member rejected the proposal – discussed during two visits in February and April – because it was secretive and made no mention of an investigation, apology or public accounting for what happened. \"This year, the silence was finally broken. This should have been welcome. But what in fact does this belated response mean?\" asked the 127 members of the group who signed the statement. \"The visitors did not speak of making the truth public, carrying out judicial investigations, or providing an explanation for the case of each victim. Instead, they only raised the question of how much to pay, emphasising that this was meant for that individual case and not for the families in the group as a whole.\" The group said they had documented the cases of 203 people who were shot, beaten or crushed to death by People's Liberation Army tanks in the wake of the 1989 protests. Many other victims remained unidentified, they said. The government tightly restricts discussion of the demonstrations – which spread to several cities – or the murderous crackdown that followed, except occasionally to justify the actions as necessary to prevent political turmoil. Given the government's stance, direct public compensation for victims' families is highly unlikely, but several senior cadres have called for a re-evaluation of the protests and a recognition that the students and workers were not involved in a counter-revolutionary plot. There have been reports of unofficial payoffs. In 2005, Tang Deying – the mother of a student killed in police custody in Chengdu soon after the 1989 protests – was given 70,000 yuan (£6,850) in \"hardship assistance\" by local officials, according to a local activist, Huang Qi. Overseas lawyers and human rights activists said the government's latest approach to the Tiananmen Mothers was unlikely to signal a change of policy. \"We know the communist party has tried to get people to remain silent on this issue by using carrots as well as sticks,\" said Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch. \"I doubt that this will lead to acknowledgement of government responsibility, though the fact that the Tiananmen Mothers are not in jail is an unspoken recognition of the legitimacy of their case.\" Others expressed surprised that the approach came while China is in the midst of the tightest clampdown on dissent since 1989. \"Why now?\" asked Joshua Rosenzweig of the Dui Hua foundation, which supports political prisoners. \"It seems an unlikely moment for the state – even in this limited way – to address this legacy.\"",
        "debiased_text": "Chinese authorities have reportedly made an informal proposal to a family affected by the military actions that occurred following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, according to a group that represents the victims. This statement was released close to the 22nd anniversary of the events, which took place on 4 June. The Tiananmen Mothers, as the group is known, mentioned that security forces had approached one of their members during two visits in February and April to discuss a potential financial settlement. The member declined the offer, as it was presented in a private manner and did not involve an investigation, apology, or public explanation of the events. The 127 members of the group who signed the statement questioned the significance of the belated response. They noted that the officials did not address matters related to transparency, justice, or explanations for individual cases, but instead focused solely on the financial amount and emphasized that the payment was intended for an individual case rather than for the families as a collective. The group has documented the cases of 203 individuals who were reportedly shot, beaten, or crushed by People's Liberation Army tanks in the aftermath of the 1989 protests. They also stated that many other victims remain unidentified. Discussion of the protests and the subsequent crackdown is heavily restricted by the government, which has occasionally justified the actions as necessary to maintain political stability. While direct public compensation for the families of victims is considered improbable due to the government's stance, some senior officials have suggested a re-evaluation of the protests and acknowledged that the participants, including students and workers, were not necessarily part of a counter-revolutionary conspiracy. There have been previous reports of unofficial financial settlements. In 2005, Tang Deying, the mother of a student who died in police custody in Chengdu shortly after the 1989 protests, reportedly received 70,000 yuan in what was described as 'hardship assistance' by local authorities, according to a local activist named Huang Qi. Overseas legal professionals and human rights advocates indicated that the current approach by the government to the Tiananmen Mothers likely does not represent a fundamental shift in policy. Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch stated that the communist party has historically used both incentives and pressures to encourage silence regarding the issue. He expressed doubt that this would result in an admission of government responsibility, although the fact that the Tiananmen Mothers are not imprisoned may be seen as an implicit acknowledgment of the legitimacy of their cause. Some observers have noted the unexpected timing of the government's outreach, given the recent stringent measures against dissent in China. Joshua Rosenzweig of the Dui Hua foundation, an organization that supports individuals who are detained for political reasons, questioned the timing, stating that it appeared inconsistent with the government's current stance on addressing such historical issues."

        "title": "The big questions China still has to answer; The big questions China still has to answer",
        "original_text": "The world's economic leaders need to \"rebalance\" their thinking as well as their economies. Fiscal and monetary policies have dominated. That makes sense to a degree: decisions on deficits, debt and the eurozone this autumn may well determine whether the global economy slides deeper into danger or begins the long climb back. But these policies are insufficient for sustained growth: we need action on the structural dynamics to generate jobs, higher productivity and a sustainable long-term rebalancing. What happens in China is as important as Europe, Japan or the US. China's growth has been a source of strength in the crisis but its leaders know their growth model is unsustainable. For 30 years, China has enjoyed average annual growth of about 10 per cent. In 1990, its income per capita was 30 per cent lower than the average for sub-Saharan Africa - today, it is three times greater, more than $4,000. By 2030, if China reaches a per capita income of $16,000 - a reasonable possibility - the effect on the world economy would be equivalent to adding 15 of today's South Koreas. It is hard to see how that expansion could be accommodated within an export and investment-led growth model, so China will need to rebalance through boosting domestic demand, lowering savings and increasing consumption. Without fundamental structural changes, China is in danger of becoming caught in a \"middle income trap\" - exacerbating the world's growth problems. In the short term, there is the risk of inflation driven by food prices. In the longer term, the drivers of China's meteoric rise are waning: resources have largely shifted from agriculture to industry; as the labour force shrinks and the population ages, there are fewer workers to support retirees; productivity increases are declining, partly because the economy is exhausting gains from the transfer of basic production methods. Then there are other challenges: rising inequality; heavy use of energy and production of carbon; environmental degradation; an underdeveloped service sector and an overreliance on foreign markets. China's policymakers are well aware of \"what\" they need to do. Their 12th five-year plan points the way. Their challenge now is \"how\" to do it. Together, China's Development Research Center of the State Council and the World Bank are working to turn \"what\" into \"how\" for a report later this year. Our starting point is a vision of China in 2030 as one of the high income countries, while also protecting its environment and natural resources, encouraging creativity and sharing duties in the global economy. This weekend in Beijing, Chinese and international experts will be discussing possible reforms and how to implement them, step by step. A critical question is how China can complete its transition to a market economy. A broad agenda needs to include redefining the role of the government and the rule of law, expanding the private sector, promoting competition, and deepening land, labour and financial market reforms. To unleash its human potential, China will need to accelerate the pace of open innovation, so that competition encourages Chinese firms to invent products and processes - not only through China's research and development, but also by participating in global networks. China can \"grow green\" through a mix of market incentives, regulations, public and private investments, standards and institutional development. China also aims to deliver equality of opportunity and social security to all its citizens. To do so, it needs to consider how best to deliver more and better quality public services, ensure effective and efficient social safety nets, and mobilise the private and public sectors to share responsibilities in financing, delivering and monitoring social services. China will weigh how to strengthen its fiscal system - bringing all public resources \"on budget\" and connecting resources to different levels of government expenditures. Yet without mobilising additional resources, including from state-owned enterprises, it will be difficult to advance reforms. We will also discuss how China can embrace its global role as a responsible economic stakeholder. China is already an important stakeholder in the international system, yet a cautious one. In the future its leaders can be a key partner for global solutions. Even while coping with today's economic turmoil, world leaders need to design the engines of growth for tomorrow. That agenda will also build market confidence that can provide a boost today. China's quest to find a sustainable growth model will contribute to other developing countries, regional and global growth, and the stability of the international economy. China is preparing to address its challenges. Developed countries would be wise to look ahead at their structural growth challenges too. The writer is president of the World Bank Group",
        "debiased_text": "The global economic leaders are considering the need to reassess both their economic policies and their approach to structural dynamics. Fiscal and monetary policies have been the primary focus, as decisions related to deficits, debt, and eurozone matters this autumn may significantly influence the global economy's future trajectory. However, these policies are considered inadequate for maintaining long-term growth, and there is a need for structural reforms to facilitate job creation, productivity improvements, and a sustainable rebalancing of economies. China's economic developments are viewed as equally significant as those of Europe, Japan, and the United States. China's economic growth has been a contributing factor during the current crisis, and its leadership is aware that the existing growth model might be unsustainable. China has historically experienced an average annual growth rate of approximately 10 percent. In 1990, its per capita income was 30 percent lower than the average for sub-Saharan Africa; currently, it is more than three times greater, over $4,000. If China achieves a per capita income of $16,000 by 2030, which is a plausible scenario, the impact on the global economy would be similar to adding 15 South Koreas of today's size. It is difficult to accommodate this kind of expansion within a growth model that is export and investment driven. As such, China is expected to focus on increasing domestic demand, reducing savings, and boosting consumption. Without substantial structural reforms, China faces the risk of encountering a middle-income trap, which may amplify global growth issues. In the short term, there is a potential risk of inflation resulting from rising food prices. In the long term, the factors that have driven China's rise are diminishing, including the depletion of gains from basic production methods, shifting resources from agriculture to industry, a shrinking labor force, and an aging population, which create challenges in maintaining worker support for retirees. Additional concerns include rising inequality, high energy consumption, significant carbon emissions, environmental degradation, and an underdeveloped service sector, alongside overreliance on foreign markets. China's policymakers have identified the key areas for reform as outlined in their 12th five-year plan. The challenge now is to determine how to implement these changes effectively. In collaboration with the World Bank, China's Development Research Center of the State Council is working on a report to be released later this year. The vision for China by 2030 includes achieving high-income status while protecting the environment and natural resources, encouraging innovation and creativity, and promoting shared responsibilities within the global economy. This weekend in Beijing, Chinese and international experts will engage in discussions to explore possible reforms and their implementation. A significant topic of discussion will be the transition of China toward a market economy. The agenda should include redefining the role of government, strengthening the rule of law, expanding the private sector, promoting competition, and advancing reforms in land, labor, and financial markets. To unlock its human potential, China must increase the pace of open innovation, encouraging firms to develop products and processes regardless of whether the innovation occurs through domestic research and development or via participation in global networks. China can adopt a green growth strategy using a combination of market incentives, regulations, and public and private investments, along with the development of standards and institutions. Additionally, China aims to provide equality of opportunity and social security to its citizens. To achieve this, the government will need to evaluate the most effective methods for delivering public services of higher quality, establishing efficient social safety nets, and uniting the private and public sectors in funding, delivering, and monitoring these services. There is also a need to review how China can strengthen its fiscal system by including all public resources in the budget and aligning them with government expenditures on different levels. Without mobilizing supplementary resources, including those from state-owned enterprises, advancing these reforms may prove difficult. Discussions will also focus on China's role in the global economy, acknowledging its current participation as a significant yet cautious stakeholder. In the future, China might become a key partner in providing global economic solutions. While China is addressing its current economic challenges, global leaders are also being encouraged to consider structural growth strategies that will support future economic development. This approach may also help boost market confidence in the present. China's efforts toward a sustainable growth model are anticipated to benefit other developing countries, support regional and global growth, and enhance the stability of the international economy. China is actively preparing to manage these challenges, and developed nations are advised to examine their own structural growth issues as well."

        "original_text": "From Mr Stanley Lubman. Sir, In arguing that China must move faster to promote democracy (\"Sooner or later China will embrace democracy\", June 7) Victor Mallet ignores the complexities involved in changing China's governance. Unwilling leaders combine with social instability to create conditions more likely to result in political disorder than orderly transition. China's leaders obviously lack the will to bring about a meaningful rule of law, not to mention representative government. They are at best ambivalent about the relationship between civil society and the state, and are often hostile to institutions they perceive as detrimental to continued Chinese Communist party dominance, such as religion and the internet. China also presently lacks the economic and social stability needed for political reform. Economic reform of state-owned enterprises, a bankrupt financial system, a casino-like stock market and the lack of a national social safety net are only the most obvious difficulties. Offering moralistic advice to other nations on democratisation is a venerable tradition in US foreign policy. Such advice to China might be more credible, however, if it were buttressed by substantial assistance to legal reform and budding non-governmental organisations. Congress, however, has been niggardly. More basically, in the face of China's size and its social and economic flux, progress towards political reform can only be slow and impossible to accelerate. Stanley Lubman, Lecturer in Chinese law, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, US",
        "debiased_text": "Stanley Lubman, a lecturer in Chinese law at the University of California, Berkeley, responded to Victor Mallet's article advocating for faster democratic reforms in China. Lubman stated that transitioning China's governance is complex due to social instability and leadership challenges. He noted that China's leaders have shown limited commitment to establishing rule of law or representative government, often viewing certain institutions as threats to the Chinese Communist Party's authority. Lubman also highlighted economic and social challenges, including state-owned enterprise reforms, financial system issues, stock market volatility, and the absence of a comprehensive social safety net. He suggested that U.S. advice on democratization could be more credible if supported by assistance for legal reforms and NGOs, but noted Congress has provided limited funding. Lubman concluded that political reform in China would likely progress slowly given the country's size and socioeconomic conditions."

        "original_text": "Thirty years ago, when the United States left Vietnam, the defining moment was the image of helicopters lifting off the roof of American buildings in Saigon. Last week, the Communist prime minister of Vietnam was received at the White House, where he asked for George W. Bush's help in his country's bid to join the World Trade Organization.\nWhy not? America has already become Vietnam's largest trading partner, with two-way trade of $6 billion U.S. in 2004.\nThen, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai flew to Boston, where, as the Boston Globe reported, he visited Harvard Yard and rubbed the foot of John Harvard's statue for good luck. At lunch with Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and Senator Ted Kennedy, the Vietnamese prime minister said Ho Chi Minh studied in Boston from 1911 to 1913 and was inspired by the American Revolution.\n\"This is the city,\" he said, \"where President Ho Chi Minh absorbed the great ideals enshrined in the 1776 Declaration of Independence of the United States of America, to which he later referred in the immortal declaration of independence giving birth to the new state of Vietnam in 1945.\" As he spoke, protesters outside included the U.S.-born children of Vietnamese boat people.\nThirty years ago, the turmoil of China's decade-long Cultural Revolution was moving to a close with the death of Mao Tse-Tung in 1976 and the emergence of Deng Xiao Ping as the leader of China's real Great Leap Forward - to a capitalist market in a communist state.\nNow there's another kind of red storm rising on the American horizon - China Inc.\nThe Chinese are on a buying spree of U.S. companies, reminiscent of Japan Inc. in the 1980s. And not just any U.S. companies, but American icons.\nEarlier this year, China's Lenovo Group purchased IBM's personal computer division for\n$1.75 billion U.S.\nThen this month, China's Haier Group made a friendly\n$1.3-billion U.S. bid on the Maytag Corp., third-largest manufacturer of appliances in the United States and fourth-largest in the world.\nIt's not clear whether the Maytag Man would be out of work, or whether the Chinese would finally find something for him to do.\nImagine if the Chinese owned the Maytag brand, which includes Hoover, and could build washing machines and vacuum cleaners in China. They would own a great American brand name, competing in global markets, at Chinese labour costs. This is called comparative advantage.\nNot content to be successful sellers, the Chinese have decided to become owners of strategic U.S. industries. In 2004, China racked up a huge $160-billion U.S. trade surplus with the United States. The Chinese have also financed the U.S. trade deficit by buying $230 billion in U.S. treasuries in the last five years.\nThen, last week, came the biggest and boldest Chinese play yet - a $18.5-billion U.S. all-cash bid for Unocal, a U.S. oil company, $2.1 billion more than a cash-and-stock offer by Chevron.\nWith the Chinese economy growing at an amazing 10 per cent a year over the last decade, China has become the world's second-largest importer of oil after the United States. Canada remains the largest exporter of oil and gas to the U.S., accounting for 17 per cent of oil imports (nearly 2 million barrels a day) and 16 per cent of natural gas consumption.\nThe China National Offshore Oil Company is on a mission - to secure the supply of oil by owning it. Similarly, CNOOC has ventured into the Calgary oil patch, buying pieces of Alberta companies. China Minmetals has also bid $6.7 billion on Noranda Inc, one of Canada's leading mining companies.\nOil might be just a commodity, but at $60 a barrel U.S. it is a precious commodity, one that runs the global economy. But oil being oil, this deal is also about politics. The New York Times reports nearly 75 per cent of Unocal's proved reserves are in Asia, and CNOOC has already promised any oil drilled in the U.S. will remain there (even though the company has no retail presence).\nNo matter. The Bush administration is coming under pressure to reject the deal on national security grounds. But that, apart from a bunch of Texas oil guys interfering in the free market, would also raise all kinds of linkages on Sino-American relations. For example, the U.S. is counting on China's help to keep North Korea's nuclear ambitions in check. The U.S. is also pressuring China to re- evaluate its currency, the yuan, whose undervaluation contributes to the yawning trade deficit. Blocking a successful Unocal bid would be bad for diplomatic trade.\nWhere will it all end? As with Japan, you'll know the Chinese are overpaying - and the acquisition spree is coming to an end - when they start buying Hollywood movie studios.\nian-macdonald@sympatico.ca",
        "debiased_text": "Thirty years after the United States withdrew from Vietnam, marked by the departure of helicopters from Saigon, the Prime Minister of Vietnam recently visited the White House.

Additionally, China National Offshore Oil Company made an $18.5 billion bid for Unocal, a U.S. oil company, exceeding a competing offer from Chevron.\n\nChina's economic growth has averaged 10% annually over the past decade, making it the world's second-largest oil importer. The country has also been active in Canada's energy sector, with investments in Alberta's oil industry and a $6.7 billion bid for Noranda Inc., a Canadian mining company.\n\nThe Unocal bid has raised discussions about potential political and economic implications, including concerns over national security and U.S.-China relations. The U.S. currently relies on China for cooperation on issues such as North Korea's nuclear program and currency valuation adjustments."

Geoff Dyer reports: [ASIA EDITION]; China tries to ease pain of equity sell-off: Stock market regulators are trying to learn from mistakes of the past when investors took fright. Geoff Dyer reports:   [ASIA EDITION ]",
        "original_text": "Chinese stock marketregu-lators tried yesterday to ease the impact on investors of a new plan to sell part of the state's huge equityholdings, while the market continued to take a cautious approach to the scheme. One of the fourcompanies taking part in the pilot programme to sell state shares announced substantialcompensation to existinginvestors for the likely dilution of their stakes. Meanwhile, a state newspaper said the regulator might freeze new initial public offerings for some months to prevent flooding the market with new shares. The measures reflect the regulator's previous experience of trying to unwind the state's equity holdings, which account for about two-thirds of the equity of listed Chinese companies and which have long been an obstacle to development of the domestic market. Four years ago, reformist officials at the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) unveiled a plan that appeared to solve two pressing problems. They intended to sell non-tradeable shares in listed companies, thereby reducing government influence and improving corporate governance, while at the same time using the money raised to help fund the creaking pension system. But they abandoned the proposal when the stock market fell by about a third because investors took fright at the prospect of a wave of new shares. A similar fall in the market this month could scupper the new reform. This time the regulator's response has been to outline a much less dramatic plan. Beginning with a pilot programme involving a limited number of companies, the state shares are to be sold only in small chunks and after shareholders have given their approval. The first four companies chosen are mid-size groups. Yesterday brought new signals that the regulators would try to implement a gradual, managed process of releasing new shares on to the market. The China Securities Journal reported that the regulators were likely to suspend domestic IPOs for the next two months. The CSRC would not comment on the report, but it is likely to ease concerns about the supply of new equity over the next few months. Meanwhile, in an effort to ease concerns about dilution, Sany Heavy Industries, one of the four companies that has announced it will sell state shares, said its existing holders of tradeable shares would receive three shares and Rmb8 (about Dollars 1) in cash for every 10 shares. It is not yet clear whether other companies will do the same. The measures appear to have had some impact on market sentiment. The initial reaction from investors had been to push the Shanghai composite index down 2.4 per cent to its lowest level in six years on Monday - the first day of trading since the plan was announced. However, although the market fell again in early trading yesterday, it closed 0.5 per cent higher. \"It will be a case of short-term pain, long-term gain,\" said Stephen Green, an economist at Standard Chartered in Shanghai. \"If you are going to try and address this issue, then they are going about it the right way.\" It was highly unlikely there would be a sustained drop in the market as a result of the share-sale programme, he said. Zhao Danyang, a fund manager at Guotai Junan Asset Management in Shenzhen, said the trial reform was a long-term positive for the stock market. \"But the corporate governance structure can't be improved overnight. It takes time.\" However, the plan still has many critics. Compensation for existing shareholders is a controversial issue and will reduce the funds available to the pension system. Moreover, the government has yet to signal whether it will relinquish control of most listed companies. Zhang Weixing, chief analyst at China Huadian Investment Consulting in Beijing, said the plan had been devised by a narrow group of officials detached from market realities. \"I still believe the trial programme will end in failure,\" he said.

        "debiased_text": "Chinese stock market regulators introduced measures yesterday to address investor concerns regarding a new plan to sell part of the state's equity holdings. The market responded cautiously to the proposal. One of the four companies participating in the pilot program announced compensation for existing investors to mitigate potential stake dilution. Separately, a state newspaper indicated that regulators might suspend new initial public offerings (IPOs) for several months to avoid oversupplying the market with shares. These steps follow past regulatory attempts to reduce state equity holdings, which constitute approximately two-thirds of listed Chinese companies' equity and have historically influenced market development. Four years ago, a previous proposal by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to sell non-tradeable shares was withdrawn after market declines. The current plan involves a smaller-scale pilot program, with gradual sales of state shares contingent on shareholder approval. The initial participants are mid-size companies. The China Securities Journal reported that domestic IPOs could be paused for two months. The CSRC did not confirm this report. Among the four participating firms, Sany Heavy Industries stated it would compensate existing shareholders with additional shares and cash. Market reactions were mixed, with the Shanghai Composite Index initially falling 2.4% on Monday but closing 0.5% higher the following day. Analysts offered differing perspectives on the plan. Stephen Green of Standard Chartered described the approach as a balance between short-term challenges and long-term benefits. Zhao Danyang of Guotai Junan Asset Management noted that corporate governance improvements would require time. Critics, including Zhang Weixing of China Huadian Investment Consulting, questioned the plan's design and feasibility.

The broadcast of the eight free concerts being staged in London, Philadelphia, Paris, Rome, Berlin, Johannesburg, Tokyo and Toronto on Saturday will be available in more than 140 countries. Those without tickets will be able to see or hear the concerts on television, radio, online or their mobile phones. Producers estimate that 85 per cent of the world's population will be able to see the live broadcast. The viewing figures will smash all previous records. The 2004 Athens Olympic Games were watched by 3.9 billion people worldwide, the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales reached 2.5 billion, while the Oscars' biggest audience was 1.5 billion. Kevin Wall, executive producer of Live8, said: 'This monumental live broadcast is without doubt the largest global live transmission in history. Everyone in the world will have the opportunity to view and interact with this groundbreaking event and we will come together to have our voices heard and eliminate extreme poverty.' Organisers also revealed that Gael García Bernal, star of The Motorcycle Diaries , Oscar-nominated actor Pete Postlethwaite, Lord of the Rings actor Billy Boyd, pop star Daniel Bedingfield and human rights campaigner Bianca Jagger will be among those joining the Make Poverty History rally in Edinburgh on Saturday. Broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby and musician Billy Bragg will host stages at the event, which is expected to attract tens of thousands of people to the city. Film-maker Richard Curtis said: 'We have the unique opportunity to be the generation to say that enough is enough.' But it is a different story in Germany where the event organiser has expressed dismay at the lack of support of politicians or business sponsors. Marek Lieberberg said the failure meant the bands performing at the concert risked having to pay for the £663,000 show themselves. The Berlin event is due to feature Green Day, Roxy Music, A-ha and Brian Wilson. But Lieberberg told Germany's Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper: 'One can only feel shame. In England and America there has been incredible support from business and politics for this thing.' Live8 and The Long Walk to Justice is targeting the leaders of eight of the world's richest countries as they meet for the G8 Summit in Gleneagles on 6-8 July. A further concert will be staged in Edinburgh on 6 July. With the G8's willingness to confront the issue of climate change also under intense scrutiny, Downing Street's efforts to secure an agreement look set to be pushed to the last possible moment. The focus is on bolting on as many specific agreed commitments as possible to a communique whose general text has been agreed for some weeks. Specifically, the organisers would like a formal US- backed commitment to the science of climate change, that it is occurring and at least partly man-made. At present the main public success on climate change is likely to be the first high profile meeting on the issue involving the leaders of the United States as well as the new giant developing economies of China, India, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa. In a statement to The Observer yesterday, Tony Blair said: 'By bringing together for the first time the leaders of the G8 and these major emerging economies, the Gleneagles Summit will set the stage for a more concerted global effort to tackle climate change.'",

        "title": "Is cinema dead?",
        "original_text": "Is this the future of cinema-going? Photograph: Getty Is cinema dead? And, no, I don't mean that metaphorically. I'm not asking if film is creatively dead (although, given that a little birdie tells me that a sequel to Drop Dead Fred is in the pipeline, perhaps that is what I really mean). Neither am I harking back to those glory days of the 70s, when Hollywood was apparently made up entirely of radical auteurs like Scorsese, Coppola and, er, Spielberg. I literally mean, is cinema dead? Do we no longer enjoy the thrill of finding ourselves in a darkened room with hundreds of strangers, waiting eagerly to discover what cinematic delights are in store for us? Obviously a few of these arguments are well rehearsed. DVD sales are now a huge part of the Hollywood marketing machine – an estimated 60% of revenue from the US came in home sales, compared to 23% for tickets. While the opening weekend extravaganza is as important as ever for summer blockbusters like Star Wars III, any number of films now do as much, if not more, business on the small screen. And, of course, there's that old problem for Hollywood of piracy (oddly not something that Joe Public is losing too much sleep over), which meant that Star Wars was available on DVD across the world just hours after it hit the cinema. Some film-makers are already taking the fight to the pirates. Witness Steven Soderbergh's latest project. In conjunction with 2929 Entertainment, Soderbergh will make six experimental films and simultaneously release them in the cinema and on DVD. Now, you might think that the fact that Soderbergh wants to release a few arthouse films on DVD isn't going to have Hollywood shaking in its boots. But, that's not taking into account that the two men behind 2929 Entertainment, Mark Cuban and Todd Wagner, know a fair bit about making cash in the digital era. After all, they sold Broadcast.com for a hell of a lot of money to Yahoo! back in 1999, before the bubble burst. And they know that plenty of you would far sooner sit in front of the TV than schlep over to the cinema to check out the latest release. Given that we're hardly in a golden age of cinema, who can blame the humble viewer who doesn't want to shell out up to a tenner for a film that is as likely as not to be utter tosh? It makes more sense to rent it, download, or, though of course we're not recommending this, copy it from a friend ... Hollywood may not be as digitally savvy as it likes to think, but it knows a threat when it sees one. Warner, for example, has just released a film on DVD in China on the same day it came out in the cinema in the US, in a bid to stay one step ahead of those pesky pirates. OK, so the film was only The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants, but it's the first time something like this has happened, and they're surely only testing the water ahead of bigger releases. Sony released Kung Fu Hustle on DVD in China just a month after it came out in the cinema, and are apparently rather pleased with the resulting sales. Cinema owners are understandably unmoved by this idea, what with their vested interest in getting bums on seats, and some have refused to screen films that are to be released simultaneously on DVD. But the challenge is up to them to make the cinema-going experience a more enjoyable one. Bigger seats, cheaper tickets, and so on, would go some way to improving the matter. But can they compete with the comforts of home, where you can drink and smoke to your heart's content, shout at the screen, and answer your mobile phone should you so desire? All of which sounds like a midnight screening I once went to in King's Cross.",
        "debiased_text": "Recent trends in the film industry have raised questions about the future of cinema. Data shows that DVD sales account for an estimated 60% of Hollywood's revenue in the U.S., compared to 23% from ticket sales. While opening weekends remain significant for major releases like Star Wars III, many films now generate comparable or greater revenue through home media. Piracy has also become a concern, with some films appearing on DVD globally shortly after their theatrical release. Some filmmakers are exploring new distribution models. Director Steven Soderbergh, working with 2929 Entertainment, plans to release six experimental films simultaneously in theaters and on DVD. The founders of 2929 Entertainment, Mark Cuban and Todd Wagner, have experience in digital media, having sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999. Warner Bros. recently released The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants in China on DVD the same day as its U.S. theatrical debut, an attempt to address piracy concerns. Sony similarly released Kung Fu Hustle on DVD in China one month after its theatrical premiere, with reportedly positive sales results. Some cinema owners have opposed simultaneous releases due to concerns about theater attendance, emphasizing the need to improve the movie-going experience through factors like seating and pricing."

        "original_text": "Village democracy is one of the rallying cries of modern China, and, if the northeastern village of West Tian Ge is typical, democracy is more than just a word here. But not too much more than a word: the Communist Party still maintains an iron grip on the levers of power.\nParty leadership in this village has both promoted elections and led to resentment about the way elections are run. Last year's election for village chief ran into difficulties when the voters concluded that the party secretary had rigged the balloting to get his own man into office. Their response was to boycott the election, while the secretary, insisting all was on the up and up, made numerous attempts to get them to turn out.\nUltimately a deal was reached, though only after the village was awash in police from the nearby county seat. A final vote was eventually accepted by all factions as legitimate, but the winner was an elderly gentleman widely regarded as ineffectual. He won because he belonged to the local clan with the largest membership.\nNow, comments from all sides indicate that village governance is paralyzed because of the uninspired leadership of the village chief, and the rivalry between his clan and that of the party secretary's.\nThe rebirth of clans is one of the surprises of reform era China. These kin groups had been prominent in Chinese politics for more than 2,000 years. But the Communist Party dismantled them in the 1950s, and for a couple of decades it did seem that they had been wiped out for good.\nHowever, they're definitely back now as men and women acquire resources, and make it a point to share them with fellow clan members. It was one of these kin-based alliances, that of the Du clan, that helped throw confusion into the 2003 election for West Tian Ge's village chief.\nThere are clear signs that village China enjoys a degree of freedom previously unknown under Communist rule. The peasants of West Tian Ge are fairly well-informed about national and foreign affairs, and they are unafraid to openly criticize their government. Any observer would likely be convinced of this by listening to the spirited debate at West Tian Ge's restaurant on a typical evening:\n\"Chairman Mao was our greatest leader. He liberated China from the foreigners.\"\n\"No, he held China's economy back. Deng Xiaoping was much better.\"\n\"History shows that the Tiananmen crackdown was the right thing to do. China needs stability.\"\n\"No! Stability doesn't come from shooting people in the streets.\" And so on.\nOne of the great ironies here is that the Chinese Communist Party has become the de facto Chinese Conservative Party. Its policies resemble those of conservative parties elsewhere in the world: an aggressive nationalism, restraints on political change for the sake of stability and promotion of the interests of wealthy elites.\nPerhaps the most surprising political trend in China is the alliance between the Communist Party and the moneyed class. Recently, this relationship was formalized with legislation that specifically welcomed capitalists into the ranks of the party.\nThe conservative-Communist link is apparent at the village level. In West Tian Ge, for example, the village council, headed by the village chief, consists mainly of popularly elected officials. But the real power is in the hands of the party secretary who is appointed by higher level party leaders.\nMuch of the party secretary's power comes from his control of the local economic council, the body any investor must deal with in order to set up a village enterprise. This means the party secretary is a powerful insider when it comes to investments and to private cash flows in the village economy. It is this kind of relationship that has made many a party official wealthy in today's China.\nChairman Mao, the revolutionary leader who founded the People's Republic of China, famously said that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. That may well have been true in 1949, but in 2005 it would be more accurate to say that political power grows out of the bank account of the private investor. Mao also stipulated that \"The party must control the gun.\" In China today, it is the flow of cash that the party is most anxious to control.\nRobert L. Moore, a native of Lakeland, is doing research in China. He is a professor of anthropology at Rollins College and director of international relations for that college's Holt School.",
        "debiased_text": "The village of West Tian Ge in northeastern China has experienced developments in local governance and elections. Village elections are part of China's grassroots democracy system, where the Communist Party plays a leading role. In last year's election for village chief, some voters raised concerns about the fairness of the process, leading to a temporary boycott. After negotiations and a police presence from the nearby county, a final vote was conducted and accepted by all parties. The elected village chief is an elderly man from the village's largest clan.\n\nCurrent discussions among villagers indicate challenges in village governance, including perceptions of ineffective leadership and tensions between different clan groups. The re-emergence of clan influence has been noted in various parts of rural China since the reform era, after being largely absent during earlier decades of Communist rule.\n\nIn West Tian Ge, villagers demonstrate awareness of national and international affairs, with various opinions expressed in public discussions. These discussions include differing views on historical events and economic policies.\n\nThe governance structure in West Tian Ge includes both elected village officials and appointed party positions. The village party secretary, appointed by higher-level party authorities, holds significant influence through control of local economic matters, including oversight of village enterprises. This structure reflects the Communist Party's ongoing role in local economic development.\n\nRecent policy changes in China have formalized relationships between the Communist Party and private entrepreneurs. At the village level, this is manifested through party officials' involvement in economic decision-making processes."

        "title": "Andrew Rawnsley: Don't call him Margaret Thatcher",
        "original_text": "There is a way of looking at the acrimonious failure of the European summit as a great triumph for Tony Blair. The rebate is preserved. The last rites have been performed over the European constitution. A vicious bust-up with Jacques Chirac excites approving headlines about the Prime Minister bulldogging for Britain. Tony Blair has finally turned into Margaret Thatcher. Once upon a time, this interpretation of events might have appealed to some in Number 10, but Thatcheresque comparisons are precisely not the ones the Prime Minister wants people to make this weekend. She would return from summits and crow to MPs about how violently she had cracked the heads of the rest of Europe with her steel-plated handbag. When he appears in the Commons tomorrow, he will not revel in the deadlock at the summit. He will regret it. He can hardly deny that it was an encounter of epic bitterness between the leading players. Blair was spitting with fury on Friday night about what he saw as an attempt by the French, aided and abetted by Luxembourg and Germany, to organise a 24-to-one gang bang of Britain. But he still sees himself, and wants to be seen, as the good European. He was mightily relieved when the opposition of the Dutch, the Swedes and others to Europe's spending plans meant that Britain was not compelled to wield the veto. Where Margaret Thatcher gloried in isolation, this Prime Minister's instinctive preference is always to try to make friends. This is not just temperament. It is also a political imperative. He is going to need as many friends in other countries as he can muster if he is going to achieve anything with the British presidency of the EU which begins in July. At the post-summit press conference in the early hours of Saturday morning, the remarks in which he invested the greatest passion were about Europe having to modernise by making itself more competitive in the world and more meaningful to its own citizens. In saving Europe from itself, he thinks he has found a new mission. I say it is a new mission. It might be more accurate to describe this as a new old mission. He will formally outline the British aims for its presidency in an address to the European parliament this Thursday. That speech, I'm told, has yet to be drafted. He could take down from the shelf a speech he has already delivered, more than seven years ago, to the French National Assembly. In March 1998, Tony Blair was warning: 'You do not have to be a Eurosceptic, in any shape or form, to appreciate the deep concern among our peoples as to how they make sense and relate to the new Europe. They worry about their national identity. They find, let us be frank, Brussels and the European institutions often remote and unsympathetic. They ask what Europe does for them.' Blair has not fulfilled his ambition of drawing the Euroscepticism from Britain. He has not found the answer at home, but he did pose the correct question about the European Union. Time has proved him right that European institutions have not made themselves matter to the people they are supposed to serve. What he said then anticipated the rejection of the constitutional treaty in the French and Dutch referendums, that raspberry which voters delivered with the force of a tornado to their elites. Instead of addressing the gulf between rulers and governed, the summit emphasised that chasm by presenting a spectacle of the leaders wrangling bitterly in the foetid chambers of a Brussels conference centre. There are factors now working to Mr Blair's advantage in proselytising his case for a reformed Europe. There is a much bigger audience for asking some fundamental questions. Why does the EU spend seven times as much subsidising farmers as it does on science, technology, skills and education put together? Is that an intelligent response to competition in world markets with the United States and the 21st-century challenge posed by China and India? That argument is beginning to resonate widely. It would be naive to expect rapid, radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. You will wait for the Eurocows to come home. I certainly can't see it happening in the next six months. But reform is back on the table, not least thanks to Jacques Chirac's attempt to use the British rebate as a diversionary tactic to deflect the humiliation of his own referendum defeat. The French President knew what response he could expect when he called for Britain to offer up its rebate as 'a gesture of solidarity'. There are many gestures his antagonist in Number 10 might like to use towards the French President. Solidarity is not one of them. Jacques Chirac's term at the Elysée expires in the summer of 2007. For those trying to put a date on when Mr Blair might choose to leave Downing Street, it wouldn't be a bad bet to assume that a milestone he'd like to pass before he retires is seeing the back of Jacques. Before then, Chirac will have been deprived of his ally in Germany. Gerhard Schröder is a dead man walking. Unless he can pull off the most sensational of comebacks, the German Chancellor will lose the election he brought forward to September. By staging a meeting with Angela Merkel, the Christian Democrat challenger, Tony Blair has made a very public forecast of the German election result, as well as trampling on the convention of not interfering in other countries' campaigns. 'Ger', as Tony used to call the German Chancellor when they were sucking up to each other, took it understandably badly that the Prime Minister should give such a public endorsement to his opponent. It helped to account for why Schröder was in such a foul temper with Blair in Brussels. The Prime Minister has never been one to let a past friendship get in the way of making a new ally. He believes that the 'Iron Fraulein' will be a good fit with his agenda, as will Nicolas Sarkozy, the man he expects to become the next President of France. So they may be. In the meantime, Mr Blair worries that he is now going to find it more difficult to get agreement at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles. He is going to have to deal with a German Chancellor and a French President with whom he has terminally fallen out and who are, in the words of one Number 10 official, 'totally resistant' to the Prime Minister's ideas for resolving the crisis in the European Union. He will find allies among other states, but he also needs to be careful not to confuse the readiness of European leaders to listen to Britain with a willingness to be told what to do by Britain. A primary challenge is to get Europe to stop talking only about things that obsess the elite and start addressing issues, like jobs, that interest its citizens, especially the millions of them who are unemployed. When Britain had the chair of the EU in 1998, it was styled, in the ineffable New Labour way, a 'people's presidency'. It was typified by a launch at Waterloo station; no concessions to French sensitivities there. The only other memorable moment was a row with the Italians who resented being represented on the commemorative tie by a slice of pizza. If Tony Blair is again to try a 'people's presidency', he will need some better ideas than that. He will find fellow travellers among other European leaders for his vision of a less navel-gazing, more outward-looking Europe, but he will also encounter large road blocks. The French voters who rejected the constitution did so not because they thought it was too Blairite. Europe, rather like the Prime Minister, prefers to function by consensus. It is in the nature of the beast that this is the only way that it can operate. The grandstanding and backstabbing in Brussels about the budget were the symptoms of a much more profound division about where Europe goes now. About that, there is no consensus. Tony Blair, man with the mission, knows where he wants to lead Europe. The test of his statesmanship will be whether he can persuade Europe to follow.",
        "debiased_text": "The European summit ended without agreement, with key issues such as the UK rebate and EU spending plans remaining unresolved. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair preserved the UK's budget rebate, while discussions on the European constitution were shelved. Disagreements between Blair and French President Jacques Chirac were noted during negotiations, with France, Luxembourg, and Germany advocating for changes to the UK's financial arrangements. Blair emphasized the need for EU modernization to enhance competitiveness and relevance to citizens. Opposition from the Netherlands, Sweden, and others prevented Britain from needing to use its veto on spending plans. Blair's upcoming EU presidency, beginning in July, will focus on reform priorities, including economic competitiveness. The summit highlighted ongoing divisions among EU leaders regarding budgetary priorities, particularly agricultural subsidies versus investment in innovation. Blair has previously raised concerns about the EU's disconnect with public concerns, as seen in the rejection of the constitutional treaty in French and Dutch referendums. Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's political position in Germany remains uncertain, with Blair engaging opposition leader Angela Merkel ahead of Germany’s early election. Preparations for the G8 Summit in Gleneagles may face challenges due to strained relations between Blair, Schröder, and Chirac. The EU continues to debate its future direction, with differing views among member states on policy priorities and reform."

Celine Charveriat, head of Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign, said that, with less than six months to go before the World Trade Organisation summit in Hong Kong, negotiators were \"miles from consensus\" on farm subsidies, market access and food aid. \"Development is in danger of being deleted from the [Doha development] round and failure is not far away unless the stops are pulled out now,\" she said as the WTO gathered for a \"mini-ministerial\" meeting in Dalian, China.

He insisted that opposing positions were not hardening. Ms Charveriat countered that the G8 rhetoric was \"sadly mismatched\" with the WTO negotiations where \"rich country intransigence and self-interest is blocking progress\". The European commission will propose tomorrow that groups of EU states pool resources to fund projects including rail and road links in Africa.

Celine Charveriat of Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign stated that, with less than six months remaining before the World Trade Organisation summit in Hong Kong, disagreements persist on farm subsidies, market access, and food aid. She noted that progress in the Doha development round could be at risk without immediate action. The remarks were made as the WTO convened a 'mini-ministerial' meeting in Dalian, China. Separately, EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson suggested that the G8 Gleneagles summit’s focus on development might lead to advancements in agriculture, market access, subsidies, and manufacturing tariffs. He added that opposing positions were not becoming more entrenched. Charveriat responded that the G8’s stated commitments were not aligning with the WTO negotiations, where disagreements among wealthier nations were hindering progress. The European Commission is expected to propose a plan for EU states to combine resources for infrastructure projects in Africa, which could reduce administrative costs by 25% and improve aid efficiency."

        "title": "US v China: the next superbout",
        "original_text": "Ever since 9/11 the US and China have been rubbing along nicely. The US needed China's support in the war against terror, and China is anxious to create the best conditions for its economic growth. But how long will this latest honeymoon last? A string of recent announcements coming out of Washington suggest that the Bush administration may be adopting a rather more abrasive position. First, China was attacked for the huge wave of textile imports that followed the lifting of the global quota agreement at the beginning of the year, a decision the US had 10 years to prepare for. The US has now imposed quotas on Chinese textiles, as has the EU. Meanwhile the US treasury has demanded that China revalue the yuan within the next six months, describing its currency policies as \"highly distortionary\". In fact, even if China does revalue the yuan, it will make precious little difference to America's huge current account deficit. Moreover China's own current account is broadly in balance, suggesting that the case for revaluation is hardly overwhelming. Earlier this month the US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, claimed that Chinese military spending was much higher than officially admitted, questioned the motives behind the increased expenditure, and called on Beijing to embrace a \"more open and representative government\". Two weeks earlier it had been reported that the Pentagon is preparing to release a report on the Chinese military that warns that the US should take more seriously the possibility that China might emerge as a strategic rival to America: indeed, such was the tenor of the report that it has generated some controversy within the Bush administration. Before 9/11 the incoming Bush administration had adopted an aggressive stance towards China, describing it as a \"strategic competitor\" rather than the \"strategic partner\" preferred by the Clinton administration. But 9/11 brought that to an abrupt end: for almost four years the relationship between the two countries has been relatively mellow. But perhaps that period is also now drawing to a conclusion. To regard Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida as a serious threat to the US was absurd. China is a different matter altogether. Bin Laden was never going to pose even the most minuscule threat to the position of the US as the sole superpower. China clearly could, and in the long run certainly will. Its growing economic power will, in time, underpin wider political and military ambitions. A strong sense of this is already evident in east Asia. Since 9/11 China has been extremely proactive and sophisticated in the way it has gone about seeking to enhance its position in east and south Asia, concluding a series of agreements, notably with India, Indonesia and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean), aimed at better ties. No global power ever gives up its power voluntarily. The US will be no exception. On the contrary, having defeated the USSR in the cold war and now glorying in its status and power as the sole superpower, it will defend its position with ruthless determination. The growing conflict between an extant America and a rising China will become the dominant fault line of global politics. We are not entering a period of calm; the contrary in fact. The lines of future conflict are already anticipated in a Pentagon review of America's military needs leaked by the Wall Street Journal in March: the review explicitly commits to the idea of huge military spending as a way of deterring would-be superpowers, with China explicitly mentioned. Given the huge military expenditure of the US, Rumsfeld's hypocrisy in criticising China's limited military budget is manifest: the swagger of the sole superpower. But even if this pessimism proves correct, we should not expect a simple rerun of the cold war. There may be obvious similarities, notably that the US will once again be one of the protagonists and that China is ruled by a communist party. But there the similarities end. First, China's economy is immeasurably stronger than the Soviet Union's ever was and its growth is continuing at breakneck speed: economic strength is the key precondition for global power and influence. Second, unlike the Soviet Union, which chose confrontation and autarky, China has opted for global integration and its own form of capitalism. As a consequence, China is already deeply entwined with the global economy. It is the biggest exporter to the US, the largest recipient of foreign direct investment and the main reason why the US is presently able to live with a huge budget deficit and enjoy an enormous house price bubble. The US's relationship with China is strangely symbiotic in a way that its relationship with the Soviet Union never was. Perhaps this will act as some kind of constraint. But as China and the US bump against each other in a growing number of regions and over an expanding number of issues - trade and financial imbalances between the two, oil and natural resources in Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, regional competition in east Asia, not to mention Taiwan and Japan - then this will become progressively more difficult and relations will become increasingly fraught. It is not impossible, indeed, that the rise of China will undermine the advantages of globalisation in the American mind - as the US economist Clyde Prestowitz has recently suggested - leading to increasing acrimony, the end of globalisation as we know it, and a rising tide of protectionism. The prospect of decades of political tension lies ahead. It will require enormous willpower on the part of the US, China, the EU and Japan to contain those tensions. China will be demonised for its political system and its profound cultural differences - for the first time in modern history a non-white, non-European-based society will be a global superpower. The West will need to learn to live with difference rather than seeking to denounce and subjugate it. The US will need to learn to contain its primordial desire to have an enemy, be it Native Americans, the Soviet Union, Bin Laden or China. Otherwise the 21st century will be grim indeed.",
        "debiased_text": "Following the events of September 11, 2001, the United States and China maintained cooperative relations. The U.S. sought China's support in counterterrorism efforts, while China focused on creating favorable conditions for its economic growth. However, recent developments suggest shifts in U.S. policy toward China. The U.S. imposed quotas on Chinese textile imports after the lifting of global quotas, a measure also adopted by the EU. The U.S. Treasury has called for China to revalue its currency within six months, describing current policies as 'highly distortionary,' though economic data indicates China's current account is broadly balanced. U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld recently stated that China's military spending exceeds official figures and questioned the motives behind the increases, urging China to adopt more open governance. Earlier, a Pentagon report suggested China could become a strategic rival to the U.S., a view that has sparked debate within the Bush administration. Prior to 9/11, the Bush administration viewed China as a 'strategic competitor,' but relations improved for nearly four years afterward. Economic growth and regional agreements, such as those with India, Indonesia, and ASEAN, have bolstered China's influence in East and South Asia. The U.S., as the sole superpower, is expected to defend its global position. A Pentagon review highlighted the need for military spending to deter potential superpowers, explicitly naming China. U.S.-China relations differ from Cold War dynamics, as China's economy is significantly stronger and more integrated globally than the Soviet Union's was. China is the largest exporter to the U.S. and a major recipient of foreign investment. Tensions may arise over trade imbalances, competition for resources in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, and regional issues involving Taiwan and Japan. Some analysts suggest China's rise could lead to increased protectionism and a reevaluation of globalization's benefits. Managing these tensions will require cooperation from the U.S., China, the EU, and Japan."

        "original_text": "China has given the official go-ahead for the sale of the state's huge holdings in quoted companies, which account for about two- thirds of the equity in businesses with a stock market value of Dollars 400bn (Pounds 210bn). The China Securities Regulatory Commission said in a statement posted on its website that rules taking effect immediately would allow a small number of companies to take part in a trial programme of state share sales. The long-awaited guidelines say that the regulator and two- thirds of shareholders have to approve sales of state shares, giving the commission and existing shareholders a veto over disposals. Buyers of state shares will not be able to sell their stake in the first year, and after that will be restricted to sales of a maximum of 5 per cent of a company's equity in each 12-month period. The regulator did not specify which companies or sectors would be eligible to participate in the trial programme, which is intended to allay fears of the potential impact on share prices of a sudden disposal of state holdings. It also made no reference to proposals reported in China's state-owned media for a suspension of initial public offerings and other share sales during the trial period. The rules mark China's third effort to resolve the problem of state shareholdings, which include stock held by the central and provincial governments, cities and other state-owned companies. Regulators experimented with ways of selling state shares in 1999 and 2001, but had to abandon the attempt, in part because of a sharp drop in market values. Analysts said the likely impact of the latest proposals would be difficult to gauge until individual companies produced detailed proposals. However, the announcement appeared to have been timed to minimise market disruption. It was made at the start of a week-long national holiday when markets will be closed. The Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges have performed poorly this year, with the Shanghai Composite index down about 8 per cent and the Shenzhen market 10 per cent lower. The government had for years been deeply divided on how to reform capital markets.",

        "original_text": "Thousands of demonstrators blocked a major road for a fourth day today to protest against an opposition candidate's exclusion from Kyrgyzstan's parliamentary elections this weekend. Tensions have been mounting in the central Asian nation, where a radio station had its broadcasts blocked yesterday, and a printing house that produces many of Kyrgyzstan's independent newspapers had its power cut and accused the government of interference. Rising anger is fuelling speculation that this largely Muslim nation could see an outbreak of post-election demonstrations similar to November's \"orange revolution\" in Ukraine that was sparked by election fraud. Today some 3,000 supporters of opposition politician Arslanbek Maliyev stepped up their protests by erecting dozens of checkpoints to halt traffic along a main highway after the country's supreme court rejected an appeal against Mr Maliyev's disqualification from Sunday's poll. Yesterday 2,000 demonstrators supporting opposition candidate Akylbek Japarov massed near the town of Kochkor in eastern Kyrgyzstan to continue their blockade of a key road link with China, a major trading partner. \"We are ready to march to [the capital] Bishkek,\" said 50-year-old farmer Joldoshbek Mokoyez, who said he had been at the blockade for three days. \"It is the central authorities who are to blame. We only want justice.\" Sunday's vote is a crucial test for Kyrgyzstan, once seen as an island of democracy in former Soviet central Asia but now troubled by alleged repression. It will be closely watched, not only for its own importance but as an indicator of how the country's presidential election in October is likely to be conducted. Both Russia and the US have military bases in Kyrgyzstan. News media, drawing on Ukraine and on Georgia's \"rose revolution\" of 2003, have christened Kyrgyzstan's potential uprising the \"tulip revolution\". As in Ukraine, opposition leaders have complained that the government is preventing equal access to the media. Yesterday the director of the Kyrgyz service of US-funded Radio Liberty said the authorities had force the station's broadcasts off the air, silencing the main alternative source of news to much of the country. The station is popular in remote rural areas. The printing house that experienced power cuts this week is run by the Media Support Centre, a program of US-based rights human group Freedom House. A reduced printing schedule was resumed on Wednesday using power supplied by generators rented from the US embassy. The operation prints some of Kyrgyzstan's most prominent independent and opposition-inclined newspapers, including the paper MSN, which Kyrgyz president Askar Akayev has threatened to sue for libel. \"You can see the pattern ... it's a direct attempt to prevent us from printing ahead of the election,\" said programme director Michael Stone. President Akayev and other government officials have come under increasing criticism for allegedly hindering opposition candidates' election campaigns and for disqualifying several prominent opposition figures from the poll. Earlier this week, supporters of another disqualified candidate blocked another major road, slowing production at the Kumtor gold mine, a key element of the economy. Another leading opposition figure, Roza Otunbayeva, has also been denied registration. The grounds quoted were that she did not meet the requirement of having been a resident for the last five years, despite the fact that she had been posted as a diplomat in Britain and the US during her absence. Ms Otunbayeva had intended to run for election in the district where Mr Akayev's daughter, Bermet, is a candidate. Seen as a central figure if protests spread, Ms Otunbayeva denies that she and her colleagues in the Ata-Jurt political movement are preparing to take to the streets. \"We in the opposition aren't talking about a revolution of any kind,\" she said recently during a trip to Moscow. \"We're talking about a peaceful, constitutional change of power.\" President Akayev has put a tight lid on dissent in recent years. In 2002, police killed six demonstrators protesting the arrest of an opposition politician. The same year opposition leader Felix Kulov was jailed for 10 years on embezzlement charges. Most of Kyrgyzstan's population of 5 million lives in poverty following economic collapse in the 1990s. External debts are almost the size of its gross domestic product of $2bn and monthly salaries seldom exceed $50.",

        "original_text": "BEIJING -- China reiterated a ban on new cigarette ventures, highlighting the complexities facing foreign tobacco companies as they struggle to gain entry into the world's largest cigarette market. \"China won't approve any new cigarette plants, whether domestically funded, joint venture or wholly foreign-invested,\" said Xing Wanli, spokesman for the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration. He said there was no timetable on how long the ban would last. The statements elaborated on official comments carried by the Xinhua news agency late last year. While the world's big tobacco brands long have touted the promise of China -- home to 320 million smokers who consume one of every three cigarettes smoked world-wide -- the bureaucracy that oversees the industry so far has kept it mostly off-limits to foreign companies. Chinese regulators appear focused on consolidating the fragmented industry before introducing new competition. During the past year, they have cut the number of domestic cigarette makers to 57 from 84. \"China's tobacco companies are not as competitive as foreign ones,\" said an official with the tobacco monopoly's industrial-development research institute. \"If we let foreign companies come in, that would do harm to our domestic industry.\" Other factors argue against a hasty opening. Taxes from the sale of cigarettes, which all are made by the government-controlled monopoly, are a big contributor to state coffers. In the poor southwestern province of Yunnan, for example, tobacco taxes underwrite the local economy, and tobacco companies frequently help fund the construction of buildings and roads. China's tobacco industry made $25 billion in pretax profit last year, up nearly one-third from a year earlier. The announcement is a particularly pointed blow for British American Tobacco PLC. In July of last year, the London company said it had gained approval from China's central government and other authorities to build a $1.5 billion factory that could produce cigarettes for the domestic market. But the tobacco monopoly at the time denied that the project had proper approval. BAT said yesterday it had no specific comment about the ban. Its investment plan, the statement said, \"has gained approval from China's central government. BAT will unveil related information as soon as details are settled.\" China can afford to dictate the terms of the industry's opening. The country's market-opening promises to join the World Trade Organization contain no concessions allowing foreign companies to produce cigarettes within China. While taxes on imported cigarettes have come down, imported tobacco leaf and cigarettes first must gain approval from an import-export company under the tobacco monopoly. --- Cui Rong and Qiu Haixu in Beijing and Helena Yu in Shanghai contributed to this article.",

'China will not approve any new cigarette plants, regardless of being domestically funded, joint ventures, or wholly foreign-invested,' Wanli said, adding that there is no set timeframe for the ban's duration. The announcement follows similar remarks made by Xinhua news agency late last year.\n\nChina's tobacco market, the largest globally with approximately 320 million smokers, remains largely restricted for foreign tobacco companies. Regulatory efforts have focused on consolidating the domestic industry, reducing the number of cigarette manufacturers from 84 to 57 in the past year. An official from the tobacco monopoly's industrial-development research institute noted that domestic firms are less competitive than foreign ones and that permitting foreign entry could harm local producers.\n\nTax revenue from cigarettes, produced exclusively under government control, constitutes a significant portion of state income. In provinces like Yunnan, tobacco taxes are a key economic driver, often funding infrastructure projects. The industry reported $25 billion in pretax profit last year, a nearly one-third increase from the previous year.\n\nThe ban directly affects British American Tobacco PLC (BAT), which announced in July 2023 that it received central government approval for a $1.5 billion factory in China. However, the tobacco monopoly disputed that approval had been granted. BAT stated it had no specific comment on the ban but reiterated that its investment plan had central government approval and that details would be disclosed once finalized.\n\nChina maintains control over industry regulations as its WTO accession commitments do not require allowing foreign cigarette production domestically.

        "original_text": "Chinese authorities are sending \"think again\" letters to couples applying for divorce after the number of people ending their marriages surged by 21% last year. The growing number of legal break-ups, which have increased fivefold since 1979, has raised concerns that the first generation to grow up in one-child families were so spoiled that they are unable to make the sacrifices required of marriage. According to figures released yesterday by the ministry of civil affairs, 1.6 million couples divorced in 2004, up by almost 300,000 on the previous year. Although the overall divorce rate is still lower than in Europe or the US, the long-term trend is upwards. Adultery and divorce are becoming the most talked-about subjects in China's fast-changing society. Last year's most popular soap opera was called China Style Divorce. The tale of infidelity and break-up was voted the best drama of 2004 and was watched by hun dreds of millions of viewers. Last year's steep rise was attributed mainly to simpler marriage and divorce procedures. In the past, couples needed permission from their work units to tie and untie the knot, which meant that, in 1991, two out of five divorce requests were turned down. But under the new rules, couples can obtain quick divorces from register offices by taking in their marriage certificates, ID cards, resident permits and a signed statement that they no longer want to be married. It takes 10 minutes and costs10 yuan (65p). Critics have warned that this has allowed people to rush in and out of marriage. In Shanghai, where divorces are more than double the national average, newspapers have reported on a couple who married in the morning and divorced that afternoon. Another couple reportedly married and divorced twice in a year. Sociologists say the increase in break-ups reflects wider changes as China becomes wealthier and more liberal.",
        "debiased_text": "Chinese authorities have begun sending letters to couples applying for divorce, encouraging them to reconsider their decision. This follows a 21% increase in divorce rates last year. Official data from the Ministry of Civil Affairs shows that 1.6 million couples divorced in 2004, representing an increase of nearly 300,000 from the previous year. Divorce rates in China have risen significantly since 1979, though they remain lower than in Europe or the U.S. Changes in marriage and divorce procedures, implemented to simplify the process, have contributed to the increase. Under current regulations, couples can obtain a divorce at a registration office by presenting their marriage certificates, ID cards, resident permits, and a signed statement of mutual consent—a process that takes approximately 10 minutes and costs 10 yuan (65p). Previously, couples required approval from their employers, resulting in approximately 40% of divorce requests being denied in 1991. Reports in Shanghai, where divorce rates exceed the national average, describe instances of couples divorcing shortly after marriage. Sociologists note that rising divorce rates coincide with broader societal changes as China's economy develops and social norms evolve."

This time it surrounds a Chinese group and casts doubt on the region's corporate governance progress::   [LONDON 1ST EDITION ]",
        "original_text": "The youthful Chinese man making his way up the aircraft aisle after take-off from Shanghai wanted to talk business with Lee Kuan Yew, the father of modern Singapore. The 81-year-old former prime minister, a charismatic figure who inspires both respect and fear across Asia, did not expect the stranger's approach. \"I was taken aback when he gave me his card,\" he recalls. The request was for Mr Lee's support in the purchase of a stake in Singapore Petroleum Company, a state-controlled oil refiner. The business card read: Chen Jiulin, managing director and chief executive officer, China Aviation Oil (Singapore) Corporation Ltd. A few months after that mid-air encounter, Mr Chen and his company, a jet fuel importer controlled by the Chinese state but listed in Singapore, were high-flying no longer. On December 8, the CAO chief was arrested by police in the city-state founded by Mr Lee, after his company collapsed with Dollars 550m in derivatives losses. The events have shone a spotlight on shortcomings common among Chinese state companies - flaws that are often overlooked in the general enthusiasm about the country's emergence as a global trading and economic power. By the time of Mr Chen's release a few hours later, the crash of CAO had turned into the biggest scandal to hit an overseas-listed Chinese company. The implosion of a large company once hailed as a model corporate institution is also the most serious threat to Singapore's reputation as a financial centre (see right) since the derivatives losses generated from there by Nick Leeson brought down Barings Bank of the UK in 1995. On Monday, CAO is due to present a restructuring plan aimed at convincing creditors - including Goldman Sachs of the US and Australia's Macquarie Bank - to keep it alive by forgiving more than half its Dollars 600m debt. Singapore's stock exchange and white-collar crime unit are meanwhile completing investigations on who was responsible for CAO's dash towards insolvency and for keeping shareholders and creditors in the dark. Aside from the fate of a company that last year supplied Chinese airlines with a third of their fuel is the impact the affair may have on international investors' perceptions of China. The question for investors and companies that have bought into China's dream of growth and industrialisation is whether CAO was an aberration caused by one or more \"rogue traders\" or the first of many disasters waiting to happen as the country proceeds on its rapid journey from command to market economy. \"This is a big red flag for all those looking to do business in China,\" says a creditor involved in the CAO debacle. \"There are a lot of companies in China with huge franchises which exist at the whim of state-owned parents. Are they really that much different from CAO?\" In many respects, CAO is a classic example of a Chinese state company to which the government had granted control of a market. China Aviation Oil Holding Company, its state-owned parent, has a near-total monopoly in supply of aviation fuel, and had made CAO its sole supplier of imports. That monopoly prompted investors to buy into CAO's 2001 initial public offering, which was Singapore's biggest that year. Backed by the parent, which retained three quarters of its shares, the listed company's mission was clear: use foreign capital to increase profits and expand, while keeping a strategic industry in the hands of the state. This is a familiar model, which has enabled Beijing to restructure and inject market practices into sectors that used to be economic deadweights, such as oil, telecommunications and power, without giving up ultimate control. The mix of entrepreneurial energy and state ownership has made the listed entities of China's state giants attractive for foreign investors. With a privileged position within China's economy and the hope that Beijing would support them in times of need, state-owned enterprises have been considered compelling, and relatively low- risk, investments. Like many of its peers, CAO thrived in this environment. Its profits grew by more than a third over the two-year period since the listing and its share price more than trebled, reaching a peak of SDollars 1.89 in March last year. That valued CAO at SDollars 1.8bn (USDollars 1.1bn), prompting its inclusion in a number of blue-chip indices. But in 2003, Mr Chen and his fellow directors decided to diversify away from oil into derivatives trading. The company never clarified what advantage it saw in a market in which it had no experience, but industry experts believe it thought it had spotted a lucrative niche. Chinese domestic airlines were buying derivatives from securities houses as an insurance against swings in the price of crude. By offering its own derivatives, CAO would make the group into a one- stop shop for its airline clients, while reaping substantially higher margins than by acting merely as an intermediary for fuel shipments. After becoming one of only 26 companies allowed by Chinese regulators to buy and sell derivatives overseas, CAO carried out its first deal - a bet on a fall in the oil price - in mid-2003. The trade was profitable. \"That baited the hook,\" says an industry expert. \"They decided it was too good to refuse.\" While boasting about its risk-management rules, which limited individual traders' losses to Dollars 500,000 and company-wide ones to Dollars 5m, the company got deeper into derivatives. CAO appeared invincible. Investment banks such as ABN Amro of the Netherlands and CLSA, the Asian arm of France's Credit Agricole, introduced the company to foreign investors. Its risk-management systems were voted the best among Chinese companies by China National Enterprise Federation, a quasi-government body that includes most large groups. Internally, though, the position was worsening. By the first quarter of 2004, \"the company faced potential losses of USDollars 5.8m\", according to an affidavit filed by Mr Chen at Singapore's High Court in November. The loss, caused by a sharp rise in the oil price, breached CAO's internal limit. But CAO decided to \"ride through\" the problem, placing even larger bets \"in the hope the oil market would trend downwards\", the document says. \"That was really when the die was cast for the company,\" says a financial industry insider. \"They should have stopped but instead they increased their exposure.\" With the oil price nearly doubling from the middle of 2003 - one of the steepest rises in recent memory - CAO's paper losses on derivatives trading had by mid-October reached Dollars 180m. Having already used more than Dollars 200m in cash to repay margin calls - additional capital required to cover the losses - the company did precisely what investors in state-controlled Chinese companies would expect. It asked its parent for help. But instead of injecting its own funds into the company, CAOHC sold a 15 per cent stake in CAO on the market for SDollars 196m, a 14 per cent discount to the market price, the affidavit says. Mr Chen says the sale was \"to raise capital for the margin calls\" and the proceeds of the equity placement were loaned to CAO. Yet, in its stock exchange announcement at the time, CAO did not specify the reason for the sale and a company official was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying the parent was raising cash for an \"investment they are making\". CAOHC's possible knowledge of the trading losses at the time of the share placement could expose it to charges of insider trading under Singapore's Securities and Futures Act. Despite CAO's silence, rumours of the losses began circulating in Singapore's tight-knit community of oil traders. In November, worried creditors asked to see CAO's management. Creditors say they were reassured that the parent company had requested permission from China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange to transfer funds of about Dollars 100m to CAO. As the days went by and the bail out failed to materialise, creditors were told the matter had been passed to the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (Sasac), the Chinese government body in charge of state companies. As Sasac delayed a decision - possibly to investigate the losses - a creditor, South Africa's Standard Bank, decided it would wait no longer. On November 17, it wrote to CAO threatening to open insolvency proceedings unless the company repaid the Dollars 14m it owed by December 9. With the clock ticking, and Sasac still to agree the cash injection, it was CAOHC itself that delivered the death blow. On November 24, the parent declined to approve the intended SDollars 362m loan-funded purchase of a 20.6 per cent stake in Singapore Petroleum - the deal about which Mr Chen had (to no avail) lobbied Mr Lee on board the aircraft. Without the parent's support, CAO had to seek court protection from its creditors a week later. Some view CAO's fall from grace as purely the result of a breakdown in internal controls caused by pressure to increase profits. Although Mr Chen has not been charged with any offence, his remuneration - 87 per cent of which was linked to profitability - is also seen by some analysts as a powerful incentive for the chief executive to have pushed the company beyond its limits. In this view, the CAO scandal is similar to western collapses such as Enron and WorldCom in the US and Parmalat in Italy, in which corporate hubris and disregard for shareholders led powerful managers down a reckless course. Chen Feng, chairman of HNA, one of China's four leading airline groups, is outraged by the idea that the case could undermine confidence in Chinese companies. \"This kind of thing does not just happen in China,\" he says. \"I'm sure there are as many problems in western stock markets, but they just take a different form.\" Others, however, believe China's breed of private-public giants is plagued by structural problems, typical of a country in transition between communism and capitalism. He Jun, analyst at Anbound Group, a Beijing-based consultancy, says government shareholders' inability to put effective limits on the power of state-owned enterprise (SOE) managers has become the most pressing problem facing the sector. \"What happened at CAO is very representative,\" says Mr He. \"This kind of problem is still very common among SOEs.\" He adds: \"This company looked just like a normal, listed company from another country would. But in reality, in terms of corporate governance, it was just like an old-style SOE.\" From a similar stable came the Hong Kong-listed arm of Bank of China, whose board was purged amid scandals last year; China Life, the insurer whose USDollars 3.4bn initial public offering is being investigated by US regulators; and China National Cotton Reserves, which last week revealed that wrong bets on cotton prices cost it Rmb500m (Dollars 60m). For foreign investors, the parent company's ambiguous response to, and ultimate failure to avert, CAO's collapse erodes a big attraction of SOEs. A Hong Kong-based fund manager says: \"We used to think listed SOEs were a one-way bet because the state would bail them out before they collapsed. After CAO, that is no longer true.\" China's corporate governance has improved enormously in recent years - HNA's Mr Chen describes it as \"using one year to make a decade's progress\", especially among listed companies. According to the Asia Corporate Governance Association, \"for Hong Kong- listed state-owned ... enterprises corporate transparency and investor communication have generally continued to improve\" in 2003- 04. Nevertheless, senior officials are aware of the need for further reform. An important move would be to turn Sasac - set up by the government in 2003 with the goal of \"separating ownership from management power\" - into an effective watchdog. According to state media, Sasac is seeking to develop a system providing for the potential dismissal of state managers responsible for big losses - a basic in most developed markets. But critics say Sasac is more interested in its expanding its influence on policy within the government than in the less glamorous work of policing the behaviour of state companies. \"Sasac has not yet become the real boss of the SOEs,\" says a China analyst. That view has been reinforced by its anaemic response to the CAO collapse. A January 13 speech by Li Rongrong, Sasac chairman, at a national conference on state asset management posted on the agency's website, contained not a single mention of CAO. With China preparing for its hardest equity sale yet - the privatisation of its huge and troubled state banks - this seemingly head-in-sand attitude threatens to reduce international confidence in its regulatory environment. Mr Lee, these days Singapore's minister mentor, argues that Beijing's decision to send Mr Chen back to the city state - he had fled after the scandal erupted - is encouraging. \"To me, that signals that they understand the damage that it will do them internationally if the chief executive just absconds,\" he says. \"That would reduce them to a third world standard of behaviour.\" Creditors, shareholders and other investors with a stake in China will need more than the elder statesman's words to believe CAO was an isolated excess rather than a symptom of a widespread malaise afflicting China's aspiring corporate champions. SELF-ASSURED CHIEF WHO RAILED AGAINST PARENTAL RESTRAINT In a book of essays published in 2003, Chen Jiulin, the chief executive of China Aviation Oil, complained about the stifling influence of state-owned parents on their subsidiaries. In an apparent swipe at China Aviation Oil Holding Company, CAO's controlling shareholder, Mr Chen wrote that overseas enterprises are often \"forced to abandon their plans due to restrictions made by the domestic parent\". Now, after presiding over derivatives losses of more than Dollars 550m, the 43-year-old executive will have to rely on CAOHC's help to salvage his company and his reputation. Those who met Mr Chen before the scandal describe him as a self- assured man whose ambition was only thinly disguised by personal charm. Born in China's central Hubei province, he taught himself English before passing the entrance examination to Peking University. After a postgraduate degree in law and a job as a translator, he joined CAOHC in 1993. In 1997, the holding company picked Mr Chen to revive its Singapore-based subsidiary, which he returned to profitability and led to an initial public offering in 2001. Mr Chen is a prominent figure in the Chinese business community overseas. In 2003 the World Economic Forum named him as the only mainland Chinese in a group of \"new Asian leaders\" under 45. He is one of Singapore's best-paid executives, earning about SDollars 4m (USDollars 2.4m) last year. Last August, a profile in a Singapore newspaper carried the headline, \"CAO's shine all due to one man\". As Mr Chen waits to hear whether authorities there will charge him, he must hope that blame for the company's downfall will not be similarly laid at his door. The scandal at China Aviation Oil has embarrassed Singapore, considered one of Asia's best-regulated financial markets. Critics say it has revealed shortcomings in the city-state's financial liberalisation, such as the way rules on the listing of foreign companies have been eased. The case of CAO has also raised questions about the role of independent directors and laws governing corporate transparency. \"Actively promoting good corporate governance is critical to safeguard Singapore's reputation,\" says David Gerald, head of the Securities Investors Association of Singapore. But Singapore's authorities have to balance the need for any tightening of the rules with the rising competitive threat from exchanges such as Tokyo and London, particularly for listings of Chinese companies. Officials so far have given little sign that rules will be changed. \"I would not, as a knee-jerk response every time something goes wrong, say 'tighten the rules'. This was our old attitude . . . I think that's not possible,\" says Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister and the main architect of financial liberalisation. The Singapore Exchange (SGX) has lobbied foreign companies, particularly from China, to list. The city-state's small domestic market means foreign listings are seen as crucial if the exchange is to become a leading financial hub. In an effort to attract companies the Singapore Exchange switched from a merit-based system for listings to one relying on corporate disclosure that puts more onus on investors to adopt a \"buyer beware\" attitude. CAO proved the system was vulnerable. It did not reveal in its last quarterly report in November that it was facing mounting losses on oil derivatives trading, which triggered its collapse. Moreover, CAO's independent directors apparently failed to stop the misleading statement from being issued. Although the Singapore Exchange and Singapore's white-collar crime unit have launched investigations into the scandal, there are questions as to whether they will be able to launch prosecutions in connection with violations of Singapore's securities laws. China Aviation Oil Holding Company (CAOHC), CAO's Beijing-based parent, may have engaged in insider trading when it sold CAO shares in October because it allegedly knew of the derivatives losses. But Singapore may lack jurisdictional authority to pursue a case against CAOHC since the parent company is neither listed nor incorporated in the city-state. The legal loopholes are prompting calls for a review of corporate and securities laws. There are suggestions that listing rules should become tougher for foreign companies if Singapore lacks authority to take action against companies incorporated overseas. There are also proposals for independent directors to undergo training to help spot abuses. Even if Singapore does not act to tighten rules, its financial markets are likely to pay a price for the CAO scandal. Local investors have become cautious about Chinese stocks listed in Singapore, since two-thirds of them have fallen below their initial public offering price. Chinese companies are expected to reconsider IPOs in Singapore due to investor reaction. In addition, Singapore, the centre for oil derivatives trading in Asia, has seen the volume of derivatives swaps fall by 35 per cent since the scandal erupted as players demand letters of credit from Chinese firms and cut contract sizes. With oil trades still not regulated, the Singapore Exchange is likely to accelerate moves to establish an oil futures exchange in co-operation with the New York Mercantile Exchange to provide oversight.

        "debiased_text": "A Chinese man approached Lee Kuan Yew, former prime minister of Singapore, during a flight from Shanghai to discuss a business proposal regarding Singapore Petroleum Company. The man was Chen Jiulin, then managing director and CEO of China Aviation Oil (Singapore) Corporation Ltd. Several months after this encounter, Chen was arrested in Singapore on December 8 following the collapse of his company, which reported $550 million in derivatives losses. The incident drew attention to operational challenges faced by some Chinese state-owned enterprises. Chen was released hours later, and the case became a significant event for overseas-listed Chinese companies. CAO, a jet fuel importer controlled by China's government but listed in Singapore, later filed for court protection from creditors. The company was scheduled to present a restructuring plan to creditors, including Goldman Sachs and Macquarie Bank, proposing to forgive over half of its $600 million debt. Investigations by Singapore's stock exchange and white-collar crime unit focused on determining responsibility for the company's financial troubles. The case raised questions about corporate governance practices in Chinese state-owned enterprises transitioning to market-oriented operations. CAO had initially appeared successful after its 2001 IPO in Singapore, with profits growing significantly in subsequent years. However, in 2003 the company expanded into derivatives trading without prior experience in this area. After reporting potential losses of $5.8 million in Q1 2004 due to rising oil prices, CAO continued trading with increased exposure. By mid-October 2004, paper losses reached $180 million. The parent company, CAOHC, sold a 15% stake in CAO in October 2004 for S$196 million. When Standard Bank threatened insolvency proceedings in November 2004, CAOHC declined to provide further financial support, leading to CAO's court filing for creditor protection. The case prompted discussions about corporate governance reforms in China and listing regulations in Singapore. Singaporean authorities examined potential legal violations while considering the balance between financial regulation and market competitiveness. The incident affected investor confidence in Chinese companies listed in Singapore and temporarily reduced oil derivatives trading volume in the region."

Last month the board of of Newton, Iowa-based Maytag announced that it had agreed to sell the company to New York-based Ripplewood Holdings LLC and three other investment companies for $1.13 billion and the assumption of $975 million in debt. But several major institutional Maytag stakeholders have indicated their unhappiness with that offer and vowed to vote against it. News that Haier was weighing a bid for Maytag was reported by the Financial Times. Maytag shares rose 10 cents to $15.34 in 4 p.m. composite New York Stock Exchange trading. The day earlier, the stock rose 5.2% on renewed speculation about possible rival bids. While some analysts have predicted that a foreign buyer might emerge, Haier hasn't been high on their lists, even though it is one of China's largest appliance makers. In the U.S., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is a major retailer of Haier refrigerators, portable dishwashers and air conditioners. Apparently seeking to address uncertainty within Maytag about its future, Chief Executive Officer Ralph Hake sent a letter to employees, saying that \"regardless of the result of the Ripplewood merger down the road,\" they should \"continue to concentrate on delivering our sales and earnings results.\" The letter, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, promised employees no change \"in the aggregate value of your benefits through the remainder of 2005.\" But as for what lies ahead, \"we simply do not have enough information at this time to have answers to your most basic questions,\" Mr. Hake said. He noted that many of those answers would appear in a preliminary proxy statement \"in the next several weeks.\" The Haier official said the company's basic strategy of acquiring foreign companies would focus on the target company's distribution network and other resources rather than acquiring a brand. \"We are selling everything with the Haier brand. We don't like big names,\" the official said. The Haier official said government officials in Shandong province, where Haier is located, and a few big banks also are involved in the research.",

        "original_text": "It should have been such a happy day. The wedding presents had been bought, a luxury yacht hired for the ceremony, and the guests - some from as far away as China - had all arrived. But then the bride and groom went and ruined it all by having everybody arrested. In fact the \"wedding\" on the yacht moored just off Atlantic City in New Jersey was an elaborate FBI sting to lure members of an international smuggling and counterfeiting ring. The bride and groom, who had been working with the accused smugglers for several years, were undercover agents. Operation Royal Charm - named after the yacht - led to the arrest of 87 people in raids across Canada and the US. Authorities said they had seized $4.4m (£2.4m) in high-quality fake $100 bills and more than 1bn counterfeit cigarettes worth $42m, as well as ecstasy, methamphetamine and Viagra worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Eight of those arrested were on their way to the fake wedding, due to begin at 2pm on Sunday, and were dressed in their finest when they were taken into custody. \"Invitations were sent out, a date was given and RSVPs were received from different points from around the world,\" Christopher Christie, a prosecutor in New Jersey, told reporters. \"One guest even bought a pair of gold Presidential Rolex watches.\" The authorities would not disclose the identities of the two undercover agents who had posed as the bride and groom, but said the pair had spent years gaining the trust of dozens of the alleged key figures at the highest level of the smuggling operation. Their cover story worked so well that the authorities decided to incorporate their \"relationship\" into their plans to close down the syndicate, Mr Christie told the Los Angeles Times. Indictments in the case describe in detail the activities of the China-based syndicate. Among those arrested were Cheng Ming \"Bruce\" Hsu and members of his extended family, who face charges of racketeering, smuggling, counterfeiting and fraud. The authorities said they were startled at the syndicate's ambition and sophistication. Of particular concern was the group's apparent ability to generate counterfeit US currency capable of fooling even the most sophisticated detection devices. The group allegedly shipped tens of millions of dollars' worth of illegal items into the US in recent years, and is alleged to have entered into a $1m deal with FBI agents to provide silenced pistols, rocket launchers, silenced submachine guns and other weapons.",

They estimate North Korea has 10,600 artillery pieces and 200 multiple rocket launchers hidden in heavily fortified caves and mountain tunnels just north of the Demilitarized Zone.\nEven though this arsenal is aging and lacks the technological sophistication of U.S. weapons, it can reach anywhere inside South Korea and may be impervious to preemptive air strikes.\nU.S. studies insist North Korea can produce significant amounts of biological and chemical weapons, and say North Korean military doctrine calls for mixing chemical and conventional munitions in an attack.\nU.S. army General Leon LaPorte, commander of Combined Forces Command Korea, has testified that, in a surprise North Korean attack, every third round fired could be a chemical weapon, designed to clear U.S. and South Korean troops out of the mountain valleys that form natural invasion routes.\nNuclear weapons could transform the military balance in Asia. North Korea might already have as many as three nuclear weapons and, if fuel from its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon is reprocessed, it could provide material for four or five more weapons.\nCombine that with North Korea's largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the developing world and a reputation for roguish behaviour and nuclear blackmail, and it's easy to understand the nervousness that has settled on Asia and the United States.",

The city also hosts museums and monuments that highlight historical events from the Korean War and emphasize military themes. The USS Pueblo, a U.S. Navy vessel captured in 1968, is displayed as a museum piece. North Korea's military, estimated at 1.2 million personnel, is one of the largest globally, following China, the United States, Russia, and India. The military receives prioritized resources under the country's 'military-first' policy. Approximately 70% of North Korean forces are stationed near the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea. The U.S. Department of Defense assesses North Korea’s military capabilities as including substantial artillery and rocket launcher deployments near the DMZ, along with potential biological and chemical weapons production. U.S. military officials have noted concerns about the operational doctrine of North Korean forces. North Korea's nuclear program and ballistic missile inventory have also been subjects of international attention."

        "original_text": "If one message emerges from Condoleezza Rice's first overseas trip as US secretary of state, it is that hopes for a new era of transatlantic harmony should not be overdone. True, the tone of conversation between Washington and its European allies has become less strident. But fundamental disagreements remain, with flashpoints looming over Iran and China. Both the US and the European Union will have to give ground to avoid relations suffering a renewed chill. On Iran, and its alleged nuclear plans, the US is for now leaving the diplomatic running to the UK, Germany and France, the EU 3. But US officials barely disguise their scepticism about Iran's intentions. And the Europeans complain that US refusal to engage in the process risks dooming it to failure. Neither side disputes the importance of averting the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran or the destabilising consequences that would spell for the Middle East. The gap concerns the broader political context. In US eyes, Iran's nuclear ambitions symbolise the determination of its theocratic rulers to subvert what George W. Bush has reaffirmed as the centrepiece of his foreign policy: remodelling the region under the banner of democracy. For the EU, they are merely an obstacle to better relations. The stick of regime change confronts the carrot of constructive engagement. If Iran is to be cajoled into changing course - far more likely with the US and EU working together - these differences must be bridged. The US must tone down the confrontational rhetoric and acknowledge Iran's legitimate security concerns; the EU must join it in issuing Tehran with practical demands such as recognition of Israel and abandonment of support for terrorist groups. As a start, the two parties need to establish a common view about regional security and Iran's role. A rational conversation is also needed about China, amid increasingly heated US protests at EU plans to lift the arms embargo imposed after Tiananmen Square. Here, US concerns are justified. Lifting the ban would send a misplaced political message to Beijing about human rights, risk inflaming security concerns across Asia about a resurgent China and fuel tensions with the US Congress over possible conflict between China and Taiwan. It would be wise, even at this late stage, for the EU to rethink lifting the ban. Failing that, member governments should put the strongest of new safeguards in place to prevent the sale of sensitive military technology to China. If not, they face the real risk that Congress will impose punitive defence trade sanctions on Europe. President Bush's second term and Ms Rice's new job offer the US and EU a chance to bury their bitter acrimony over Iraq. Both have an interest now in seeking to maximise common ground on the world's trouble-spots through dialogue rather than glossing over their differences or, worse, resorting once more to unilateral acts.",
        "debiased_text": "During Condoleezza Rice's first overseas trip as U.S. Secretary of State, discussions between the United States and its European allies appeared less confrontational than in previous interactions. However, substantive disagreements persist on issues including Iran and China. Regarding Iran's nuclear program, the U.S. has deferred primary diplomatic efforts to the UK, Germany, and France, collectively known as the EU 3. U.S. officials have expressed skepticism about Iran's intentions, while European officials have raised concerns that U.S. reluctance to participate could hinder progress. Both parties agree on the importance of preventing a nuclear-armed Iran due to potential regional instability, but they differ in their broader political approaches. The U.S. views Iran's nuclear ambitions as part of a wider strategic concern, while the EU sees them as an impediment to improved relations. On China, the U.S. has objected to EU proposals to lift an arms embargo imposed after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. U.S. officials argue that removing the embargo could weaken human rights messaging, heighten security concerns in Asia regarding China's rise, and escalate tensions over Taiwan. The EU has not yet reversed its position but could consider additional safeguards to limit technology transfers. Failure to address U.S. concerns may lead to potential U.S. congressional sanctions on European defense trade. The beginning of President Bush's second term and Secretary Rice's tenure present an opportunity for the U.S. and EU to focus on shared priorities through dialogue."

        "title": "Horse racing: China's £33m gamble under starter's orders",
        "original_text": "One of the biggest gambles in racing history is currently taking place in a country where betting has been illegal for more than half a century at a venue that regularly hosts a bloodless version of the sport that feels like a practice match. More than $60m (£33m) has already been spent on a fully functioning racing and bloodstock breeding centre in the most unlikely of settings: just outside Beijing, capital of the People's Republic of China, where gambling has been outlawed since Chairman Mao took power in 1949. So it is that several traditional mainstays of racing are thin on the ground at the meetings currently held every other Saturday at the Beijing Tongzhou Jockey Club, 35 miles outside the capital. There are professional trainers and jockeys, and thoroughbreds racing on turf manicured and tended to rival any in Britain, but no bookmakers, few individual owners and just a handful of spectators. Nor is there yet a grandstand to find shelter from the vicious sandstorms that blow in off the desert in April and May and can make outdoor life briefly unbearable on a 3,000-acre complex that was little more than a patch of scrub just five years ago. This bold scheme has had a chequered life and one false start already - more of which later - but by any standard it is a real achievement. Here on what one official describes as \"the last frontier of racing\" is an international-standard track and training and stud facilities, the fruit of what is effectively a joint venture between the state and a rich Hong Kong-based entrepreneur who obviously believes that one day he can cash in on the greatest untapped pool of gamblers in the world. Some 1,000 racehorses, many bred on site over the past five years from the centre's 24 stallions and 700 mares, are housed in huge training \"barns\". These horses are tended by a 1,000-strong workforce, ridden by homegrown jockeys taught on-site by experts, and prepared by a pool of 18 trainers, among them an improbable British representative in Nigel Smith, a 49-year-old Worcestershire farmer who came in January. \"You can call me a struggling jumps trainer, that's what I was,\" says Smith, recalling 20 years on the family farm in the village of Upper Snodsbury. After a flippant response to an advert in the Racing Post, Smith now finds himself alongside others from Ireland, France, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa among a salaried expatriate group of trainers existing on interpreters, golf, karaoke - and eight races a fortnight. Our man in China recalls: \"I wrote back to them saying that if it's got four legs, two ears and eats grass, then I can train it - and somehow I got the job from 56 applications!\" Smith drew a blank on last Saturday's card but, with a percentage of prize money being a significant part of trainers' income, he has made solid start with three winners in the first three meetings held since racing resumed in April. With no public transport links to the complex whatsoever, few would argue with its Irish director of racing Kevin Connolly's view of it as being racing's \"last frontier\". Connolly adds: \"It is a huge gamble. We're the only legal, licensed racetrack in mainland China, but this track is as good as anywhere in the world. This is a whole racing industry, from breeding to selling to racing - we're very proud of what we've achieved in a reasonably short time.\" Connolly, a former trainer, has been in Beijing since July 1999 to oversee the project for the tycoon Yun Pung Cheng, a toy-maker with extensive equine interests in Australia who has, in effect, bet the ranch that the government will rescind its ban on betting. Without that seismic shift, clearly, racing long term here is not viable even in the world's fastest growing economy. Even allowing for the radical free-market changes of the last two decades in China, gambling remains a sensitive issue and officials are wary. Hong Kong and Macao are both hotbeds of gambling, allowed there by the government under its \"one country, two systems\" policy with the former colonies, while on the mainland there is thought to be illegal gambling on a vast scale. When racing started in Beijing in August 2002, the gambling ban was got around via a \"guessing\" game, a semantic dodge that must have have had some sort of official approval as crowds of 5,000 promised to make an early success of the joint venture. But the mooted gold rush hit the buffers last year when the season was curtailed by a government investigation into illegal betting. This ongoing inquiry has not focused on the track but when racing was allowed to start up again in April it was only in a stunted form - fortnightly meetings, heavy cuts in prize money and, crucially, no guessing game. The crowds have all but vanished without the betting - sorry, \"guessing\" - as have the sales of home-bred horses to what was a slowly expanding pool of local owners beyond Cheng's own company. The action on the track now feels like a dummy run. But Connolly remains optimistic. \"OK, we're in the doldrums a bit,\" he admits. \"But we've just got to wait until things change. We can be ready at the flick of a switch.\" The £33m question now is, will the country's Communist rulers come to the party?",
        "debiased_text": "A horse racing and breeding facility has been established near Beijing, China, where gambling has been prohibited since 1949. The Beijing Tongzhou Jockey Club, located 35 miles outside the capital, represents a $60m (£33m) investment in racing infrastructure, including a turf track, training facilities, and stud operations. The complex spans 3,000 acres and houses approximately 1,000 racehorses, with 24 stallions and 700 mares used for breeding. A workforce of 1,000 manages the facility, which includes 18 trainers from various countries, including Britain, Ireland, France, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Races are currently held every other Saturday, though attendance is limited, and there is no on-site betting due to legal restrictions. The project is a collaboration between the state and a Hong Kong-based entrepreneur. Racing initially began at the venue in August 2002, with a 'guessing' game used as a workaround for betting prohibitions. However, operations were disrupted last year by a government investigation into illegal betting. When racing resumed in April, meetings were reduced to fortnightly events with lower prize money and no betting-related activities. The facility’s director of racing described the project as a significant undertaking in a market where gambling remains prohibited, emphasizing the quality of the track and infrastructure. The long-term viability of the operation may depend on potential changes to gambling regulations in China."

        "original_text": "U.S. steel imports from emerging markets have been rising even as demand and prices are slumping, increasing downward pressure on prices and prompting steelmakers to cut production to hold on to their pricing power. More imports help U.S. manufacturers of everything from appliances to auto parts, which have been hurt by the high cost of steel and other raw materials. But they are bad news for North American steelmakers, which saw prices and profits surge last year mainly because of a weak dollar -- which makes imports more expensive -- high freight rates and China's voracious demand. Still, industry observers believe a projected further drop in U.S. steel prices could discourage the world's steelmakers from shipping even more goods to the U.S. in coming months. For now, because imports typically lag behind price trends, the U.S. has become the market of choice again, as China becomes more self- sufficient and prices decline world-wide. \"Our market is not as protected as it was,\" says Timna Tanners, a steel analyst at UBS Investment Research in New York. The growth of imports is likely a reflection of higher U.S. 2004 steel prices, according to Michelle Applebaum, a steel-industry consultant based in Chicago. Steel imports into the U.S. rose to 8.87 million tons in the first four months of the year, a 23% increase from a year earlier, with the biggest surges coming from Russia, which boosted shipments threefold into the U.S. Imports from China more than doubled, while those from Brazil soared 77%. Total import numbers include semifinished steel that is turned into final products in U.S. steel mills. China's government is trying to encourage consolidation and prevent overcapacity in certain markets, such as automotive. Such moves have helped soften Chinese steel prices and caused more steel to be sent to the U.S., especially as ocean-freight rates have receded from the highs of last year. Meanwhile, shipments from U.S. steel mills to auto makers, machinery builders and steel service centers dropped 6.5% in April from the previous year, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, with only steel tubing and other products used in the oil and natural- gas industries showing an increase. John Surma, chief executive of U.S. Steel Corp. and chairman of the AISI, says the import surge means Washington trade authorities need to monitor a situation that poses a threat to \"this industry and the entire U.S. manufacturing base.\" The AISI is lobbying for continued tariffs on imports, government subsidies and restrictions on exports of key raw materials, as well as lobbying against what it considers \"unfair tax rules.\" But the Precision Metalforming Association, a trade group of manufacturers that make steel-related products, said members want more imports of hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel and are lobbying against trade protections. \"There are dozens of unnecessary import duties on steel products in places that continue to distort the U.S. market for steel,\" says Bill Gaskin, president of the group. U.S. producers, including U.S. Steel Corp., have trimmed production to stave off further price erosion. Mittal Steel Co. laid off 700 workers for eight to 10 weeks at its Weirton, W. Va., plant. Lakshmi Mittal, chief executive and chairman, says it is \"in discussions with the union at this time\" but says there aren't plans to permanently close parts of the Weirton plant. According to the Dow Jones Steel Index, spot and contract prices for hot-rolled coil steel peaked last September at about $722 a ton, including surcharges. That has since fallen to about $560 as of May. \"It's all well and good if certain producers in the U.S. decide to be more disciplined,\" says Ms. Tanners of UBS. \"But, ultimately, if our prices stay higher than the rest of the world because of the discipline, we will attract imports.\" Producers world-wide are also curtailing production. Corus Group PLC of the United Kingdom said it plans to trim production by about 175,000 tons a month in the third quarter. German steel and industrial giant ThyssenKrupp AG is predicting that steel prices will remain soft for up to five months, but believes growth in China is only pausing for the moment. Officials in China's steel industry are suggesting that steel prices in that country could start rebounding later this month as consumption remains strong. Other executives agree. \"Global demand has entered a new growth era, largely driven by China's industrialization,\" Mr. Mittal said Tuesday at an industry conference in New York hosted by Englewood Cliffs, N.J., research firm World Steel Dynamics. He added that he believes demand will continue to grow 3% to 5% for the foreseeable future. Ralph Oppenheimer, chairman of Stemcor Holdings Ltd., a steel distributor based in London, disagrees. He says China's steel industry grew too quickly in recent years and is headed toward slower growth.",
        "debiased_text": "U.S. steel imports from emerging markets have increased while demand and prices have declined, leading to reduced production by domestic steelmakers to maintain pricing power. Higher imports benefit U.S. manufacturers using steel in products such as appliances and auto parts, as they face lower material costs. However, North American steelmakers, which experienced price and profit increases last year due to factors like a weak dollar, high freight rates, and strong Chinese demand, face challenges from rising imports. Analysts suggest that anticipated further declines in U.S. steel prices may reduce imports in the coming months. Currently, the U.S. remains a key import market as China increases self-sufficiency and global prices fall. \n\nSteel imports to the U.S. reached 8.87 million tons in the first four months of the year, a 23% increase from the previous year. Significant increases came from Russia, China, and Brazil. The figures include semifinished steel processed in U.S. mills.

The AISI advocates for maintaining import tariffs, subsidies, and raw material export restrictions, while opposing policies it considers unfair. Conversely, the Precision Metalforming Association, representing manufacturers that use steel, supports increased imports of certain steel products and opposes trade protections, citing market distortions caused by import duties. \n\nU.S. steel producers, including U.S. Steel Corp., have reduced output to stabilize prices. Mittal Steel Co. temporarily laid off 700 workers at its Weirton, West Virginia plant, with no plans for permanent closures. Prices for hot-rolled coil steel, which peaked at $722 per ton last September, fell to approximately $560 by May. Analysts note that if U.S. prices remain higher than global levels, imports may continue to rise. \n\nGlobal producers are also adjusting output. Corus Group PLC plans to reduce production by 175,000 tons per month in the third quarter, while ThyssenKrupp AG anticipates soft prices for several months but expects long-term growth in China. Chinese industry officials suggest prices may rebound soon due to sustained demand. Executives like Mittal predict continued global demand growth of 3-5%, driven by China’s industrialization. However, others, such as Ralph Oppenheimer of Stemcor Holdings Ltd., caution that China’s steel industry may face slower growth after rapid expansion."

        "original_text": "It was pure Fawlty Towers. According to Helmut Kohl, Margaret Thatcher's comment after the Berlin Wall came down was: \"We've beaten the Germans twice. Now they're back.\" If true, this seems a rather perverse response, since Thatcher had spent the 1980s supporting Ronald Reagan in the last big battle of the Cold War, one that resulted in an economically weak Soviet Union being bankrupted by its attempts to keep up with the west in an arms race. Thatcher and Reagan hailed the demolition of the Berlin Wall as the release of millions of people from tyranny. Moreover, the idea that a reunited Germany would seek to wind back the clock to pre-war days by annexing parts of Czechoslovakia and Poland (which is what Kohl reports Thatcher as saying in his memoirs) was always ludicrous. It was, after all, Gerhard Schröder's trenchant opposition to militarism that won him, against the odds, the election of 2002. Bellicosity is no more a vote winner in the re-forged Germany than it was in the old West Germany. Thatcher was right, however, in her belief that German reunification would have profound consequences, even though she - along with just about everybody else - failed to see what they would be. For one thing, it helped to neuter the Conservative party as a political fighting force in Britain by setting off a colossal economic boom that was in turn reined in by the anti-inflation hawks at the Bundesbank. German reunification in 1990 coincided almost to the day with Britain's entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism, and membership of the anti-inflationary club proved more and more painful as the Bundesbank ratcheted up interest rates. The denouement came on Black Wednesday in September 1992, when the pound was turfed out of the ERM; the Conservative party has been a broken force ever since. Deep irony Given Thatcher's own ideological bent, the second consequence of German reunification and the collapse of communism was deeply ironic. Both she and Ronald Reagan had spent the 1980s attempting to re-invigorate western capitalism by liberalising markets and making life more difficult for organised labour. Even so, there were limits. One was physical: there were large chunks of the world where capitalism's writ did not run and as a result the direct pressure on wages in the west from low-cost competition in the rest of the world was far less pronounced. A second was political: the existence of the Berlin Wall was a constant reminder that there was an alternative to the west - however economically inefficient and politically odious it might be - and it was therefore important for liberal economic policies to recognise this as a constraint. This meant there were certain no-go areas for policymakers concerned that people in the west would become more sympathetic to left-wing ideas if they were pushed too hard. Thatcher, for example, might have considered the NHS to be a lumbering relic of 1940s collectivism but she was cautious in her attempts to tamper with such a totemic symbol of the post-war social democratic consensus. Both these constraints have now been removed. The past 15 years have seen the market arrive in the countries of the former Eastern bloc, a massive acceleration of liberal economic reforms in China, and India move away from a command economy. Nor is there any longer a need to keep the workers in the west sweet. Capitalism is now the only game in town, and the attitude is that those who don't like it can lump it. When there was a risk, however small, that people in the west might be seduced by communism, social democracy was an insurance policy. Now it is seen as an impediment to the more efficient application of the market. Politics in the west has adjusted to this new reality, with parties of the left far more aggressive in their embrace of the market than Thatcher and Reagan were prepared to go in the 1980s. Tony Blair's argument to Labour MPs unhappy about his reforms of the NHS or of disability benefit is that the world has been changed profoundly by globalisation and there is no point in hankering for the days when the west was insulated from competition. A milder form of social democracy, he would say, is still possible in the west but only if societies embrace change. Yet the ability of politicians in the west to push through reforms is limited by the need to remain in power. There have been plenty of straws in the wind recently that suggest a backlash against globalisation: the result of the German election; the no vote in the French referendum; the retreat of George Bush on social security reform; the Schumer-Graham bill that proposes tariffs on Chinese imports into the US. Attempts are being made in London today to keep global trade liberalisation talks alive with a meeting involving the US, the EU, Brazil and India; the reason progress is proving so slow is that grassroots protectionist sentiment is growing in the west. Stephen King, global head of research at HSBC, has an explanation. \"Globalisation,\" he argues, \"isn't just a story about a rising number of export markets for western producers. Rather, it's a story about massive waves of income distribution, from rich labour to poor labour, from labour as a whole to capital, and from energy users to energy producers. This is a story about winners and losers, not a fable about economic growth.\" Redistribution of income from workers in the west to workers in low-income countries has come about both through capital leaving high-cost sites in north America and western Europe for low-cost greenfield sites in Asia or eastern Europe, and through labour coming in the other direction. The rise in immigration has helped to keep downward pressure on wages in the west. Within western economies, labour's weak bargaining position has meant capital has been able to increase its share of the cake. Lower prices The upside of globalisation is that it has led to lower prices and hence raised real incomes in the west. But King says it is not as simple as workers winning on the roundabouts what they lose on the swings. \"Consumers and workers are not one and the same thing: consumers include children, students, househusbands and wives, pensioners and the unemployed - none of these receives a wage. Equally, consumers include owners of capital - shareholders - and those who receive income from their savings, whether through bank accounts or through ownership of bond portfolios.\" It's not difficult to see why politicians intoning about the challenges of globalisation are met with such cynicism. It's easy to be enthusiastic about globalisation if you are a winner, less easy if you're a loser. If you've just received a 2% pay rise when your chief executive has pocketed an increase 10 times as big; if your job has just been outsourced to India or China, or if your ability to negotiate a pay rise is limited by the arrival of cheap foreign labour, you're not necessarily going to buy the argument that it is illegitimate to defend your job and your living standards. And as King rightly notes, the losers from globalisation all have votes. To coin a phrase: capitalism is creating its own enemy within. larry.elliott@theguardian.com",
        "debiased_text": "According to Helmut Kohl’s memoirs, Margaret Thatcher reportedly commented after the fall of the Berlin Wall: 'We’ve beaten the Germans twice. Now they’re back.' Thatcher and Ronald Reagan had supported policies during the 1980s that contributed to the economic strain on the Soviet Union. Both leaders viewed the demolition of the Berlin Wall as a liberation of millions from authoritarian rule. Kohl’s account also suggested Thatcher expressed concerns about a reunited Germany potentially revisiting pre-war territorial ambitions, though such claims were widely dismissed. German reunification in 1990 coincided with Britain’s entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). High interest rates set by the Bundesbank later contributed to Britain’s exit from the ERM on September 16, 1992, an event known as Black Wednesday. \n\nThe end of the Cold War removed geopolitical constraints on capitalist expansion. Over the past 15 years, former Eastern Bloc nations adopted market-oriented reforms, while China and India moved away from command economies. This shift reduced the leverage of labor in Western economies. Political parties in the West, including traditionally left-leaning ones, have increasingly embraced market-driven policies, with figures such as Tony Blair arguing that globalization necessitates adaptation. \n\nRecent political developments, including election outcomes in Germany and France, as well as legislative efforts like the Schumer-Graham bill in the U.S., indicate growing protectionist sentiments. Trade liberalization discussions involving the U.S., EU, Brazil, and India have faced challenges due to rising protectionism. Stephen King of HSBC has observed that globalization results in significant income redistribution, benefiting capital holders and low-cost labor markets while reducing wage pressure in Western economies. Immigration has also contributed to this trend. \n\nWhile globalization has lowered consumer prices, it has also created economic disparities. Workers facing stagnant wages or job displacement may view protective measures as justified. As King notes, political responses to globalization are influenced by the voting power of those adversely affected."

        "title": "Hiroshima: war's dreadful price",
        "original_text": "The 60th anniversary of the dropping of the first atomic bomb is upon us. The occasion will be marked by a torrent of prose from those who regard the destruction of Hiroshima and of Nagasaki three days later as \"war crimes\", for ever attaching shame to those who ordered them. By contrast, there will be a plethora of dismissive comment from pundits who believe the nuclear assault saved a million allied casualties in 1945, by causing Japan to surrender without an invasion of its mainland. Plentiful evidence is available to both schools. In the spring of 1945 Americans fighting in the Pacific were awed by the suicidal resistance they encountered. Hundreds of Japanese pilots, thousands of soldiers and civilians, immolated themselves, inflicting heavy US losses, rather than accept the logic of surrender. It was well-known that the Japanese forces were preparing a similar sacrificial defence of their homeland. Allied planning for an invasion in the autumn of 1945 assumed hundreds of thousands of casualties. Allied soldiers - and prisoners - in east Asia were profoundly grateful when the atomic bombs, in their eyes, saved their lives. On the other side of the argument is the fact that in the summer of 1945 Japan's economy was collapsing. The US submarine blockade had strangled oil and raw-materials supply lines. Air attack had destroyed many factories and 60% of civilian housing. Some authoritative Washington analysts asserted that Japan's morale was cracking. Intercepts of Japanese diplomatic cables revealed to Washington that Tokyo was soliciting Stalin's good offices to end the war. The Americans were also aware of the Soviets' imminent intention to invade Japanese-occupied China in overwhelming strength. In short, current evidence demonstrates that Japan had no chance of sustaining effective resistance. If America's fleets had merely lingered offshore until the autumn of 1945, they could have watched the Japanese people, already desperately hungry, starve to death or perish beneath conventional bombing. Oddly enough, Soviet entry into the war on August 8 was more influential than the atomic explosions in convincing Japanese leaders that they must quit. In some eyes, this adds up to a devastating indictment against President Harry Truman, who launched the most murderous weapon in history against a nation already doomed. How is it possible, in the light of such facts, for students like me to retain sympathy - enthusiasm is impossible - for Truman's decision? The foremost answer is that much we now know was then uncertain. Amid their defeats in 1941-42, the allies had developed an exaggerated respect for their enemy's might. They did not comprehend in 1945 how close was Japan's industrial collapse. Second, although Tokyo plainly wanted to escape from the war, its terms remained confused. There is little doubt that, if Washington had explicitly promised that the emperor might retain his throne, Japan would have bowed. But so faltering and divided was Japan's leadership that the US still possessed grounds for real doubt about Tokyo's intentions. And why should Washington offer guarantees for Emperor Hirohito's future when he had been at least the figurehead for Japan's terrible deeds? Many Japanese generals bitterly opposed surrender, even after the Soviet invasion, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was not that they deluded themselves that they could win. Rather, they preferred death to humiliation. All wars brutalise all participants, but both sides in the Pacific had become exceptionally desensitised. The great war correspondent Ernie Pyle wrote shortly before his own death in combat: \"In Europe we felt that our enemies, horrible and deadly as they were, were still people. But out here I soon gathered that the Japanese were looked upon as something subhuman and repulsive, the way people feel about cockroaches and mice.\" Japan's occupation of China had cost 15 million Chinese lives. Civilians had been raped, tortured, enslaved and massacred, while British and US prisoners were subjected to hideous maltreatment. The Japanese had been waging biological warfare in China. Their notorious Unit 731 subjected hundreds of prisoners to vivisection. Many captured American airmen were beheaded. Some were eaten. A B-29 crew was dissected alive at a Japanese city hospital. Americans, in their turn, showed themselves reluctant to take prisoners. They subjected Japan's cities to the vast fire-bombing raids that began in March 1945, killing half a million people. Lawrence Freedman and Saki Dockrill, in a powerful analysis, argue that the nuclear assault must be perceived in the context of the deadly incendiary raids that preceded it: \"Nobody involved in the decision on the atomic bombs could have seen themselves as setting new precedents for mass destruction in scale - only in efficiency.\" More people - 100,000 - died in the March 9 Tokyo incendiary attack than at Hiroshima. Amid a conflict in which 50 million people had already died, those who dispatched the Enola Gay viewed the judgment with gravity, but without the sense of uniqueness that posterity perceives as appropriate. Uncertainty persisted in August 1945 about whether the bombs would work. This was one reason for Washington's reluctance to stage an offshore demonstration, though more potent was a desire to administer to the enemy a more devastating shock. The decision-makers were men who had grown accustomed to the necessity for cruel judgments. There was overwhelming technological momentum: a titanic effort had been made to create a weapon for which the allies saw themselves as competing with their foes. After Hiroshima, General Leslie Groves, the chief of the Manhattan Project, was almost the only man to succumb to triumphalism. He said: \"We have spent $2bn on the greatest scientific gamble in history - we won.\" Having devoted such resources to the bomb, an extraordinary initiative would have been needed from Truman to arrest its employment. Those who today find it easy to condemn the architects of Hiroshima sometimes seem to lack humility in recognising the frailties of the decision-makers, mortal men grappling with dilemmas of a magnitude our own generation has been spared. In August 1945, amid a world sick of death in the cause of defeating evil, allied lives seemed very precious, while the enemy appeared to value neither his own nor those of the innocent. Truman's Hiroshima judgment may seem wrong in the eyes of posterity, but it is easy to understand why it seemed right to most of his contemporaries.",
        "debiased_text": "The 60th anniversary of the first atomic bomb's use has been reached. This event will be noted by discussions from those who view the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as controversial actions, as well as by those who argue the bombings hastened Japan's surrender and prevented further Allied casualties. Evidence exists supporting both perspectives. In early 1945, Allied forces in the Pacific encountered significant resistance from Japanese troops, including instances of self-sacrifice. Plans for a potential invasion of Japan projected high casualty numbers. Conversely, by mid-1945, Japan's economy was faltering due to blockades and air attacks. Diplomatic communications indicated Japan sought mediation to end the war. The Soviet Union's impending entry into the conflict also influenced Japan's position. Debate continues over whether Japan's surrender was inevitable without atomic attacks. Historians note uncertainty at the time regarding Japan's intentions and capabilities. Some Japanese leaders opposed surrender even after the bombings and Soviet intervention. The war in the Pacific involved extreme actions by both sides, including firebombing campaigns and treatment of prisoners. The decision to use atomic weapons occurred amidst broader strategic considerations and technological developments during wartime."

        "title": "Jonathan Watts returns to Tokyo to find out original Asian tiger, Japan, stirring",
        "original_text": "When I left Japan in 2003, things were looking terminally gloomy. For most of the previous seven years reporting from Tokyo, I had written an unrelenting stream of miserable stories about salarymen suicides, zombie companies and a corrupt one-party political system dying slowly from sclerosis. Throw in the ageing population, staggering debt and declining regional influence and it looked as if this was a country sinking slowly, but gracefully, into decline. But over recent weeks, there have been stirrings, and then rumblings, of a comeback. The hangover from the \"bubble economy\" of the 80s, and the Asian financial crisis that followed - the so-called lost decade, which actually lasted 15 years - is said, at long, long last, to be over. And, although there have been several false dawns in the past, there is compelling evidence to suggest that this time the recovery is for real. Japan's economy is growing. Share values have doubled from their lowest point. Employment is up, debt is down and bankruptcies are at their lowest level since 1989. Even land prices, which have fallen for 15 years in a row, appear to have hit bottom. In a few prime areas of Tokyo, some plots are actually worth more today than they were yesterday. Exports are booming. Shoppers are opening their wallets again. Even deflation - that strange scourge of the Japanese economic system - may soon be at an end. The central bank recently made the bold prediction that the consumer price index might rise as high as zero by the end of the year. In January, it is forecast to enter positive territory for the first time in seven years. After a surge in speculation on the stock markets, some are already having flashbacks to the late 80s. When I flew back into Tokyo early last week the first headline I saw, in the Evening Fuji tabloid, was \"The Bubble is Back\". Whatever happened to the suicidal, bankrupt, tortured - but actually rather comfortable - Japan I had grown to know and love? For most of the past 20 years, views of Japan have swung between two poles: it is either said to be so strong that it is going to take over the world, or so weak (\"the sick man of Asia\", according to former prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone) that it will bring the global financial system crashing down. But what about now? Does this nascent recovery mark the start of another giddy extreme? Is big wild money back? Or are we in for something cooler, safer, steadier? I begin my quest for answers in Ginza, the area of Tokyo that became notorious in the late 80s as the world's most expensive place to party. It is an exclusive and almost uniquely Japanese world, but a friend puts me in touch with one of its leading figures: Natsumi Nakajima, mama-san (owner) of one of Tokyo's most prestigious hostess bars, Club Socie. \"It is always crowded here, but not like the bubble era,\" she says. \"In those days, there were queues of people outside the big bars every night. If someone spent a million yen (£5,000) in one night, no one raised an eyebrow. There was one guy who used to wander around Ginza with a suitcase full of cash - at least 10m yen - going from club to club until it was all gone on tips and drinks. Another took me and every hostess in the club to Hawaii.\" In those days, the big spenders were mostly real-estate agents, construction bosses and financial brokers, and the money they blew was their own. They disappeared during the lost decade, says Nakajima, but in their place came executives and public officials who paid their way out of corporate and tax budgets. More recently, customers tend to be IT entrepreneurs and individual investors, and they are once again using their own money. (Nakajima's analysis fits almost perfectly with the trends in the macroeconomy in the past 15 years. The bubble was fuelled by speculation. Once it burst, the economy relied on exports and government spending. And now, domestic consumer demand is slowly picking up again.) During the darkest days of the lost decade, many Ginza clubs went bankrupt and their hostesses - used to earning £60,000 a year for massaging nothing more than egos - went into prostitution. The biggest sign that the recovery is genuine, says Nakajima, is that this trend has stopped. \"Now, I'd say business is not as big as during the bubble, but it is healthier. People may spend less, but they always pay now.\" Talking of paying, it shortly becomes clear to me that Ginza's notoriously outrageous prices have not budged much since the bubble. Our interview finished, Nakajima presents me with the bill: 52,000 yen (£260) for one beer - one small, very ordinary beer - and an hour's chit-chat. I am too shocked to say anything. Seeing my surprise, the friend who introduced us cuts in: \"It is cheap because you are here for work, not fun. They have charged you the minimum.\" I swallow hard and pay up. Prices in Ginza may still be high, but because everything is always compared with life during the bubble, many people in Japan - still 20 times richer than China - feel their country has become a model of prudence. \"We don't waste money like we used to,\" says Kenji Ohashi, my taxi driver the next day. \"All the older guys in my company complain that things are not like they were during the bubble. Then, everyone used taxis because their companies picked up the tab. Now people are more cautious because it is their money. And the competition is tougher because there are more cars on the road. But things are better than they were five years ago.\" We are on our way to Roppongi Hills, the sleek new mega-development at the centre of Japan's comeback. Conceived in the bubble, but left dormant for most of the lost decade, this vast $2.2bn office, residential and cultural complex was once seen as a white elephant that threatened to trample Japan's fragile economy. Before it opened in 2003, many analysts predicted that it would flood Tokyo with office space, pushing down prices and forcing rivals out of business. Instead, it has coincided with a resurgence of the city's commercial property market, and as confidence has gone up, vacancy rates have gone down - from 9% in 2003 to 4% this year. Japan's new economy has gravitated to Roppongi Hills. The 51-storey main tower is now the headquarters of the country's fastest growing and most aggressive internet and investment firms: Yahoo, Rakuten, Livedoor and Murakami Fund. These firms have been causing waves by trying to buy up the nation's baseball teams and TV companies - the face and voice of \"old Japan\". The adjacent residential blocks - designed by Terence Conran - are now home to the country's most talked-about businessmen, and they pay millions of yen a month in rent. Between Roppongi's business and residential areas lies Keiyakizaka Street. Until two years ago, no one had heard of it, but it's now a contender for the title of the world's most upmarket shopping arcade. The pavements are full of beautiful young men and women with pedigree spaniels and chihuahuas; they shop here for Versace dresses, Harrods menswear, La Perla underwear and Emma Hope shoes. At the height of the bubble, the Japanese art world spent its time loudly snapping up overpriced Van Goghs and Monets (which were then quietly sold off during the lost decade). But in the main tower of Roppongi Hills, the Mori art museum provides clues as to how the cultural scene has shifted since then. The museum is showing an anything but traditional exhibition by Hiroshi Sugimoto, which mixes photographs of museum displays with theatre and architecture. \"The bursting of the bubble was the best thing that happened to contemporary art in Japan,\" says the director, David Elliott, who is English - the first non-Japanese director of an art museum in Japan. \"It got rid of a lot of nonsense and arrogance. And it brought in a new generation of artists and a new language that was more critical. The market for contemporary Japanese art used to be outside the country, but now it is becoming stronger domestically. There is a new generation of collectors.\" If Roppongi Hills is any guide, Japan is definitely back. But it has changed. This Japan is more globalised than traditional. Apart from the kanji signs and the rice paddy on top of one of the buildings, Roppongi Hills could be anywhere in the world. \"We are praised as a symbol of economic recovery, but we are also criticised for not being Japanese enough,\" says Michiko Kishi, public relations manager of the Roppongi Hills developer, Mori Building. \"We are a base for change. Tokyo needed something new or it would have lost its status as an Asian business centre. We would have been overwhelmed by Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Seoul.\" Japan's recovery has been heavily influenced by its changing relationship with the outside world. Politically, it has drawn closer to America, even offering troops for peacekeeping missions. This was unthinkable in 1989, but it is crucial now to ensure supplies of oil. When George Bush arrives in Tokyo tomorrow, there is no doubt that he will be visiting America's staunchest ally in Asia. Economically, Japan is increasingly intertwined with China. Mori Building is a pioneer in this respect. The company's biggest new overseas investment is in Shanghai, where it is funding the construction of what will be the planet's tallest building. Once completed in 2008, the World Financial Centre will stretch half a kilometre into the sky. Mori Building is by no means alone. Many Japanese companies are moving into China to build manufacturing plants or to exploit the world's fastest-growing market. Despite the rising political tensions between these two powers, there would have been no comeback by Japan - and far less growth in China - if they had stopped trading. Tokyo's exports to Beijing have surged to 8 trillion yen in the past few years and now account for 13% of all overseas shipments. \"China is a very important factor in Japan's recovery and is becoming more so,\" says Kiichi Murashima, an economist at Nikko Citigroup. But there are other reasons why the situation has improved. \"The excess debt, excess capacity and excess labour that built up during the bubble era have largely been removed. At the minimum, Japan's economy has more staying power than it had during the lost decade. It is now more resilient to external shocks.\" There are signs, albeit small ones, that irrational exuberance might once again be inflating asset values. On the Tokyo stock exchange, trading volumes are now higher than they were during the bubble period. The aggregate market value of shares has bounced back to 80% of its peak. And in many cases, it is hard to see why. Earnings per share are still far lower than in Europe or the US. The main corporate beneficiaries of the surge in equity values have not been global players - such as Toyota, Canon and Matsushita - who have restructured. Instead, it is regional banks, insurance companies, steelmakers and construction firms, many of which have changed little since they were written off as \"zombies\" five years ago. \"This is not a real recovery. It's just wish fulfilment,\" says a foreign hedge-fund manager who asks to remain nameless. \"The zombies have come back. There's a new bubble in the domestic stock market.\" A raft of veteran Japan watchers, such as Bill Emott and Jesper Koll, say this is nonsense. They argue that the economy has genuinely become leaner and more competitive. In the political heartland of Kasumigaseki, it is not hard to find supporters of this rosy view - even among MPs who were formerly outspoken critics of a system that has been dominated by one party, the Liberal Democrats, for 50 years. \"The lost decade is definitely over now. We've had a few fake comebacks before, but this one is for real. Japan is recovering,\" says Taro Kono, the new vice minister for justice. \"We have changed. The old systems have been torn down. In the economy, banks and businesses talk of profits now instead of size. In politics, the factions are no longer important. Our party actually represents the people. Japan is becoming a real parliamentary democracy.\" Not surprisingly, Kono credits his boss - the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi - for restoring national confidence. Arguably the most dramatic sign of change came in September when the premier called a snap election, recruited a team of \"assassins\" to stand against opponents in his own party, and won a landslide victory on a campaign to reform the post office. This brilliant piece of political theatre, unimaginable five years ago, has convinced the public that the country at last has a strong leader. Koizumi has been fiercely criticised, particularly in China and Korea, for visiting the controversial Yasukuni shrine, which honours, among Japan's many war dead, a number of war criminals. But in this too, he has correctly read the mood of a country that is growing more nationalistic even as it becomes more globalised. It is an insecure, inward-looking reaction; a sign that today's Japan is less sure of itself than 15 years ago. Then Tokyo was the world's biggest aid donor and the unrivalled power in Asia. Now it is cutting back on its largesse every year and arrogance is impossible. Never has Japan been more politically dependent on the US and more economically reliant on China. \"Japan is regaining its confidence, but it is not yet back to the levels of 1989,\" says Kono. \"At that time we almost conquered the world economy, but now, because of China's rise, we cannot even dominate the region. Even though business is improving, the big new firms are domestic-orientated. We don't have any rising new corporate stars that look likely to become global champions as was the case 15 years ago.\" At least one of those old sluggers is still on top form. Toyota has gone from strength to strength over the past 15 years by ignoring almost all the conventional wisdom of the 90s. While other firms restructured, it expanded. Instead of shifting production to China, it ramped up capacity in Japan. Rather than merging with foreign firms and calling for advice from overseas managers, it stuck closely to its own way of doing things. The result is that it exported a record 2m cars in 2004. And within three years, it is expected to overtake General Motors as the world's biggest auto manufacturer. If any place in Japan is enjoying a boom, it is Toyota city, near Nagoya. But elsewhere, the picture is mixed. During the bubble, everyone was racking up profits. But today the gap between the winners and the losers is growing. Toyota is doing well, Sony is suffering. Tokyo is prospering, Osaka is still in the doldrums. There are new millionaires working in Roppongi Hills. There are also new homeless people sleeping in Shinjuku Park. As I head back to my home in Beijing, I wonder whether I have found a richer Japan simply because I have been - for the first time - looking for one. But then, perceptions help to shape economies and almost everyone I have met on this trip agrees that the lost decade is really over. But they also agree that the peaks of 1989 cannot return. Japan may be back, but it is a more timid, more realistic creature. Its new economy is modest, mixed, a little confused. If anything has changed in the past 15 years, it may well be that Japan has finally become - in the words of one of the most influential politicians of this period, Ichiro Ozawa - an \"ordinary country\". Japan no longer makes for great headlines about miracle growth and terrifying risk; those dubious accolades now go to China. But perhaps Tokyo should not worry too much. It appears to be prospering rather well out of the limelight. 'The lost decade is definitely over now. We have had a few fake comebacks before, but this one is for real. Japan is recovering'",
        "debiased_text": "In 2003, Japan faced economic challenges including corporate struggles, political stagnation, an aging population, high debt, and declining regional influence. Recently, indicators suggest potential economic recovery. Japan's GDP is rising, stock values have doubled from their lowest point, employment has increased, debt has decreased, and bankruptcies are at their lowest level since 1989. Land prices, which declined for 15 consecutive years, appear to have stabilized, with some prime Tokyo areas seeing slight increases. Exports have grown, consumer spending has picked up, and deflation may be ending, with predictions of a slight rise in the consumer price index. The Bank of Japan forecasts it may enter positive territory for the first time in seven years by early next year. Some market analysts observe stock speculation reminiscent of the late 1980s bubble economy. Business activity in Tokyo’s Ginza district shows changes since the bubble era, with spending patterns shifting from corporate budgets to individual investors. Roppongi Hills, a major commercial and residential development, has become a hub for Japan’s growing internet and investment firms, with falling vacancy rates indicating renewed commercial real estate demand. Japan’s economic recovery is influenced by closer ties with the U.S. and increased trade with China. Exports to China have risen significantly, now accounting for 13% of Japan’s total overseas shipments. Corporate restructuring has reduced excess debt and labor, strengthening economic resilience. However, some analysts question whether recent stock market gains reflect underlying economic improvement, noting that regional banks and construction firms—previously struggling—are among the beneficiaries. Politically, Japan has seen shifts under Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, including postal reform and a stronger U.S. alliance. Nationalism has also grown, alongside economic globalization. While Tokyo prospers, regional disparities remain, with cities like Osaka lagging. Major corporations like Toyota thrive, while others, such as Sony, face challenges. Analysts debate whether Japan’s recovery marks a sustainable shift or a temporary upturn. While economic conditions have improved since the 1990s, few predict a return to the peak levels of the late 1980s. Japan’s economy is now more diversified and globally integrated, with a focus on stability over rapid growth."

        "title": "Music man's battle against the pirates",
        "original_text": "The title of Coldplay's recent comeback single, Speed of Sound, was rather apt. But EMI chairman Eric Nicoli doesn't need reminding how quickly things change in the music industry. In a world where an act can go from being everyone's darlings to yesterday's men in the space of six months, the corporate ride can be something of a rollercoaster too. In February, EMI's share price dived after eagerly awaited albums by Coldplay and Gorillaz were delayed. To make matters worse Coldplay's Chris Martin helpfully said in April that he didn't care about the company, adding that \"shareholders are the greatest evil of the modern world\" and analysts started to talk again about a potential merger with Warner Music. But with the albums in question now riding high around the world - Coldplay's X&amp;Y having topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic and in 26 other countries - and the share price in better shape, Mr Nicoli can afford to focus on the wider structural issues facing the music industry. In particular, the recent US supreme court ruling that found peer-to-peer file-sharing company Grokster liable for encouraging its users to swap pirated tracks over the internet which marked an important staging post in the industry's battle with digital piracy. Having seen global sales collapse by 25% over the past six years, Mr Nicoli is confident that a corner has been turned. \"The reason we are delighted with the Grokster decision is that it shows that in the world's biggest music market, the courts take a dim view of people who encourage or facilitate and turn a blind eye to online theft as a mechanism for promoting their own business,\" he says. Just as importantly, he believes the industry is beginning to win the PR war to convince consumers that downloading tracks for nothing is \"theft\". The carrot-and-stick approach of licensing more content to legal providers such as Apple's iTunes and Napster while pursuing individuals who have made pirated tracks available over the internet is beginning to bear fruit for the beleaguered industry. \"We're certainly making good progress. We're encouraged that more and more people understand why stealing is a bad thing. Our job is to make it more difficult as well as more dangerous to steal it. But more importantly, to make it easier and more convenient to buy,\" he says, pointing out that digital sales will account for 5% of the total this year. \"We want to allow people to access music however they want, whenever they want - as long as they pay for it. And if they don't want to pay for it, we'll be on to them. I think that's fair,\" says Mr Nicoli, delivering a well practised line and pointing to the untapped potential for legitimate digital sales, particularly in the relatively new mobile market and among older consumers who \"rarely visit a record shop\". However, he does admit that the industry as a whole was too slow off the mark when digital piracy first emerged as a real threat with the genesis of the first incarnation of Napster in 1999 and the subsequent development of more sophisticated peer-to-peer file sharing services such as Kazaa and Grokster. \"Clearly, with hindsight, we could and should have been faster,\" he says. It wasn't until the launch of Apple's iTunes two years ago that a truly attractive legal alternative was available. Mr Nicoli points the finger of blame at EMI's major label rivals: \"It's really only in the last couple of years that everyone came on board. Some of the majors were owned by international conglomerates who aspired to be the gatekeeper. \"Early on there was a reluctance on the part of those companies to cooperate with everyone else. Because of some personnel changes and because of the crisis that the industry faced a couple of years ago, everyone has come on board. Now we're starting to see dramatic growth of digital distribution - and not just downloads but subscriptions, legalised peer-to-peer and all the mobile applications.\" He accepts the historical argument that because so many tracks were unavailable online, the only way to get hold of them was to download them illegally, hastily adding that it is no longer valid. But he rebuffs the long-held argument that fewer people would download pirated tracks if CDs and downloads were cheaper. \"That's bollocks. Are they saying that if CDs were half the price they wouldn't steal it? You can't compete with free,\" he retorts. Another oft-heard argument is that by locking artists into binding contracts, record companies tend to inhibit creativity and that a freer approach to copyright would lead to better music and a closer relationship between artists and fans. Unsurprisingly it is one with which Nicoli, who has been at the helm of EMI for six bumpy years, has no truck. \"I don't buy the argument that if there was a complete free for all there would be more creativity. The reason it's lost steam was because it was crap. If artists can't find a way of getting rewarded for the creation of their content they won't make a career of it,\" he says. Piracy is just one issue that Mr Nicoli, who is also chairman of the UK Music Forum, believes could be raised by a new music council quango recently suggested by creative industries minister James Purnell. \"The fact that music has been raised in the minds of government in recent months is a very good thing,\" he says. Envisaged as a lobbying body along the lines of the Film Council, Mr Nicoli believes that the traditionally divergent aims of the industry need a powerful voice to lobby on issues such as piracy and its campaign to increase the length of copyright beyond 50 years. \"It's a good idea for the industry to have a single, credible, powerful voice. We lobby by making credible arguments and explaining ourselves well and better than we have in the past,\" says Mr Nicoli. He is also keen, he says, to make the case for tax rebates on A&amp;R. In the meantime, Mr Nicoli insists that sales trends are looking brighter than they have for several years. And with Coldplay, Robbie Williams, a reformed Pink Floyd and Joss Stone among the EMI acts to have graced the Live 8 stage in Hyde Park on Saturday, he points to the depth of the company's roster as another reason to be cheerful. Emerging markets such as China and India, up to now completely lost to physical piracy, are also showing signs of developing legitimate markets and are \"very encouraging in the long-term,\" he says. \"In every single market in the world, we're seeing the physical market trends flattening out and at the same time we're seeing the digital market grow dramatically. We feel from now on that the growth in digital will outstrip the decline in physical.\" But while the Grokster judgment is an important one for the record industry, it leaves several grey areas. First, it suggests that software companies are only liable if they promote the use of peer-to-peer networks to share pirated material. Then there is the danger, common to all internet crime, that the worst offenders will simply move offshore. \"What the supreme court did was make a ruling that effectively gives the content owners authority to sue. Now it goes back to the local courts,\" he says, bullishly. \"It gives us encouragement and will get the attention of policymakers everywhere else in the world. We'll keep fighting the battles. If they crop up elsewhere, we'll go after them elsewhere. Where ever they are we'll pursue them.\"",
        "debiased_text": "EMI chairman Eric Nicoli discussed recent developments in the music industry, including the performance of EMI artists and legal rulings on digital piracy. In February, EMI's share price declined after album releases by Coldplay and Gorillaz were delayed. Coldplay's Chris Martin later commented in April that he did not prioritize the company, calling shareholders 'the greatest evil of the modern world.' Analysts at the time speculated about a potential merger between EMI and Warner Music. However, Coldplay's album 'X&Y' later reached the top of charts in multiple regions, including the U.S., UK, and 26 other countries, contributing to an improved share price for EMI. Nicoli addressed broader industry challenges, including digital piracy. The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled that peer-to-peer file-sharing service Grokster could be held liable for encouraging users to exchange pirated tracks online. Nicoli stated this ruling was significant for the industry, which has seen a 25% decline in global sales over the past six years. He noted efforts to combat piracy through legal actions against individuals distributing unauthorized content while expanding licensed distribution through services like iTunes and Napster. Digital sales now account for 5% of total industry revenue. Nicoli acknowledged that the industry initially responded slowly to digital piracy, which emerged as a major issue with the rise of Napster in 1999, followed by services like Kazaa and Grokster. He attributed part of the delay to hesitation among major record labels, but stated that collaboration has since improved. Nicoli dismissed arguments that lower prices for CDs and downloads would reduce piracy, stating it was unrealistic to compete with free content. He also rejected claims that restrictive artist contracts stifle creativity, asserting that fair compensation is necessary for artists to sustain careers. The UK government has proposed a new music council to address industry issues such as piracy and copyright extension. Nicoli supported the idea, emphasizing the need for unified industry representation. Regarding market trends, he noted growth in digital sales and emerging markets like China and India, where legitimate music markets are developing. However, challenges remain, including the possibility that file-sharing operations may relocate to avoid legal consequences following the Grokster ruling. Nicoli stated that EMI would continue pursuing legal action where necessary."

Mure Dickie reports: [ASIA EDITION]; Crackdown could tarnish Beijing's shiny image: Tighter media control and the detaining of journalists show China in an unfavourable light. Mure Dickie reports:   [ASIA EDITION ]",
        "original_text": "On the surface, Beijinghas changed completely since soldiers of the People's Liberation Army used guns and tanks to drive pro- democracy protesters from its streets 16 years ago today. Olympian plans for the 2008 Games, soaring skyscrapers, and five- star hotels full of eager international business people have helped to transform the Chinese capital's international reputation since the crushing of the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989. But by detaining staff of foreign news organisations and tightening controls on domestic media, China's leaders have underlined the political continuities that lie behind Beijing's tumultuous social and economic change. In doing so, they risk tarnishing China's global image and offering ammunition to claims that far from embracing more liberal policies, Communist party leaders are growing more hostile to any challenge to their grip on power. This week, Beijing accused Ching Cheong, a Hong Kong-based correspondent for the Singapore Straits Times, of spying after holding him in detention for more than a month. Chinese authorities also charged New York Times researcher Zhao Yan - in custody since last year - with fraud. Law Yuk-kai, director of Hong Kong's Human Rights Monitor, says the two-year-old administration of Hu Jintao, China's president, and Premier Wen Jiabao has been cracking down on domestic news organisations that had been enjoying increasing freedom. \"Beijing's attitude toward the media has tightened since Hu and Wen took over,\" Mr Law says. \"Which country has the highest number of journalists in jail? China.\" At least 42 reporters were known to be behind bars in China at the end of last year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a US- based media watchdog. While journalists have been jailed for a range of offences, many analysts say that charges of leaking state secrets, corruption or financial misconduct are often merely a cover for the silencing of those whose writings threaten official interests. The International Federation of Journalists said this week that the action against Mr Ching and Mr Zhao marked an expansion of China's policy of media control that could have a \"chilling effect\" on foreign news operations in the country. \"While it is common for the Chinese government to jail Chinese journalists, in the past the government has refrained from jailing foreign journalists and those employed by foreign news agencies,\" it said. Beijing rejects charges that it is targeting reporters, saying journalistic status should not protect people who break China's law. But officials have also made clear their determination to retain their monopoly on political discourse despite a broad commercialisation of the newspaper and broadcasting industries that has given China its most vibrant media since the 1949 communist revolution. Government censors comb through publications and internet sites for content seen as ideologically suspect and often put pressure on authors or editors seen to push political boundaries. An apparent intensification of such efforts has prompted disillusion among overseas observers who had hoped that Mr Hu, who was associated with some would-be political reformers before he became president, might bring a more liberal line to China's government. Mr Hu, who led a harsh crackdown against dissent in Tibet when he served there in the 1980s, was always an unlikely liberal, but some Chinese analysts say his tough approach to the media dose not mean he will not eventually relax controls. \"Right now, stability is the most important thing,\" says a former senior government official, who says that Mr Hu must still contend with the influence of Jiang Zemin, his predecessor as president. \"He has to be cautious.\" Some Chinese observers say moves such as closer monitoring of internet sites may have been prompted in part by raised tensions around the anniversary of the June 4 1989 crackdown. There are also suggestions that Mr Ching was detained after trying to get hold of accounts of interviews with Zhao Ziyang, a former Communist party chief who was deposed for refusing to back the use of force against students 16 years ago. But any post-anniversary relaxation is likely to be limited. Even the former senior official, who believes Mr Hu would like to ease media controls, is not expecting anything bold anytime soon. \"It could take five years,\" he says.

In ajoint communique issued with visiting Taiwanese opposition leader, James Soong, Mr Hu spelled out with unprecedented clarity the content of a \"consensus\" between Beijing and Taipei that led to negotiations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in 1992. The move was a pointed rejoinder to Mr Chen, who has denied the existence of a \"1992 consensus\", saying that talks in the 1990s were possible basically because the two sides agreed to differ on issues of sovereignty. Beijing says Mr Chen must accept the \"1992 consensus\", which, it says, embodies the principle that Taiwan is part of \"One China\", before cross- strait talks can be resumed. In a televised interview late last night, Mr Chen said the communique proved that agreeing to the consensus would define Taiwan as part of China and deprive its people of the right to decide their own future. \"China has not made any concessions. The problem has not been solved,\" Mr Chen said.

        "original_text": "China today is the world's largest start-up and the world's largest turnaround. It draws on a 2,000-year tradition, yet it is inhaling Western business know-how and technology, doing everything at the same time and for the first time. In terms of comparable changes in U.S. history, China is undergoing, simultaneously, the raw capitalism of the robber barons of the late 1800s; the speculative financial mania of the 1920s; the rural-to- urban migration of the 1930s; the emergence of the first-car, first- home, first-college-education, first-family-vacation, middle-class consumer of the 1950s; and even aspects of social upheaval similar to the 1960s. Like all start-ups, the Chinese have progressed through frantic trial and error, making it up every day, copying and modifying practices and products of others, always sprinting to capture the market first, always aiming at the next pile of quick profits. The turnaround side is the Communist Party's decision 26 years ago to unleash the entrepreneurial power of the people, so long smothered and entrapped in the cruel inefficiency of dogma. Western businesses are tantalized by China's huge market, but they need to be wary. That is the central message of \"One Billion Customers: Lessons from the Front Lines of Doing Business in China,\" by James McGregor, The Wall Street Journal's former China bureau chief. In this adaptation, Mr. McGregor recounts how News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch tried to worm his way into favor with China's Communist Party. He made a humiliating trudge to absolution through the lengthy corridors of China's Great Hall of the People, but only after the Chinese discovered that, for all their apparent differences, tycoons are tycoons. --- RUPERT MURDOCH isn't accustomed to cooling his heels. But here he was on a crisp day in October, 1997, pacing back and forth at the top of the steps at the north entrance to the vast Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square, looking skinny, nervous and unimportant. He was anxiously awaiting permission to walk the last mile of his torturous journey into the good graces of the Chinese Communist Party. He was about to be escorted to a meeting with Communist Party propaganda czar Ding Guangen, who had derailed Mr. Murdoch's effort to break into the China media market. Mr. Murdoch had earned the enmity of China's top leadership four years earlier when, in a speech delivered in London, he said that advances in communications technology had \"proved an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere.\" Mr. Murdoch was talking about Russia, but the Chinese took his warning as a dire threat. The speech came just two months after Mr. Murdoch bought control of Hong Kong's Star TV, a satellite-television network that reached every corner of China. A month after Mr. Murdoch's speech, Mr. Ding struck back: Private ownership of satellite dishes was suddenly banned in China. Ever since, Mr. Murdoch had tried to make amends with the party leaders. Expensive consultants got him nowhere. Money donations to a foundation headed by Deng Xiaoping's handicapped son and a lucrative book contract for one of Deng's daughters failed to open doors. He even ordered his executives to remove British Broadcasting Corp. programming from the Star TV transponder that covered China, signaling that he was interested in entertainment, not news, for China. Now, four years after the ban, Chinese President Jiang Zemin was about to visit the U.S., and Mr. Ding wanted to ensure that Mr. Murdoch's Fox network and his U.S. publications would treat Mr. Jiang kindly. Today, Mr. Murdoch would be granted absolution for his speech four years earlier. But first he had to be reminded of his status in China, hence the chilly wait at the north entrance. Even after his escort took Mr. Murdoch and his executives into the Great Hall, they endured an interminable and humbling trek through a maze of red-carpeted hallways to the opposite end of the sprawling complex. As they walked, Mr. Murdoch rehearsed his presentation. There had been misunderstandings, but we shouldn't dwell on the past. We are very influential and want to be the Chinese government's friend. We want to make money in China, not trouble. On they trudged, past ornate meeting halls, up stairs and down, past the cavernous Chinese parliament meeting hall and the 5,000-seat banquet hall. Finally they entered the meeting room where Mr. Ding and China's senior media mavens sat in overstuffed chairs. Mr. Murdoch settled into the chair next to Mr. Ding while his lieutenants filled the other seats. \"I understand you are an Australian company,\" Mr. Ding said to Mr. Murdoch. \"Tell me what you do.\" The polite put-down didn't faze Mr. Murdoch. He said he understood that China has strict rules and regulations for the media and that he would follow them completely. He suggested that he and Chinese government media outlets should work together on noncontroversial projects to build mutual trust. When Mr. Murdoch began reeling off the varied holdings of his News Corp., Mr. Ding interrupted when he heard the word \"Fox.\" \"Fox, Fox movie studios,\" Mr. Ding said. \"I used to love watching Tyrone Power movies when I was a university student.\" The incongruity prompted Mr. Ding to turn to Mr. Murdoch's absolution. Pointing to the officials assembled on his left, Mr. Ding said \"I understand that you have been talking to my people, and it would be a good idea for us to make a fresh start. For the future, here are the people who manage the media businesses in China. All your future dealings should be through them.\" Mr. Murdoch was off the blacklist. It was a much shorter walk on the way out. WHEN CHINESE leaders first shut him out, Mr. Murdoch began meeting with Chinese entrepreneurs. The more he visited China, the more he admired and enjoyed the people. The Chinese were like him, aggressive risk takers, practical people focused on making money, willing to adhere to whatever political line was necessary to do it. As Mr. Murdoch's attitude toward the Chinese changed, so did their attitude toward Mr. Murdoch. After the London speech scare, the Chinese government accumulated a massive file on Mr. Murdoch, convinced he was going to spend his way into China, perhaps at the behest of the Central Intelligence Agency. But the more the Chinese learned about Mr. Murdoch, the more they admired him. He was a carbon copy of the typical Chinese tycoon! The indecipherable labyrinthine structure of his global holdings was standard operating procedure for Chinese tycoons, as was the management structure of News Corp. When asked to draw a management chart of News Corp., one of Mr. Murdoch's executives drew a large circle with a small circle in the middle. \"That's Rupert in the middle,\" the executive said, \"and all along the outer circle are the people who run the various businesses. Mr. Murdoch controls everything personally.\" With Mr. Murdoch's children serving as key executives, the Chinese tycoon model was complete. Finally, Mr. Murdoch was relentless, a quality the Chinese respect. Mr. Ding had ordered officials to keep Mr. Murdoch busy with low-level meetings and to prevent him from talking directly to senior leaders. But Mr. Murdoch used Australian diplomats to arrange a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji in July 1997. During the meeting, Mr. Zhu momentarily confounded Mr. Murdoch. \"I see you became an American citizen so you could operate a television network in the United States,\" Mr. Zhu said. \"Would you be willing to become a Chinese citizen to get into the television business in China?\" Mr. Murdoch grimaced. But then he joined in the gales of laughter that accompanied Mr. Zhu's little joke. China could be comfortable with Mr. Murdoch. He would comply. It was so disappointing to deal with multinational media chief executives like Time Warner Inc.'s Gerald Levin. Mr. Levin had developed a personal relationship with President Jiang Zemin, but he didn't seem able to control his own company's news operations. CNN and Time were always doing stories that angered the Chinese leadership. Mr. Murdoch finally reached the top in 1998 when he met with President Jiang. The meeting was front-page news in China. Mr. Jiang \"expressed appreciation for the efforts made by world media mogul Rupert Murdoch in presenting China objectively and cooperating with the Chinese press over the past two years.\" Once Mr. Murdoch got his chance to tell his story to Chinese leaders face-to-face, they saw eye to eye, dictator to dictator. ---",

The country is experiencing rapid urbanization, the growth of a consumer class, and economic expansion. In 1997, News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch sought to establish business relations in China's media market. This followed a period of tension that began in 1993 when Murdoch made a speech in London regarding communications technology and its implications for governance. Chinese officials interpreted the remarks as critical, leading to regulatory restrictions on satellite television ownership. Over the next four years, Murdoch engaged in efforts to improve relations with Chinese leadership. These included business negotiations, philanthropic contributions, and adjustments to programming content. In October 1997, Murdoch met with Communist Party official Ding Guangen at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. During the meeting, they discussed potential cooperation between News Corp. and Chinese media entities. Subsequently, Murdoch's business activities in China progressed, including a 1998 meeting with then-President Jiang Zemin. The Chinese government acknowledged Murdoch's efforts to collaborate with domestic media organizations."

        "title": "inside IT: Virtual pageant honours beauty... and the bust",
        "original_text": "There was no swimsuit parade, stomach-churning acceptance speech or even a paean to world peace. But just as the Icelandic part-time policewoman Unnur Birna Vilhjalmsdottir was crowned Miss World 2005 at the weekend at a ceremony in China, a simultaneous event in cyberspace saw the virtual Asian beauty \"Mi\" christened Miss Digital World 2005. The online competition had all the glitz of its human equivalent - as underlined by the vital statistics of the winner. Created by Japanese designer Ichi Yoshimoto, the 163cm tall beauty has \"slick\" black hair, brown eyes and weighs in at 88-58-89 (that's 34-23-35 in old money). In one image, Mi is portrayed looking coy in a kimono, but her video showreel reveals her kitted out in futuristic silver bondage gear and felling a demonic robot with a vicious roundhouse kick. Mi was one of 21 virtual women created by digital artists for the competition organised by Monumedia, an Italian multimedia company. The brief was to create a \"contemporary ideal of beauty through virtual reality\", according to designer Franz Cerami, who dreamed up the competition. In a scene reminiscent of the 1985 movie Weird Science, which saw two teenage geeks create a virtual woman (played by former model Kelly LeBrock), designers from as far afield as India, Japan, Brazil and Argentina, tried to fulfil Cerami's brief. Fighting for the grand prize of a $5,000 (£2,835) gold bar, contestants drew inspiration from computer game characters, movie stars and celebrities. The results were, from the technical viewpoint, impressive. Admittedly, Lara Croft's DNA lives on: some of the chest characteristics were disproportionate, and the bust area saw particular attention to detail. But the majority of entries were scarily lifelike. Some were so realistic that the only things that betrayed their digital existence were minor physical details such as robotic body movements, and the absence of blinking. But what do real women make of these visions of digital perfection? Is it just a case of lonely geeks sitting in their bedrooms salivating over an exaggerated idea of beauty, or are their creations a lovingly crafted homage to the female form? Katie Lee, editor of the girls' gadgets website Shiny Shiny, sees little difference between the digital creations and today's C-list celebrities. \"The virtual women all look quite feisty to me, and they're no more a projection of male fantasy than the various semi-clad silicone women in the likes of Zoo or Nuts,\" she says. \"In fact, there's a bit more romance to them than that - it's obvious they've been created with a lot of care. Sure, that's still on the wrong side of creepy, and some seem to have improbably large breasts, but I'm finding it hard to get upset about it. These boys don't get to meet many real women, after all.\" However, online fashion journalist Sam Lyster is less convinced. \"Although I hate to say it, the whole thing comes across as men who are unable to relate to real women retreating into a fantasy world where they can create their own version of femininity, which I imagine includes such physical characteristics as being mute except for when they are praising the masculinity and prowess of their creators. It is,\" she concludes, \"a little bit sad.\" · If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com",

The winner, 'Mi,' was designed by Japanese creator Ichi Yoshimoto, with specified physical attributes including height, hair color, eye color, and measurements. Mi was depicted in both traditional and futuristic attire across different media. The competition's goal was to create a 'contemporary ideal of beauty through virtual reality,' according to organizer Franz Cerami. Participants competed for a $5,000 gold bar, drawing inspiration from pop culture figures. The technical execution of the entries varied, with some showcasing highly realistic features while others displayed minor artificial details.

        "title": "Dance: Henri Oguike | National Beijing Opera Company of China | The Dream",
        "original_text": "The following apology was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday May 29 2005 We confused ancient Chinese and Japanese cultures in the headline above, 'The way of the samurai'. The piece praises the dancing of the National Beijing Opera Company. Henri Oguike Bury St Edmunds National Beijing Opera Company of China Sadler's Wells, London EC1 The Dream ROH, London WC2 St Edmundsbury Cathedral is about to be finished, after 500 years. A neo-gothic central tower has finally been added with the help of millennium lottery money. To celebrate its near completion, Bury St Edmunds Festival and DanceEast commissioned the Britten Sinfonia and Henri Oguike's dance company to perform in the nave. They gave the world premiere of Steve Martland's Tiger Dancing, written for the company and, in honour of Sir Michael Tippett's centenary year, his 1939 Concerto for Double String Orchestra, choreographed for the first time. The dance part of the concert was completed by Oguike's signature work, Front Line, to Shostakovich's String Quartet No 9. Since it's a piece in which the sound of the dancer's pounding feet amplifies the frenzy of the music, the noisy, makeshift stage was -peculiarly appropriate. The thumps distracted, though, during the Tippett. Dressed in shades of green, 10 dancers were celebrants of spring, bringing the abbey gardens into the church. Wheeling and re-forming to absorb each soloist, they made up a companionable congregation. Isolated in the slow movement, Nuno Silva contemplated his envelope of flesh, reached out in anguish, sighed with the strings. When the others returned, joyous Sarita Piotrowski was the only one left behind, Silva's serene counterpart. A beautiful piece, it confirms Oguike as an outstandingly musical choreographer, as lovable as Mark Morris. Tiger Dancing, however, fails to match Martland's variations on the Blake poem he set to music. Dancers in slashed catsuits prowled around the nave pillars, their motifs too often repeated, their confrontations over-extended. The music is ecstatic, hyper-alert; Oguike's response is so sketchy that he needs to start over before taking any tigers into the company's repertoire. Troupe Two, despite its name as the top touring arm of China's National Beijing Opera Company, has never been to Britain before. Set up after Madam Mao's death, it draws on the centuries-old tradition of what used to be known as Peking Opera - a heritage vandalised by Mao's Cultural Revolution. The sagas have been splendidly restored and new ones created, for television as well as the stage. The link between the old melodramas and modern martial arts movies is clear. The plots are preposterous, the action thrilling; warriors fly through the air wielding huge swords, scissor-kicking opponents to pulp. But these theatrical acrobats have no need of wires. Their fight routines are elaborately choreographed, involving banners, pikes and lances as well as backflips and barrel rolls. Leading up to the spectacular water battle in Legend of the White Snake, a romance unfolds in song and dance about the marriage between an enchanted woman and an ordinary mortal. Although such unions are bound to end badly, there are sweetly comic episodes en route, more soap opera than high drama. The pink-faced husband (Zhang Wei), hopeless in a crisis, is very touching; the two women, poignant Li Shengsu as the White Snake and Huang Hua, funny and feisty as the Green Snake, are magnificent. Video screens on either side of the stage provide translations of the high-pitched singing, while the stylised action speaks for itself. The on-stage orchestra is ear-shattering, keeping everyone on their pom-pommed toes. What I hadn't expected was how rounded the characters could be beneath their vividly painted faces and ornate costumes. Legend of the White Snake, which tours this week to both Edinburgh and Salisbury, is an epic charmer. Supernatural beings abound in Ashton's The Dream, part of the Royal Ballet's latest triple bill. Johan Kobborg and Alina Cojocaru make Oberon and Titania into feral fairies, remote from human frailty. Edward Watson and Leanne Benjamin understand more warmly how love makes fools of everyone. They're closer to Ashton's compassion, but both casts accomplish his fiendishly fleet steps with aplomb. The mortal lovers are unusually restrained, allowing the choreography to make the jokes for them, with Vanessa Palmer the most sympathetic Helena yet.",

        "original_text": "ghamilton@mon.nationalpost.com\nMONTREAL - On the surface, Montreal looks to be a pretty happy place this summer. Another successful jazz festival has just ended, and the first laughs can be heard from the comedy festival. The world's best swimmers and divers are arriving this weekend to compete in the aquatic championships, to be followed next month by the top men's tennis players. What could possibly rain on this parade?\nWell, you could try talking baseball. For one group of Montrealers, diehard Expos fans, it is hard to smile when your team is gone.\n\"I'm not surviving. I had a very bad winter,\" Katie Hynes, one of the Expos' biggest fans, said over the phone this week. \"I think I can go 20 minutes now without thinking of them. Before it was every second, now it's 20 minutes.\" When it was suggested that at least she had more time to devote to other interests, she was not amused.\n\"Why do you feel the need to buy me a new puppy after mine died? Why can't you let me grieve?\" she asked. \"I'm a firm believer that you never get over things. You just learn to cope. It will always be there in the back of my brain.\"\nMs. Hynes, 48, who was a season-ticket holder through the Expos' 28 years at Olympic Stadium, said there are \"lots of people\" feeling as blue as she does, and to prove it she arranged a meeting at a downtown pub with some of her friends.\nThere was Micheline Senia, who got a job selling beer in the stands so she could follow her beloved Expos; Geoff Donaldson who moved to Montreal from London, Ont., six years ago, in part so he could be near his favourite team; and Tim Walsh, recently returned from a trip to Chicago where he cheered against his former team, now playing as the Washington Nationals.\nAs if losing the Expos was not bad enough, a team that made the playoffs just once during its 36 years in Montreal is now in first place in its division since moving to Washington, D.C., last winter. \"I'm rooting for anyone to beat the Nationals,\" Mr. Walsh, 40, said. \"Anyone. Anyone.\"\nLike addicts denied their fix, the fans without a team have looked elsewhere for the high they used to feel at the Big O. Ms. Hynes and Mr. Walsh thought it might be a good idea to take in the Nationals' first trip to Toronto to play the Blue Jays. That turned out to be a mistake.\n\"I was vacillating between depression, anger and sadness,\" Mr. Walsh recalled. \"It was really weird seeing those guys in a different uniform.\" He had already bought the tickets for the Chicago trip this month, but said that will be the last time he watches the former Expos.\n\"No more Nationals for me,\" he said. \"It's awful. It's no fun. They're not the Expos. Major League Baseball came in and murdered our team.\"\nA bunch of them went to the home opener of the Triple-A Ottawa Lynx. \"We sat there and looked at each other and said, 'Wow, this is a demotion,' \" Ms. Hynes said. \"Don't get me wrong. I love minor league baseball. But what have I been doing for the last 36 years? I was in the show.\"\nMs. Senia, 32, said the loss of the Expos did not fully hit her until she walked into a sports bar this spring and the Nationals were on TV. \"It was a home game, and I said, 'What's going on here? If it's a home game I should be there.' \"\nShe attends amateur games in Montreal, and Mr. Donaldson, 29, has begun playing in a hardball league. But he feels betrayed by his adopted city. \"I was pissed off at everyone in Montreal,\" he said. \"I came all the way here for one reason, to watch the Expos, and nobody would even go to the games.\"\nMs. Hynes, who was featured in a 2002 documentary about the Expos' slow death, finds she cannot escape the ghosts of the Expos, no matter how hard she tries. \"I'll be on the metro at eight in the morning, and I'll see an old Chinese lady wearing an Expos cap, and it just destroys me,\" she said.",
        "debiased_text": "MONTREAL - Montreal is currently hosting several major events this summer. The jazz festival recently concluded, and the comedy festival has started. The aquatic championships will begin this weekend, followed by a men's tennis tournament next month. However, for some Montreal residents, particularly former Expos baseball fans, the absence of the team remains a point of discussion. The Expos relocated to Washington, D.C., last year and now compete as the Washington Nationals. Several former fans shared their perspectives on the team's departure. Katie Hynes, a 48-year-old former season-ticket holder, stated she continues to feel the loss of the team. Micheline Senia, Geoff Donaldson, and Tim Walsh, also longtime Expos fans, described their reactions to the team's absence and their attempts to adjust. Some have attended minor league or amateur games, while others, like Walsh, have chosen to disengage from following the Nationals. The Expos made the playoffs once during their 36 years in Montreal and are currently leading their division in Washington."

        "title": "Blair raises 'question mark' on China's human rights",
        "original_text": "Tony Blair today told the Chinese prime minister the world held a \"question mark\" over China's human rights record, as he ended a two-day trip to Beijing. The PM divided his final day between three hours of talks with his opposite number, Wen Jiabao, and a flurry of sporting and cultural performances aimed at highlighting Anglo-Chinese links - China and Britain will host the Olympics in 2008 and 2012 respectively. Mr Blair heads to India tonight after a 48-hour visit whose final leg was marred when a vehicle in the official convoy overturned on a motorway, slightly injuring a Number 10 aide and an accompanying journalist. However, none of the injuries were thought to be serious. After talks with Mr Wen this morning, Beijing time, Mr Blair said people around the world held a \"question mark\" over his country's record on issues such as human rights. But he set a target for Britain's trade with China to reach $40bn (£21.7bn) by 2010. Today Airbus UK announced orders from China for 10 aircraft worth $1.5bn (£81 million). The PM told reporters after the talks: \"I said [to Mr Wen] it's not that people resent China, but they have got a question mark because they see this enormous economic power and they ask 'Will this developing economy be matched by political development and development in the field of human rights as well?' \"His answer to me was that China faced enormous challenges because you have got a relatively wealthy part of China but many, many poor people.\" Mr Blair added: \"The whole basis of the discussion I have had in a country that's developing very fast - it's going to be the second largest economy in the world very shortly - that there's an unstoppable momentum there towards greater political freedom, progress on human rights and those other issues, and I think there's an understanding that that should happen. \"Whether it does happen or not, time will tell.\" But Mr Blair also said that, unlike on his previous two visits to China, \"there was no desire to escape this topic, there was a genuine sense of engagement\". With Beijing hosting the Olympics in 2008, and London four years later, the PM later visited a soccer stadium and athletics track, where he was put through his paces at running and passing by the former Newcastle United manager, Sir Bobby Robson. As Mr Blair repeatedly failed to finish the move by scoring, Sir Bobby insisted: \"One more time! One more time!\" Finally the premier scored from close range. Asked if his favourite club Newcastle United's new buy Michael Owen would do better, Mr Blair replied: \"He'd better.\" Confronted by the world 110-metre hurdles record-holder, Colin Jackson, and a string of hurdles, the prime minister - whose sporting prowess was being witnessed by Mrs Blair - simply waved his arms and insisted, to laughter: \"Definitely not!\" While watching the hurdles, Mr Blair was confronted by a young Chinese man who said that on an earlier visit to China he had asked the PM for his tie and that he had responded by promising it to him if they ever met again. Reminded of his promise, Mr Blair took off his stylish London Olympic bid tie and handed it over. At their final cultural engagement of the day, Mr and Mrs Blair watched 20 young Chinese ballet dancers in black tutus being put through their paces by the British ballerina Darcy Bussell. By this time Mr Blair's tie had been replaced by a smart blue number. · Meanwhile, the EU trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, said today he was confident the 25 member states would approve his deal with China to end the \"bra wars\" trade dispute. The textile dispute has left about 75m Chinese-made garments, ranging from bras to pullovers, stockpiled in customs warehouses at EU ports after Beijing exceeded 2005 textile export quotas. Under a deal struck in Beijing following several days of tough negotiations and due to be considered by EU member states today, half of the clothes backed up in European ports will be allowed in outside the quotas. The other half will be deducted by the Chinese from future years' quotas. Interviewed on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Mr Mandelson was asked whether he was confident that the EU states would accept the deal. Mr Mandelson said: \"I am confident because the initial discussions have indicated that member states are giving a warm welcome. \"That may not be universal, but I hope they will consider on its merits what I have agreed, partly because it is good for Europe and good for China, and that is what I wanted to achieve, but also because there is no alternative to what I'm proposing.\"",
        "debiased_text": "Tony Blair concluded a two-day visit to Beijing with discussions focused on trade and human rights during a meeting with Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. The two leaders engaged in three hours of talks, after which Blair stated that international observers have questions regarding China's human rights progress. He also expressed a goal to increase UK-China trade to $40bn by 2010. During the visit, Airbus UK secured orders for 10 aircraft worth $1.5bn from China. Blair noted that China acknowledges its challenges, including economic disparities and political development. He observed that discussions indicated a willingness to engage on these topics, unlike in previous visits. Blair's schedule included cultural and sporting events highlighting UK-China ties ahead of their respective Olympics in 2008 and 2012. During a soccer demonstration, Blair participated in drills alongside former Newcastle United manager Sir Bobby Robson. Separately, the EU trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, announced a provisional agreement with China to resolve a textile trade dispute, pending approval by EU member states. The deal would release half of the held-up Chinese garments into the EU market, with the remainder counted against future quotas."

        "title": "Formula one: Raikkonen on pole as Ferrari falter",
        "original_text": "Formula one's first visit to Turkey seems to have put many drivers in a spin, not least the world champion as Michael Schumacher made a mistake and dropped to the back end of the grid for today's grand prix. Even Kimi Raikkonen made an error on his qualifying lap, but it was not serious enough to cost the McLaren-Mercedes driver his fifth pole position of the season. Jenson Button was less fortunate. Having settled in better than most to the new 5.3km track during free practice, Button was caught out at Turn 8, a very long left-hander that is already certain to join the list of the world's most difficult corners. Button had been fastest of all until that point, but a bump, barely discernible to the eye, unsettled the stiffly-sprung BAR-Honda at 135 mph and caused the Englishman to run wide, dropping him to an eventual thirteenth on the grid. 'It's really disappointing,' said Button. 'In practice today, we didn't have any issues with the high-speed corner, but we could see that other teams were struggling through there. It's a shame because we have been quick so far this weekend.' Even if the BAR is not quite up to the pace of the McLaren, Button ought to have been able to join Raikkonen on the front row and add further problems for Fernando Alonso, the leader of the championship. Alonso will start from third, beaten by Giancarlo Fisichella and therefore having to deal with his Renault team-mate before getting on terms with Raikkonen. 'The conditions were much windier this afternoon than we had in practice, and we saw that it was a difficult qualifying session for all the drivers as lots of people went off,' said Alonso. 'In that situation, you have to take the gamble of either taking some risks, or being conservative: I pushed hard and came through OK, so it is great to be third, on the clean side of the grid. 'The wind actually surprised me a little bit down the back straight - it was a strong tailwind, and I braked at my normal point, but missed the apex, which cost me some time. We have both cars in the top three and I will go into the race with the aim of trying to beat Kimi.' Gusting wind has been one of the many complications associated with a circuit that most drivers only got to see for the first time on Thursday. The Istanbul Park track, 30 miles east of the city and in the Asian sector of the country, breaks the mould of recent new circuits such as Bahrain, noted for its bland and uninteresting layout. These two tracks, plus the venues in Malaysia and China, have been designed by Hermann Tilke. The German architect may have accidentally hit on a novel method for making future circuits as tricky as this one. Having followed the usual pattern of penning a layout to run in a clockwise direction, Tilke realised that Istanbul Park might actually be more challenging if used in the reverse direction to the one originally intended. Thus, Istanbul joins Imola and Interlagos as being the only anti-clockwise tracks in the 19-race season, a novelty that brings problems for drivers' neck muscles that have become accustomed to circuits with a predominant number of right-hand corners. Significantly, the now notorious Turn 8 goes left in a long arc that will seek out muscular weaknesses and create problems for right-front tyres as the 58-lap race reaches its final stages. All four tyres on Schumacher's Ferrari appear to be causing trouble already as Bridgestone shows signs of failing to estimate correctly the type of rubber necessary to cope with a track that was an unknown quantity until Friday. His spin notwithstanding, Schumacher was never likely to get his Ferrari near the front of the grid, an uncomfortable fact supported by Rubens Barrichello doing no better than the eleventh fastest time. 'The qualifying results were not quite what we'd hoped for,' said Ross Brawn, Ferrari's technical director. 'After this morning's session [Schumacher fourteenth fastest, Barrichello sixteenth], we changed our approach and perhaps we are carrying a bit more fuel than other people. However, we didn't seem to be quite as quick in qualifying as expected. I think Michael may have got into a top-six position. But the car just got away from him at Turn 9 and that was it. 'Track temperatures did go up four or five degrees before qualifying and, of course, there was a lot of dust on the track with people going off all over the place, so it wasn't easy.' Schumacher acquainted himself with the 14-turn layout by using a scooter on Thursday, only to find that he needed to revise his opinion of the correct racing line when seated much lower in his Ferrari. It is difficult to see the apex of certain corners thanks to an elevation change in places of 42 metres, the most significant of any man-made circuit on the calendar. The effect of a number of blind brows may be deadened when seen through a television lens, but it will be real enough for 20 drivers as they set out at the start of round 14 of the championship. Judging by the many minor incidents during practice and qualifying, as well as during the GP2 support race yesterday (won by Alex Premat with Britain's Adam Carroll finishing seventh), today's race is likely to be one of the most eventful of the season. Alonso's main preoccupation will be to keep out of trouble and avoid a first-corner collision such as the one that wiped the nose from his Renault and dropped him out of the points at the last race in Hungary. Significantly, another win for Raikkonen under similar circumstances will throw the championship wide open with five races to run.",
        "debiased_text": "During the qualifying session for the Turkish Grand Prix, several drivers encountered challenges on the new Istanbul Park circuit. Michael Schumacher made an error that resulted in a starting position at the back of the grid. Kimi Räikkönen also had a mistake during his qualifying lap but secured his fifth pole position of the season. Jenson Button, who had been fast in practice, lost control at Turn 8, leading to a 13th-place starting position. Button noted that while his team had no issues with the high-speed corner in practice, other teams struggled there. Fernando Alonso qualified in third place, behind Giancarlo Fisichella. Alonso mentioned that windier conditions made qualifying difficult for all drivers. The Istanbul Park circuit, designed by Hermann Tilke, is one of three anti-clockwise tracks on the 19-race calendar. Its layout, particularly Turn 8, presents physical challenges for drivers. Schumacher's Ferrari faced tire-related issues, with Bridgestone appearing to struggle with rubber selection for the new track. Ferrari’s technical director, Ross Brawn, stated that the team adjusted its approach after practice but did not achieve the expected qualifying performance. Track conditions, including dust and temperature changes, added to the challenges. The circuit’s elevation changes and blind corners also posed difficulties. The race is anticipated to be eventful, with Alonso aiming to avoid incidents like the first-corner collision that affected him in the previous race in Hungary. A win by Räikkönen could impact the championship standings with five races remaining."

        "title": "Japan rejects 'scary' China's war demands",
        "original_text": "A diplomatic row between China and Japan escalated further yesterday when the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, called on Tokyo to \"face up to\" its wartime atrocities, saying it should reconsider its bid for a permanent seat on the UN security council. Speaking to reporters during a visit to India, Mr Wen said recent anti-Japanese demonstrations in China showed widespread opposition to Japan's membership bid as long as it continues to ignore unpleasant facts about its history. \"Only a country that respects history, takes responsibility for [the past] and wins the trust of people in Asia and the world can take on greater responsibilities in the international community,\" he said. On Saturday, thousands of Chinese demonstrators took to the streets after the Japanese education ministry approved history textbooks which critics say whitewash Japan's conduct in China and other parts of Asia before and during the second world war. It is not the first time China has complained about history textbooks, which, it says, ignore the horror of imperial Japan's forays in Asia in the 1930s, when it forced tens of thousands of women to work in frontline brothels and conducted chemical and biological weapons experiments on civilians. One of the books merely refers to the slaying by Japanese troops of as many as 300,000 civilians in Nanjing in 1937 as an \"incident\". \"The core issue in China-Japan relations is that Japan needs to squarely face up to history,\" Mr Wen said. The recent wave of anti-Japanese sentiment received more impetus yesterday when Chinese media reported the discovery of chemical weapons left behind by the Japanese army at the end of the war. Newspapers reported that 20 mortar rounds and gas bombs had been found late last month. Though the countries have worked together to remove the weapons, their frequent discovery in north-east China creates extra resentment. Despite the protests, Japan has shown no sign of agreeing to China's demands. Instead, it has called for an apology and compensation for the damage caused by rioters over the weekend, as well as assurances that Japanese expatriates will be protected. Shoichi Nakagawa, Japan's trade minister, yesterday denounced China as \"scary\" and said he was concerned about the protests' impact on Japanese businesses there. \"They're a country that's trying to become a market economy and we need them to respond properly. It's a scary country.\" The row over textbooks is just one of several issues that divide the east Asian rivals. They are in dispute over the Senkaku/ Daiyou islands in the East China Sea and over exploration rights to natural gas fields beneath the seabed. But economic ties have grown dramatically in recent years and leaders on both sides talk of the need for dialogue to resolve differences. Previous rows over textbooks have died down, but observers say the prospect of China - a member of the UN security council - blocking Japan's bid for membership could do more lasting damage to bilateral ties. A Chinese official yesterday defended Beijing's handling of the weekend's violent protests during which some 1,000 demonstrators threw stones at the Japanese embassy in the capital, and did not respond to Tokyo's calls for an apology. A foreign ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, described the protests as \"spontaneous\", adding that they were the result of \"the wrong practice and attitude adopted by Japan side on its history of aggression\". Junichiro Koizumi, the Japanese prime minister, dismissed Mr Qin's claim. \"There are differences between Japan and China on that point,\" he told reporters.",
        "debiased_text": "A diplomatic dispute between China and Japan continued yesterday as Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao stated that Tokyo should address historical issues related to its wartime actions and reconsider its bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. During a visit to India, Wen noted that recent protests in China reflected opposition to Japan's UN membership bid due to concerns about its historical narrative. He emphasized that countries seeking greater international roles should acknowledge history and maintain regional trust. On Saturday, demonstrations occurred in China after Japan's education ministry approved history textbooks that some argue downplay Japan's actions in Asia before and during World War II. China has previously objected to such textbooks, stating they omit details of Japan's military activities in the 1930s, including forced labor and wartime experiments. One textbook refers to the 1937 Nanjing civilian casualties as an 'incident.' Wen described historical acknowledgment as central to bilateral relations. Meanwhile, Chinese media reported the discovery of leftover Japanese chemical weapons in northeast China, an issue that has been addressed through joint disposal efforts. Japan has not indicated it will meet China's demands regarding historical matters. Instead, it has requested apologies and compensation for property damage during recent protests, as well as protections for Japanese citizens in China. Japanese Trade Minister Shoichi Nakagawa expressed concerns about the protests' effect on Japanese businesses in China, calling the situation 'concerning.' The textbook dispute is one of several ongoing issues between the two nations, including territorial disagreements in the East China Sea and gas exploration rights. Despite these tensions, economic ties have expanded, and both governments have emphasized diplomatic solutions. Previous disputes over textbooks have subsided, but some observers suggest China's potential opposition to Japan's UN bid could affect long-term relations. Chinese officials defended their response to the protests, which included demonstrators throwing stones at the Japanese embassy in Beijing, describing the events as spontaneous reactions to Japan's historical stance. Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi disagreed with this characterization, acknowledging differing perspectives between the two countries."

        "original_text": "Blodget is writing a series for Slate.com on the China gold rush, from which this article is adapted. A former top-ranked Wall Street analyst, Blodget was a party to the global settlement of a regulatory investigation into conflicts of interest at brokerage firms, which precludes him from working in the securities industry. When the ducks are quacking, the saying goes, Wall Street feeds them, and right now we ducks are quacking for a steady diet of China- related investment opportunities. If China's economic miracle ends the way many do (e.g., Japan), we will blame Wall Street for our misery. But we should proceed with our eyes open. China is the hottest business and investment story on the planet. The 21st century has already been proclaimed the \"Chinese century,\" and shock waves from China's frenzied entrepreneurialism, manufacturing prowess and low-cost labor are rocking industries throughout the world. As in every gold rush, fortunes are being made, and each new tale of a freshly minted zillionaire fuels the China fever. China is the biggest growth story in history. We can't afford to miss it! Well, we aren't going to miss it, because, like other economic tidal waves (the Internet, for example), China will affect us whether we invest in the country or not. And before we rush in, we should remember that the Internet craze melted down not so long ago, and one other megatrend, real estate, may yet do the same. But we wouldn't be human if we didn't dream, and China's size and three decades of spectacular wealth creation certainly offer much in the way of inspiration. So how can we cash in? The safest but most labor-intensive China investment strategy is to move to the country, learn the language(s) and settle in for a decade or two. This way, you can be close to the action, and if you don't strike it rich on your own you can sell your China expertise to someone else. If you're not up for this level of commitment you can buy China-related securities, either directly or through funds. For example, there are the \"A shares\" and \"B shares\" of companies listed on China's domestic stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen. However, the A shares are tough to buy and the B shares offer a limited selection. Given the embryonic state of China's legal, accounting and regulatory systems, this is probably good: your odds of hitting the jackpot in Shanghai or Shenzhen are worse than in Las Vegas. Then there are the \"H shares\" and \"red chips,\" Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong. Most of these companies are controlled by the Chinese government, but they tend to be real companies (as opposed to some of the horrors listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen). If you don't want to deal with the hassle of global trades, cross-border ownership, foreign taxes and currency conversion, you can also buy the American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Chinese companies listed in New York. These companies must meet American reporting requirements, and are therefore as scrubbed as any China securities (which isn't saying much). If you go this last route, of course, sometimes what you will be buying is not the actual stock of a Chinese company, but the stock of, say, a Cayman Islands company that has a contractual relationship with a Chinese company, one that you must pray will last longer than many contractual relationships in China (where contracts are often viewed as a snapshot of an ever-evolving arrangement). The same Chinese companies also occasionally list stock simultaneously in Shanghai, Hong Kong and New York, and trade at different prices on each market--so you might end up paying more for the same asset than a professional investor with global reach. Which brings up a key point, one that is often lost in the din of do-it-yourself investing propaganda: you can buy China stocks, if you really want to, but there is absolutely no reason for you to do so. On the contrary, there are dozens of reasons for you not to do so, starting with the competition. China is hot, which means that lots of professionals are investing in the country, and most of them probably know more about it than you do. This may sound heretical: in the United States, we love to imagine that with an Internet connection and a few minutes of spare time we can go head-to-head with full-time professionals. Sadly, this is ludicrous. We can't compete on the PGA Tour after hitting a couple of buckets of range balls, and we shouldn't expect to be able to compete against professional investors after reading a couple of SEC filings--especially in an emerging market half a world away. Professional China investors live in China, speak Chinese, visit Chinese companies, drink baijiu with Chinese managers, schmooze with Chinese lawmakers and party members and have dozens of China- focused Wall Street analysts calling them day and night with every crumb of China-related information they find. These investors have multimillion-dollar research budgets, deep China expertise and armies of Chinese analysts, and many were born and raised in the country (before being educated at Harvard et al.). Once in a while we may uncover some gem that these experts miss, but chances are slim that we can do it consistently. So if buying individual China stocks sounds nerve-racking, you can (wisely) opt for a mutual fund. But here, too, beware. Even dime- a-dozen U.S. funds often charge egregious fees, and fees on foreign ones can be especially steep (2 percent of assets per year, or more). Also, although many China funds have posted excellent performance over the past few years, this performance may have been the result of market trends or luck (the H shares, for example, have had a strong three years). It may be true, as some argue, that China's markets are so inefficient that most managers can deliver above-market performance (contrary to the case in the United States, where they can't), but the jury is still out on this. In any event, you're probably best off seeking low-cost active funds, passive index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The paradox of China investing these days is that even though the economy is screaming along, China's domestic markets are sucking wind--and have been for years. Economic performance and stock performance do occasionally diverge, but China's markets are also saddled with other problems, including big blocks of untradable state-owned shares, high valuations and limited market access. The six-year downtrend has destroyed investor confidence, and China's once manic little guys are feeling surly and discouraged. Normally, this is an excellent time to buy, but in the case of China's markets the decline has only rendered stocks \"expensive\" instead of \"outrageous.\" Data are hard to come by, but most reports suggest that they're still miles from \"cheap.\" In Hong Kong and New York, on the other hand, China stocks may actually be cheap. Merrill Lynch, for example, estimates that the Hong Kong H shares are trading at about 11 times 2005 estimated earnings, versus a long-term U.S. average of about 16 times earnings, and this valuation appears attractive for long-term investors. Whether this is the result of the market's anticipating an economic slowdown or simply an appropriate discount to compensate for China's risks and uncertainties, is unclear, but at least the stocks don't appear to be incorporating much of a China premium. But this still doesn't mean that it makes sense to buy them. Despite the attractiveness of China's long-term story--presumed future economic superpower and so on--its stocks are still just a subset of a minor asset class: emerging-market equities. As such they should constitute, at most, only a tiny fraction of the average portfolio. China, moreover, is only one of dozens of emerging markets--it currently represents only 7 percent of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, for example--so the total China exposure should usually be far less than 1 percent of assets. Most investors can get all the China exposure they need by owning U.S. companies that do business there or small helpings of Asian and emerging-markets funds. (It has been suggested that investors can also \"play China\" by buying commodities, but if you do this, please recognize that you are not \"investing in China\" but \"trading commodities,\" which is one of the riskiest and most difficult market endeavors there are.) If you simply can't stand not having some direct China exposure, then the best bet is probably a low-cost, diversified country fund or ETF. Before pulling the trigger, however, remember that in addition to the possibility of posting impressive gains, you may lose most of your money and/or sit stagnant for decades. Remember Japan, the last great Asian investment opportunity? Its chief stock index, the Nikkei, currently trades at approximately one quarter of its 1989 peak. China's stocks are much less expensive now than Japan's were then, so the downside is probably not so extreme, but such are the perils of chasing economic miracles. And then there's another instructive comparison, one that lays out the potential upside if things in China go right. Commentators often compare China today to the United States 100 years ago. In those days America was also an \"emerging market,\" so it's worth reviewing how its stock markets have performed. In the past 200 years, U.S. stocks have returned an average of about 10 percent per year (7 percent after inflation). If China continues to roll, this return is probably in the neighborhood of what long-term China investors can expect. But be careful: \"long term\" really means long term (30 years). The performance of the U.S. economy in the 20th century was breathtaking. Yet in the same period, U.S. stocks went through three major bull markets and three major bear markets, and devastating crashes wiped out generations of investors along the way. Despite the economy, in other words, for vast stretches of the century--1901 to 1920, for example, or 1966 to 1982--U.S. stocks were dogs. China may or may not turn out to the \"the next United States,\" but regardless, it won't be a smooth ride.",

        "original_text": "After eight years of struggling to make it as a musician -- years of searching for new sounds, sloughing off self-doubts, overcoming conflicts with collaborators and resisting pressure from parents and in-laws \"to get a real job\" -- singer Angel Garcia recently had a vision of his mission while on a beach in Yucatan.\nGarcia, co-founder of the lauded unsigned alt-Latino duo named Mezklah, says he dropped LSD near the Maya ruins of Tulum and while hallucinating \"got a sense of the permeability of the cosmos.\" He recalls perceiving the subconscious hand of ancient cultures -- Egyptian, Chinese, Arabic -- influencing the bold designs he paints on his lean and lizard-like body before performances. He noticed the odd assortment of people passing by -- soldiers, European tourists, \"trippy characters\" -- that led to a realization about the interconnectedness of the world.\n\"I could see it so clearly,\" says Garcia, the songwriting half of the duo with guitarist Greg Hernandez. \"I saw that we weren't only representing the Latin community, but we were representing the whole world community, in a sense. And I felt this huge responsibility to everybody. In my time here on Earth, I felt like I need to let this out. I felt I had something special, a certain way of combining music. This is my strength. This is my purpose in life.\"\nMezklah, which performs Sunday in a benefit for a collective of farming families in South-Central L.A., has started to gain attention from the music business with its \"tribal electronica,\" a seemingly incongruous confluence of reggae, trip-hop, drums-and- bass, cumbia and hip-hop. Earlier this year, the group rose above scores of competitors to win an annual battle of the bands in Southern California's buzzing rock en espanol scene.\nThe originality and passion of these sons of immigrants also won over Versa Manos, a publicist who volunteered to represent the group pro bono after seeing it perform in 2003. Manos, whose Gorgeous PR handles Tupac Shakur's estate and other corporate entertainment clients, communicated her excitement about the band to Nic Harcourt, host of KCRW's \"Morning Becomes Eclectic,\" who decided to air tracks from Mezklah's self-released CD, \"SpyderMonkey.\"\nIt's one of the rare times a local Latino band has made it on Harcourt's cutting-edge show, which occasionally spotlights the best of Latin alternative music, mostly from other countries.\n\"No matter what it is that I play, from L.A. or New York or England or Mexico or France or whatever, it has to grab me as being a little different and standing out from the pack,\" said Harcourt, who auditions 400 CDs per week. \"So it's got to be something that grabs you pretty quickly, and there was something about that [Mezklah] sound.\"\nGarcia, 32, and Hernandez, 33, have been developing that sound since they met in 1997, introduced by a mutual friend from the Jazz Bakery, where Garcia worked as a server in the cafe. They were delighted to find each other, since neither had been able to click with other musicians.\nOriginally, they had doubts about performing as a duo in a land of bands. But being compact and using tracks stored on an iPod for musical backing instead of instruments gave them the benefit of mobility. That served them well on exploratory tours through Mexico, where they would stop to play at whatever bar or cantina would give them the stage.\nThey cite influences from the Doors and the Clash to Oingo Boingo, Bob Marley and Nirvana, yet name no Latino artists. That music -- the rancheras they grew up with -- runs in their blood, they say.\nGarcia says he didn't start creating music until he was 18 and didn't compose in Spanish until he started Mezklah, a deliberate misspelling of mezcla, the Spanish word for \"mixture.\" That's hard to believe considering the quality of his poetic and onomatopoeic lyrics, reinforced by melodic lines that shift from a skittish hip- hop cadence to a smooth and lyrical sway with Caribbean overtones.\nThough its sound sets it apart, Mezklah also is part of a loosely knit community of L.A. Chicano/Latino bands that combine art with activism. The duo helped organize Sunday's benefit for the Alameda Community Garden, a 14-acre farm site in an industrial area south of downtown that is threatened by proposed development. Mezklah will be joined by Quinto Sol, Domingo Siete and Fosforo in a free concert to support the mostly Latino, low-income families who grow corn, cactus and other crops on this urban oasis.\nThey sat for an interview earlier this week at a picnic table on the farm, discussing their music and mystical pastiche of philosophies while a small group of men played dominos at a table nearby. Once in the midst of the farmland, the city seems to vanish. The only urban intrusion is the sound of honking cars, the clanging of a railroad crossing and the roar of frequent freight trains thundering down the tracks.\nGarcia and Hernandez lament that they often get pigeonholed as just another Latino band from L.A., which means they're expected to sound like Los Lobos or Ozomatli.\n\"I want people to break that mold they've got us in,\" says Garcia. \"We're proud of that [heritage], but it's a new time now. As a people, we're a lot broader and we can go far beyond that.\"\nMezklah is moving forward with plans for a new CD, incorporating even more global elements, including Middle Eastern rhythms and reggaeton. But it's still a struggle. A distribution deal promised as the prize for the battle of the bands hasn't materialized. Meanwhile, Mezklah still works to convert fans one by one.\nHernandez, sporting long braids in his hair and a goatee, said he realizes that charting a musical path can still be a lonely pursuit.\n\"It still seems like you're going to church to search,\" says Hernandez, noting Mezklah has played shows to as few as five fans. \"You're doing it for your own soul.\"",
        "debiased_text": "Singer Angel Garcia, co-founder of the unsigned musical duo Mezklah, described an experience he had while visiting the Maya ruins of Tulum in Yucatan. During this visit, Garcia took LSD and reported perceiving connections between ancient cultures and his artistic process. He also observed various individuals in the area, which led to reflections on global interconnectedness. Garcia stated that this experience reinforced his sense of purpose in creating music that represents broader cultural influences beyond just the Latin community.\n\nMezklah, an alternative Latino duo consisting of Garcia and guitarist Greg Hernandez, blends genres such as reggae, trip-hop, drums-and-bass, cumbia, and hip-hop. The group recently won a battle of the bands competition in Southern California's rock en español scene.

They cite influences ranging from the Doors and the Clash to Bob Marley and Nirvana but do not specifically mention Latino artists. The duo emphasizes their focus on musical experimentation and mobility, which has allowed them to perform in various venues, including bars and cantinas during tours in Mexico.\n\nMezklah is part of a broader community of Los Angeles-based Chicano/Latino bands that combine music with activism. The duo helped organize the upcoming benefit concert for the Alameda Community Garden, a 14-acre urban farm facing potential development. The event will feature performances by other bands in support of the low-income families who work the land.\n\nDuring an interview at the farm, Garcia and Hernandez discussed their music and artistic philosophy while noting the challenges of being categorized as a conventional Latino band. They expressed a desire to transcend genre expectations and explore broader musical influences, including Middle Eastern rhythms and reggaeton, in their upcoming work.\n\nDespite winning a competition that promised a distribution deal, Mezklah has yet to secure one. The duo continues to build their audience independently. Hernandez acknowledged the difficulties of establishing a unique musical identity but emphasized their commitment to their creative vision."

        "original_text": "The wave of scandals engulfing Chinese business is enough to make even Eliot Spitzer, New York's crusading attorney-general, blanch. Almost every week brings fresh revelations of large-scale fraud, embezzlement and other misdeeds, from branch offices all the way up to the boardroom. This month, the chairman of China Construction Bank (CCB), the country's third largest lender, resigned after allegedly taking bribes - barely a year after its former president was jailed for corruption. At Bank of China, Rmb1bn (Pounds 64.6m) is reported to have gone missing. Meanwhile, eight brokerage houses are being investigated for the disappearance of Rmb6.4bn in clients' funds. And these are only a handful of the most striking recent cases. The government says there has been no sudden increase in corruption, simply that more of it is being exposed. That may be true. Chinese media have become more aggressive in rooting out corporate crime, while the authorities are cracking down harder, particularly on state-owned enterprises, where many of the worst problems lie. Beijing knows it has much to lose. Flagrant asset-stripping by managers of newly-listed companies has already scared many investors away from China's slumping stock market. The successive scandals at CCB have raised doubts about plans to part-privatise the bank and attract a foreign partner this year. Unless the rot is stopped, sources of fresh capital may dry up. However, jailing more offenders and issuing more rules could merely underline the scale of the problem, without resolving it. Much of China's regulatory machinery is weak and highly politicised. The rule of law and due process are largely lacking: indeed, there are suspicions that the targets of some prosecutions are pursued more because they have fallen out with the Communist party leadership than because of their alleged crimes. Furthermore, China's efforts to improve corporate governance rely heavily on measures imposed from the top down. Not only do the authorities lack effective powers - other than prosecutions - to enforce their decisions, but the basic building blocks of corporate accountability, such as boards and independent audit committees, are missing in many companies. Where proper internal controls do exist, they can be evaded, as was shown by last year's derivatives trading fiasco at China Aviation Oil. Establishing an effective framework of business rules and disciplines will be a long haul, calling for much more fundamental reforms than Beijing has yet been ready to consider. While China's growth holds up, it has time to tackle them. But if it fails to act decisively, it faces the risk of a much more serious crisis in the longer term. Until it becomes clearer which direction the country is taking, foreign investors would do well to remember that buying Chinese companies is far from a sure-fire way to share in China's economic success.",
        "debiased_text": "Recent cases involving corporate misconduct in China have drawn attention. China Construction Bank (CCB), the country's third-largest lender, saw its chairman resign this month following allegations of bribery. This occurred approximately one year after the bank's former president was imprisoned for corruption. Separately, reports indicate approximately RMB 1 billion is unaccounted for at Bank of China, while eight brokerage firms are under investigation for the disappearance of RMB 6.4 billion in client funds. Government officials state that corruption levels have not increased suddenly, but that more cases are being uncovered. Investigations into corporate crime have intensified, particularly within state-owned enterprises. Financial irregularities among newly listed companies have impacted investor confidence in China's stock market. The cases at CCB have also raised questions about the bank's planned partial privatization and efforts to attract foreign investment. Regulatory challenges persist in China, where enforcement mechanisms and corporate governance structures remain under development. Some prosecutions have drawn scrutiny over potential political motivations. China's efforts to strengthen corporate oversight currently rely on centralized measures, though many companies lack standardized accountability systems. Analysts note that developing comprehensive business regulations will require further reforms. The stability of China's economic growth may provide time to address these issues. Investment analysts suggest foreign investors carefully assess risks associated with Chinese corporate investments."

        "title": "Colin Cottell examines the translation and interpreting profession",
        "original_text": "Up to £400 a day, a varied workload, and foreign travel thrown in; that's nice work if you can get it in anybody's language. Certainly, as an interpreter and translator specialising in Russian, Neil Keenan is not complaining. \"I love my job,\" says Mr Keenan, 33, from Bristol. He has benefited from the growth of the Russian economy, and the expansion of the EU, which has brought many Russian-speakers from the Baltic States to the UK. However, despite the evident satisfaction of Mr Keenan for a job which can see him attending a big international conference one day, and interpreting at a police station or working in the courts, the next, Britain's traditional indifference to learning languages - and employing linguists - means many opportunities are missed. There's no shortage of work, says Mr Bowden, general secretary of the Association of Translation Companies. The courts, police and local authorities all need skilled linguists to serve clients who speak a wide range of languages. \"The average NHS Trust may need to communicate with people in up to 50 languages,\" he says. Telephone interpreting and localisation, where, say, promotional material is translated into the language of the local market are particular growth areas. \"There is a growing need for English native speakers to translate into English,\" says Christina Schaffner, from the School of Languages and Social Sciences at Aston University, which has been running an undergraduate degree course in translating and interpreting since 1997. So what is the problem? According to Mr Bowden, while demand is growing, there are question marks over whether home-grown talent can take advantage of the opportunities. \"The ability to recruit British-born interpreters is being hampered by short-term government polices,\" says Mr Bowden. In particular, allowing youngsters to opt out of studying foreign languages at age 14 \"sends out all the wrong messages\". Mr Bowden continues: \"As long as people grow up to think that it is okay just to speak English, they will be unlikely to take up language courses and see translating as an option.\" Alan Wheatley, general secretary of the Institute of Translation &amp; Interpreting (the ITI) says that something needs to be done to attract people into an industry employing 15,000-20,000 people, and estimated to be worth up to £600m a year. \"There are not enough people taking languages courses and becoming linguists,\" he says. \"Unless we get more into the industry, there will be a shortfall within the next five to 10 years.\" Only last month, Digby Jones, director general of the employers' organisation, the CBI, bemoaned the drop in the number of students taking a foreign language at A Level since 1999. However, many believe that our own well-known aversion to foreign languages, combined with an attitude which says \"Oh well, if foreigners are happy to learn English, why should we bother?\" spells trouble. Even Mr Keenan admits that he succeeded despite the system, and not because of it. \"The way foreign languages were put across was, when you go on holiday you will be able to order food. It is not seen as a career. Translating and interpreting was never listed an an option,\" he says. As a result, Mr Keenan says, he only became an interpreter \"by accident\" after \"six years living in a communal flat full of Russians, none of whom spoke English\". This allowed him to complete two post-graduate courses when he returned home to the UK. However, according to Mr Wheatley the problems go even wider. Why is it, he asks, that even language students often fail to end up as interpreters and translators? It's because of the attitude of employers, he says. \"They need to understand that interpreting and translating is a profession and that they need professionals and not someone who speaks holiday Spanish.\" Using a \"well-meaning individual who knows the language\" is no substitute for a professional. Until they recognise that, \"they will not attract youngsters into the business,\" he argues. Lack of career progression is another factor. It is only possible if there are employers who are prepared to offer a language-based career. But this is simply not happening, he says, pointing to a trend for companies to outsource work and close down their in-house language departments. All this helps to explain why 90% of those in the industry are freelance, and why interpreting and translating are unlikely to be \"careers of choice\", he says. Peter Bennett, chief executive officer of London Translations, a translation and interpreting agency, says that the industry suffers from a lack of regulation and common standards. People just arrived from Eastern Europe think it is \"easy money\" in comparison to, say, being a cleaning lady. And because they will work for virtually nothing, some people will take them on. Mr Bennett says: \"It is increasingly difficult to find English mother tongue interpreters and translators. More are coming from abroad.\" In the case of his own company, he says, the number of interpreters and translators on his books with English as their mother tongue has dropped to around 40%. According to Mr Bennett, even those we are teaching are studying the wrong languages. Not enough people are being trained in Chinese and Korean, where demand is growing. Another factor is increasing competition from India, China, and South America, where the use of technology such as the internet, and lower wages, means that work can be done much more cheaply than in the UK. \"The translation industry is quite literally going south,\" he says. So does this mean that despite growing demand worldwide, career prospects in the UK are poor? Not necessarily, says Mr Bennett. While the future for interpreters is \"more rosy\" than for translators, because UK workers score well on the \"softer skills\" required in interpreting, there are things both can do to improve their marketability and enhance their careers. \"You need something else when you are competing with people who are selling language as a commodity. And the way around it is to have another skill. What else can you do? It might be marketing, or being a doctor.\" As for career progression, while he admits, \"this is not as formal as in most professions, there is a way up the value chain\". Mr Bennett says: \"Typically, you start off as a proof reader or checker, then become a senior translator. If you have trained, say as a lawyer, you could become a legal translator, or if you get really good, as a localisation consultant re-writing documents for a local market. It is the other skills that allow you to progress. \"Someone who does French at university for four years - they will be competing with someone in China, where they can do it so much cheaper. However, what the person in China won't have is a chemical engineering or a manufacturing qualification, and industry experience. \"I would want someone to do a language, along with say, marketing, and then go out and work in that country to get the credibility. The client wants to know you have that experience.\" Only around 5,000 of those working in the industry are qualified interpreters or translators, says the ITI's Mr Wheatley. So it is a good career move, to do a recognised qualification with one of the professional institutes.",
        "debiased_text": "Neil Keenan, a 33-year-old interpreter and translator specializing in Russian from Bristol, has seen professional opportunities due to the growth of the Russian economy and EU expansion, which has brought Russian-speaking individuals from the Baltic States to the UK. His work involves a range of assignments, from international conferences to legal settings. However, broader trends indicate that the UK has historically placed limited emphasis on language learning and the employment of linguists, potentially missing economic opportunities. According to the Association of Translation Companies, demand for skilled linguists remains high in sectors such as courts, police, and local authorities, with the NHS sometimes requiring communication in up to 50 languages. Telephone interpreting and localization—such as the translation of promotional materials for local markets—are growing fields. Christina Schaffner of Aston University notes an increasing need for native English speakers to translate into English. Despite rising demand, concerns exist about the UK's capacity to meet these needs domestically. The Association of Translation Companies cites short-term government policies, including the option for students to stop studying foreign languages at age 14, as potential obstacles. The Institute of Translation & Interpreting (ITI) has highlighted that the industry, valued at an estimated £600 million annually and employing 15,000–20,000 people, requires efforts to attract more entrants. Recent data shows a decline in A Level language students since 1999. Alan Wheatley of the ITI and Peter Bennett of London Translations note additional industry challenges, including a reliance on freelancers, competition from lower-wage countries, and a lack of standardized qualifications. Bennett emphasizes the importance of combining language skills with other professional expertise, such as law or marketing, to enhance employability. The ITI reports that around 5,000 industry professionals hold formal qualifications, suggesting that recognized certifications may benefit career prospects."

        "original_text": "BEIJING -- Washington wants to start a dialogue with Beijing to avert a damaging trade war over China's cheap steel exports -- and also continues to push for tougher intellectual-property-rights protection to ease a record trade deficit, a U.S. trade official said. Undersecretary for International Trade Franklin Lavin said he met with top Chinese trade and economic-policy officials over three days this week to push China to drop trade barriers. The U.S. also is asking China to toughen its antipiracy measures, which U.S. businesses say are lax and hurt their exports to China. Mr. Lavin predicted growing political tension between the U.S. and China when the U.S. government releases 2005 trade figures in February showing the bilateral trade deficit at about $200 billion. \"We're potentially in for some bad news commercially and politically,\" he said. The deficit is likely to be $40 billion more than last year's $162 billion trade deficit, also a record. \"If they stem from unfair trading practices, or even the perception of unfair trading practices, then commercial problems translate into political problems,\" Mr. Lavin said. Mr. Lavin said U.S. exports to China could grow another 25% if barriers were lifted. They currently total about $40 billion a year, he said. Particularly hard hit by cheap Chinese exports have been the U.S. steelmakers. China is the world's biggest producer and consumer of steel and is likely to make a record 350 million tons of steel this year, despite government efforts to curb overcapacity and oversupply in the sector. China has been exporting its surplus, forcing down prices in Japan, South Korea and the U.S. China's steel exports to the U.S. doubled to 1.6 million tons in the first eight months of the year, compared with the same period a year earlier. Mr. Lavin said the U.S. has offered to start talks on the steel industry under the auspices of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, part of the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, which is already looking at ways to better enforce intellectual-property rights. \"We'd like to have some discussion on these issues and not simply wait until one side files a trade remedy action,\" Mr. Lavin said. A spokesman from China's Ministry of Commerce said he hadn't heard of the approach. Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said he was unaware of the details of the proposal but said China welcomed such dialogue to encourage the development of trade. The U.S. has previously threatened tough measures to protect its domestic steel industry. The Department of Commerce has already initiated an antidumping investigation into Chinese imports to the U.S. of alloy steel rod wire. The U.S. total trade gap has widened this year, in part because of the surging price of energy imports, while bilateral trade with China has grown rapidly. About 60% of China's exports, though, are being made by companies that are all or partly owned by international firms, including many U.S. companies that manufacture in China. Exports boost gross domestic product, while imports subtract from it.",

A few admitted to choosing inexpensive design elements for their own homes and shopping at TJ Maxx. While each designer highlights something unique, they are all based on the same ideals: making the most of what you already have and using accessories shrewdly. Here are a few of the designers' suggestions.\nAccentuate\n\"I just changed all the knobs in my otherwise plain kitchen to red coral ones I found at Anthropologie [set of two, $12]. There is no quicker, easier update in a kitchen than changing out the knobs; why not have a 'summer' and a 'winter'?\" -- Mark Cutler\n--\n\"Simply add three to five boldly patterned, bright accent pillows and a coordinating throw to any living room or bedroom, and voila -- your room will be transformed in no time and with minimal cost. Be adventurous in your pillow selections. You can always swap them out. Or invest in a recognizable design piece from a store like DWR and make it conspicuous. Then, take a trip to IKEA and pick up some design-oriented pieces at great prices. The blend will create a high- end aesthetic at a reasonable price. This mix-and-match concept is a favorite of mine as well as other famous designers such as Philippe Starck.\" -- Velvet Hammerschmidt\n--\n\"If you're on a budget, the best way to customize a lighting fixture is to find fabric, paper or wallpaper from a remnant store and take it to Fantasy Lighting on Melrose. For under $100, they can make a lampshade with whatever fabric or wallpaper you provide them with. Then, get one of those cord kits from IKEA and customize your own chandelier out of the lampshade. That's a really inexpensive way to change the look of your dining room for seasons or whatever event you're planning.\" -- Kenneth Brown\n--\n\"I'm always at Cost Plus, Ross, Rolling Greens floral supply, TJ Maxx and Tuesday Morning for pillows, vases, sheets, kitchen canisters, trays for the bathroom. Take a sushi tray from Cost Plus and put three slices of soap from Lush on it for your bathroom. They always have great china and barware at TJ Maxx. The trick is to mix it in with really good antiques. I bought glass vases from TJ Maxx and made them into lamps, and they look like Murano. For bookshelves, I like to mix in ceramics and family pictures and art books. You want things to pop. You will know if it's too cheap to put in your house: too shiny, too fake, animals on it, flowers or the scale is wrong.\" -- Sasha Emerson\n--\nRe-purpose\n\"I have a wooden frame sofa that has been through at least six changes, from black trim with black-and-white fabric, with lime green throw pillows, to yellow with a yellow print fabric to gray with silver accents, depending on the decade and the room. Each time, with new paint and fabric, the old sofa took on a fresh, new look. When the furniture has a classic frame, a new finish and a different fabric creates an entirely different look. I took an old dining room table, had it cut in two, and now use them as console tables in the living room. A chest of drawers can become a living room sofa back table. An antique bookcase can be recessed into a bedroom closet as an entertainment center.\" -- Lee Mink\n--\nSmart storage\n\"A storage cylinder for pantry goods is efficient and inexpensive. The rotating cylinder allows your pantry items to be accessed right at your fingertips. Along with its function, the storage cylinder acts as a free-standing furniture piece, which creates visual relief from the rest of the kitchen's base and upper cabinetry.\" -- Troy Adams",

        "title": "Timothy Garton Ash: Blair should be listening EU president",
        "original_text": "According to France's foreign minister, the British foreign secretary is guilty of perpetrating a supercherie. This does not mean that Jack Straw has outdone Cherie Blair in whatever it is to be a Cherie. It means \"a piece of trickery\". Meanwhile, the French prime minister Dominique de Villepin told his parliament that \"this British cheque [ie Britain's EU budget rebate] - and I say this with all the friendship I feel for the British people [people, note, not government] - is truly an expense from the ançien régime\". Coming from an unelected French aristocrat, that might be considered the pot calling the kettle black. With friends like these, who needs enemies? In the immediate run-up to the Iraq war, Tony Blair seized upon a remark made by Jacques Chirac to blame on France our failure to get a second UN resolution. By pointing the finger at Britain's ancient \"sweet enemy\", he just managed to win the Commons vote for war. In the aftermath of the French no vote on the constitutional treaty, Jacques Chirac has deftly shifted the spotlight on to the British budget rebate, so he can blame Europe's crisis on perfidious Albion rather than France. Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose . Well, I have news for leaders on both sides of the Channel: we are living in the 21st century, not the 14th. This needle match between France and Britain dates back at least to the hundred years war. It is probably the oldest continuous national rivalry in the world, with the possible exception of that between China and Japan. It has now become ridiculous, damaging, demeaning and pathetic. When they now talk bitterly of \"national egoism\", new members of the European Union mean both Britain and France - the two countries that used to be, for them, the model of what it is to be a \"normal\" European country. The Bush administration in Washington, which has belatedly and tentatively held out a hand of partnership to the EU, watches with dismay, tinged with contempt. To respond to the greatest crisis of popular confidence in the European project for 50 years by having a Franco-British row over money is like a couple reacting to the complete trashing of their house in a flash flood by bickering over who does the ironing. In the long run, as I have argued for some time, the only way forward, not just for us but for the whole of Europe, is for these two ancient rivals to find a historical compromise on the key issues that divide them: transatlantic relations, approaches to economic and social reform, the constitutional nature of the EU, enlargement. But that requires time. First, this autumn, Angela Merkel has to replace Gerhard Schröder as German chancellor, so that Germany can return to its proper role as honest broker between Paris and London. Then, in May 2007, Jacques Chirac has to be replaced by another French president. For with Chirac, the Louis XVI of European politics, such a compromise is impossible. By that time, however, the British prime minister may be called Gordon Brown; or, at the very least, Tony Blair will be thinking hard about his future on the lecture circuit as, so to speak, a Super-Cherie. Meanwhile, Britain has the presidency of the European Union for the next six months. Britain's two prime ministers are setting out their stalls. The prime minister in office will do so in an address to the European parliament today. The prime minister in waiting, Gordon Brown, did so in his Mansion House speech last night. To judge by what I have seen so far, I'm afraid they will get it wrong - less in content than in tone. But tone is all-important in such a moment. Blair and Brown now face a triple challenge. First, Chirac's exercise in buck-passing and Blair's intransigence (\"Thatcher in a suit\") have been damaging to Britain's reputation with many of its European partners. The prime minister of Luxembourg, who presided over the failed EU summit, yesterday launched a bitter attack on the British position. Even in countries broadly favourable to Blairism, such as Poland, Britain is seen as behaving like a selfish rich country. When British voices advance their vision of \"Forward to a competitive future\", what many in continental Europe hear is \"Back to a free-trade zone\". Second, what the peoples of Europe have been saying through these no votes is \"We want you, the leaders, to listen to us\". They are in no mood to be lectured to. Third, British Eurosceptics have got the wind in their sails, and are now talking about a fundamental rethink of the whole European project. The political editor of the Sun, Trevor Kavanagh, praises Blair for his row with Chirac, declaring that the prime minister has \"emerged as a full-blown Eurosceptic\". In this tricky corner, the language and tone adopted by Blair, Brown, Straw and others is critical. On the continent, they are talking to a deeply disaffected audience, many of whom believe both that the European Union has gone wrong and that Britain is not truly committed to any larger vision of the European project; would rather go back to a glorified free-trade area; would always choose America over Europe; really prefers American-style free-market solutions; and isn't doing half as well as it thinks it is economically. They can find serious Brits to support each of those propositions - although not the same person for them all. Peter Mandelson says that we should turn the French and Dutch no votes into a yes to a New Europe. New Labour, New Europe. There was a time when such a message might have fallen on receptive ears. That time was in the first years after Blair was first elected; not now. In his Mansion House speech, Gordon Brown performed a familiar act. He recited the economic achievements of the Blair-Brown government. Then he produced a dour list of the things that Europe must do if it is to meet the challenges of globalisation. There's some truth in that, but as an exercise in political persuasion this will get us nowhere. So now it's back to Tony, the great communicator. What should he say to the European parliament? I think he should say that the great challenges to Europe do indeed lie outside our frontiers, not in the minutiae of our institutions. Call it \"globalisation\" if you will, but then say what you mean. I think he should say that, in our collective attempt to \"give back to our social model the reality that it has lost\", to use the telling phrase of Nicolas Sarkozy, all European countries have something to contribute. Germany's technical education is still second to none. France's public transport is superb. Scandinavia has shown us the way with primary education. Oh yes, and maybe Britain's experience in freeing up labour markets has something to offer, too (tip: avoid at all costs the word \"liberalisation\"). So let us use these six months to work out how we should go forward, together drawing on the best of each national experience. In business they call it benchmarking. Above all, he should say: read my ears. Now we need the listening presidency. www.freeworldweb.net",

        "original_text": "Intuitive authoritarian; But Chinese president cannot stop the change happening on all fronts\nThe most important person in the world right now might be Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, and we're beginning to get a better sense of what kind of a leader he is: disappointing.\nMore than anyone else, Hu will determine whether China can continue to surge and whether its rise will be stable and peaceful. Ever since he vaulted into the top ranks of the Communist Party in 1992, there have been vigorous debates about whether he is a closet reformer or a closet hard-liner, but now that he has been the Communist leader for 21/2 years, we can form a tentative conclusion: The second camp seems to have been right.\nHu appears to be an intuitive authoritarian who believes in augmenting the tools of repression, not easing them. Most distressing, Hu has tugged China backward politically. He has presided over a steady crackdown on dissent, the news media, religion, Internet commentary and think tanks. China now imprisons far more journalists than any other country.\nAt the New York Times, we've seen this crackdown firsthand. Zhao Yan, a colleague who works for the Times bureau in Beijing, was seized last September and tossed into prison. Why? We don't know for sure, because Zhao has never been tried and neither his lawyer nor his family members have even been allowed to see him.\nLikewise, the bravest and boldest Chinese newspaper used to be Nanfang Dushi Bao. But then the paper reported the police had beaten a university student to death because he wasn't carrying his ID. Two staff members were sent to prison last year for long terms, and China's newspapers are now more docile.\nHu also has a knack for using old-style propaganda phrases that make him sound like a time capsule from a more Communist past. And Chinese intellectuals were horrified when Hu issued an internal statement saying while North Korea had made economic mistakes, it had the right ideas politically.\nStill, Hu's clampdown has had only a limited effect, because China is now too porous and complex for anybody to control very successfully. Ordinary people are hiring lawyers to enforce their rights, and the rule of law is steadily painting the party leaders into a corner.\n\"They can't control everything anymore,\" said a Chinese with long connections to the country's leaders. \"They're like a fire brigade, rushing around to put out the fires that burn hottest, and leaving the others alone.\"\nIn any case, while Hu is a big disappointment in his political vision, he is turning out to be more solid in other areas, like foreign policy. Hu has done a good job managing foreign relations with other countries, aside from Japan and Sudan, and he has engaged North Korea more meaningfully on the nuclear issue than his predecessors did. Hu has at least managed to work out a coherent policy toward North Korea, which the Bush administration has yet to do.\nHu's economic instincts run to central planning, but he is also pragmatic. And he has a personal stake in a capitalist future: His only daughter, Hu Haiqing, has experience in the high-tech business world and is married to a Stanford-educated Internet tycoon, Daniel Mao.\nPerhaps Hu's most important step has been to begin to address rural poverty and environmental problems, rather than focusing solely on economic growth and new market reforms to achieve it. This shift to more balanced growth is smart and long overdue.\nAt the same time, the pace of economic reform has also stalled, and the giddy expectation that major new reforms are on the way has gone. If this pause is a chance for China to catch its breath, that would be fine - but it looks like more than that.\nHu's basic problem is that he is trying to achieve stability by keeping the lid sealed tight on the pressure cooker. But the lesson of Taiwan and South Korea is the need to expand freedoms to provide outlets for those pressures. Otherwise, as Ukraine and Indonesia showed, pressure cookers can explode.\nSo Hu's emphasis on short-term stability might ultimately be increasing the risks of major instability in China down the road. And in that sense, the victims of Hu's crackdown are not just the individuals sitting in jail, but the entire Chinese people.",
        "debiased_text": "Chinese President Hu Jintao has led the country for two and a half years, during which time various policies and actions have been observed. Under his leadership, there have been increased restrictions on dissent, media outlets, religious groups, online discourse, and policy research organizations. China currently detains more journalists than any other nation.\n\nOne case involves Zhao Yan, a Beijing-based employee of The New York Times, who was detained in September without public trial or access to legal representatives and family. Similarly, Nanfang Dushi Bao newspaper previously published reports about police conduct but later saw two staff members receive long prison sentences, resulting in increased media caution nationwide.\n\nIn foreign policy matters, Hu has maintained relations with various countries while showing particular engagement with North Korea regarding nuclear discussions. Domestically, his administration has shifted policy focus to include rural development and environmental concerns alongside economic growth measures.\n\nEconomic reforms have slowed under Hu's administration. The president's daughter has connections to the technology sector through both her career and marriage to an internet entrepreneur.\n\nAnalysis suggests that current governance approaches focus on maintaining stability through control measures, while comparisons are drawn with other Asian nations that pursued different developmental paths involving expanded civil liberties. Observers note the potential long-term effects of these governance strategies on societal stability."

        "original_text": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday July 1 2005 It was unclear from the piece below on literature in translation that Harvill has, since 1991, published eight of the novels of International Man Booker prizewinner Ismail Kadare. Britain's literary scene is so parochial that there is virtually a conspiracy against readers experiencing the best of the world's literature, according to John Carey, the chairman of the judges for the first International Man Booker prize. Dr Carey said foreign literature was \"neglected\" in the UK, and to an outsider the British publishing industry could \"seem like a conspiracy intent on depriving ... readers of the majority of the good books written in languages other than their own\". If such laxity had applied 50 or 60 years ago, \"that would have meant, for the English reader, no Kafka, no Camus, no Calvino, no Borges,\" he said. Dr Carey, a former professor of English at Oxford, was speaking in Edinburgh last night at a ceremony at which the Albanian writer Ismail Kadare was given the £60,000 prize. Other shortlisted writers included Margaret Atwood, Muriel Spark and Ian McEwan. Dr Carey said: \"If you speak Spanish or French or Italian or German or any of a dozen other languages, and walk into your local bookstore, you will ... find what is being imagined in China, what stories are being told in Korea, how the novel is being reinvented in Spain and the Scandinavian countries. But if you live in England you will find no such abundance.\" But Jamie Byng, of the publishing house Canongate, which is putting out Kadare's new novels as well as some of his back catalogue, said: \"To level those charges entirely at publishers shows a real naivety about what it takes to get books published; it is not fair or right. [The lack of literature in translation] is also partly to do with booksellers, and partly with a resistance among readers ... We've published books translated from at least 20 languages and it's not easy. The act of translation itself is very difficult: it is almost as demanding as writing a book from scratch.\" Mr Byng also said English had a \"worrying stranglehold\" in all areas of culture. Peter Ayrton, publisher at Serpent's Tail, which has also published novels by Kadare, pointed to a \"cultural chauvinism\" throughout British culture and said that literary editors commissioned few reviews of translated books. \"English is such a dominant language it is easier, when publishers want to do foreign literature, to publish American, Indian, Canadian, African books written in English,\" he said. Christopher MacLehose, for 20 years publisher at Harvill, said that the quantitative difference between British and, for example, French translated books was \"humiliatingly large\", with about 3% of books on the UK market being translations, compared with about 23% of French.",

        "original_text": "(From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) By Kathy Chen BEIJING -- China issued new regulations to govern the publication of news stories on the Internet, amid what appears to be an ongoing campaign to clean up the media industry. The Ministry of Information Industry and the State Council Information Office, under China's cabinet, yesterday issued the rules restricting online news services from publishing certain kinds of news. These include stories that jeopardize state security or disclose state secrets; those that destroy the country's unity or hurt the state's reputation and interests; and those that disturb social order and stability. The rules, which were posted on Web site of the official Xinhua news agency, prohibit the posting of news containing pornography, fabricated information or violence. According to Xinhua, any Web sites that violate the rules could face severe punishment, including being shut down. The rules come amid what appears to be a larger clean-up campaign of the media industry. In the last few years, both domestic and foreign media organizations have scrambled to gain a bigger slice of China's expanding media market. As Chinese media begin to put profit over propaganda, many have sought to attract readers with news scoops as well as titillating stories, not all of them accurate. Some foreign companies, such as Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., have pushed the envelope on regulations to gain a wider audience for their content. At the same time, the increasing boldness of the Chinese media is creating headaches for Chinese officials. Chinese media often break stories on disasters and corruption cases that in the past were rarely reported by the media, which traditionally played the role of the \"throat and tongue\" of the Communist Party. Regulators have in recent months tightened the reins on Chinese media organizations, including reshuffling management at newspapers seen as failing to toe the official line and calling Chinese reporters on their cell phones to warn them against reporting certain news. They have begun an investigation into some of News Corp.'s practices in China. New Corp. has said it would work within China's regulatory framework but has declined to comment on an investigation into some of its practices. The new rules require that any Chinese organizations seeking to set up online news services joint ventures with foreign partners must get permission from the State Council Information Office. Any nonmedia organization that republishes news online or offers news through cell phone services must have at least 10 full-time news or editorial staff, half of whom must have at least three years of news experience, the rules said. --- Cui Rong contributed to this article.",

        "original_text": "With Alexandra A. Seno in Hong Kong and Ralph Jennings and Quindlen Krovatin in Beijing Nobody in Zhang Rong's village in coastal China knows much about the danger of a bird-flu pandemic. The 37-year-old farmer has enough to worry about. A nearby business park wants to take over her mushroom farm. Neighbors are dying of untreated cancers that some believe came from eating pesticide-tainted produce. One tenth of the family's annual income is spent on medical expenses, including sending Zhang's two kids to a public hospital when they get sick. Much of that cash goes into so-called red envelopes--bribes--for doctors who otherwise prescribe expensive medicines in retaliation for not getting a \"gift.\" Few of the 4,000 villagers have medical insurance. \"The government doesn't pay for a thing,\" she gripes. Ask about bird flu and Zhang tosses out a chilling wish: \"I hope bird flu ravages China--to prove to the leadership what's wrong with health care in the countryside.\" Zhang may be closer to getting her apocalyptic wish. Bird-flu jitters are spreading worldwide, as the tempo of new cases continues to escalate. Last Wednesday, in China's first reported H5N1 outbreak in months, mainland authorities revealed bird flu had killed 2,600 birds on a poultry farm in the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia, less than a day's drive from Zhang's home. Taiwanese authorities discovered the H5N1 virus among exotic fowl on a ship from mainland China. Suspected cases have emerged from Moscow to Macedonia. As health officials gird for what some scientists fear could eventually turn into a global health crisis, one of the weakest links in the world's defenses is China's tattered health-care system. Many experts think China could be the epicenter of any bird-flu pandemic. Indeed, China has ideal conditions for fostering a new human flu pathogen. On top of China's 1.3 billion people, it also has 14 billion poultry and 70 percent of the world's wild waterfowl coming to visit, says Dr. Julie Hall, a WHO representative in Beijing. It also has half the world's pigs, which tend to harbor human viruses that can combine with bird-flu bugs to form human pathogens. Although Beijing said last week that it would close its borders if a mutated version of H5N1 infected humans, experts fear that the virus would slip through China's surveillance system in the first crucial weeks and quickly overwhelm its health-care system. \"In big cities, control is good, but in remote areas, maybe not,\" says Christine Liu of Taiwan's CDC. \"There's nobody to take samples, nobody to test the samples.\" During the SARS epidemic two years ago, China took a lot of heat from health officials for its slow response and secrecy. Beijing instituted reforms in its hospital system that led to greater transparency and speed in reporting outbreaks. But these reforms haven't trickled down to all the provinces. SARS reporting took place mainly at the hospitals, where doctors would observe the number of patients who came in with fever and other symptoms, and pass that information to Beijing. In health-department surveys during the summer, nearly a third of Chinese said they don't go to the hospital when they need to, and half avoid seeing a doctor. A big problem is a collapse in China's social safety net. Once upon a time, the country took care of its citizens' health care from cradle to grave. Chinese were poor, but Mao's policies were egalitarian. Back then, Maoist \"people's communes\" handled everything from providing medical services to transporting harvested crops to the state. But market reforms launched in the 1980s dismantled the communes and allowed family farmers to sell their own crops for a profit. Peasant incomes surged but nothing replaced the health-care void. Although three quarters of China's 1.3 billion people live in rural areas, virtually none of them has medical insurance. Even in cities, quality health care is often a privilege of the wealthy. \"The present reform of the medical and health system is basically not successful,\" says Ge Yanfeng, a senior official at a State Council think tank who contributed to a recently released critique of the post-Mao public-health system. \"It's run into a dead end.\" Chinese complain of soaring prices, bad service and rip-offs in the health system. Today doctors chase kickbacks and wealthy patients. Weaned from government subsidies, hospitals hike prices to survive the marketplace. Corruption is rife because the rising costs of drugs and overhead means fees charged at traditionally low rates cannot help make ends meet. These problems leave China's health-care system highly vulnerable to a flu pandemic. According to officials at the World Health Organization, to avert a pandemic that begins in China the government's surveillance system would have to detect an outbreak before it is able to infect more than 20 people, and no more than three weeks have passed since exposure. With numbers higher than this, the virus is likely to spread too far for quarantines and antiviral treatments to be effective. Meanwhile many poor Chinese simply don't bother with hospitals until they're virtually at death's door. And that requires a shift in China's hospital-based surveillance system, says Hall: \"Things have improved, but we need to get surveillance mechanisms out into the community, by tracking school absenteeism or drug sales. It's a huge challenge.\" Beijing has been particularly slow to resolve the turf battles and lack of coordination between ministries and departments. Right now, the hidebound Agriculture Ministry is in charge because the virus is killing poultry. When it attacks humans, the Health Ministry will take the lead. But in the meantime nobody's held responsible for scrutinizing that crucial point of bird-to-human transmission. Beijing also needs to be more forward-leaning in its public education. Chinese leaders are so obsessed with maintaining social order that they may opt to sacrifice transparency for the sake of keeping citizens blissfully in the dark. That may be far too high a price to pay.",

A nearby business park plans to acquire her mushroom farm. Some neighbors have died from untreated cancers, which some attribute to consuming produce with pesticide residues. Medical expenses account for one-tenth of her family’s annual income, including treatments for her two children at a public hospital. Payments sometimes include unofficial fees to doctors. Few of the village’s 4,000 residents have medical insurance. When asked about bird flu, Zhang expressed frustration with rural healthcare. Recent developments indicate growing concerns about bird flu globally. Last Wednesday, Chinese authorities reported an H5N1 outbreak in Inner Mongolia, where 2,600 birds died on a poultry farm. Taiwanese officials detected the virus in birds imported from mainland China. Suspected cases have been reported from Moscow to Macedonia. Health experts are monitoring the situation due to concerns about a potential global health crisis. China’s healthcare system faces challenges in addressing such outbreaks, particularly in rural areas. According to Dr. Julie Hall of the WHO, China has a large population, significant poultry numbers, and migratory waterfowl, which could contribute to virus transmission. Pigs, which are also abundant in China, can host viruses that may combine with bird flu strains. While China has announced border closures if H5N1 mutates to infect humans, experts worry about delays in detection and strain on healthcare resources. During the SARS outbreak, China improved hospital reporting systems, but gaps remain in rural areas. Surveys indicate many Chinese avoid hospitals due to costs and accessibility issues. China’s healthcare system underwent changes after market reforms in the 1980s, shifting from state-provided care to a fee-based model, leaving many without insurance. A State Council report described healthcare reforms as struggling. Rising costs and corruption have further strained the system. WHO officials note that early detection is critical to containing a potential pandemic. Current surveillance in China relies on hospitals, but tracking community-level indicators like school absences or drug sales could improve response efforts. Coordination between government departments, such as the Agriculture and Health Ministries, remains a challenge. Public education efforts are also needed to ensure transparency and awareness."

        "title": "China faces prospect of sustained decline in coal production SAFETY ISSUES IN SHANXI: [LONDON 1ST EDITION]; China faces prospect of sustained decline in coal production SAFETY ISSUES IN SHANXI:   [LONDON 1ST EDITION ]",
        "original_text": "Steam coal producers around the world are intrigued by the recent fall in coal production in Shanxi, China's key coal producing province. Production of steam coal, which is burned to produce electricity, fell by 25.2 million tonnes to 139.8mt between January and May after years of growth. The question is whether Chinese steam coal exports, which have been stable at about 71m-73m tonnes for the past two years, are about to go into a sustained decline. China's exports for the first five months fell to 30.8mt, down 6.4mt from the same period last year. (The figures cover all coal exports, including small volumes of coking coal and anthracite). At the same time, Chinese steam coal imports are rising, nearly doubling to 4.9mt in the first four months of the year, mainly to southern and coastal provinces. In Guangdong province, the Guangdong economic and trade commission wants increased supplies to ensure it does not suffer the same fate as last summer when stocks fell to just two to three days of usage. Were the decline in Shanxi's production to continue, it would come as a relief to China's competitors in the Asia-Pacific region - Australia and Indonesia - because prices have been under pressure recently. Although a far cry from prices at the depth of the market a couple of years ago, Newcastle prices of just under Dollars 52 a tonne are Dollars 10 lower than in June last year. But there are reasons to suspect that Shanxi's production cuts are not quite what they seem. The province has suffered from a series of accidents, and the government has wanted to be seen taking action to stem the flow of well-publicised fatalities. Around the coal centre of Datong, in northern Shanxi, the government forced the small township mines to close and reined in the output of the bigger mines that had been producing above officially set targets. Over 55 per cent of the mines are still closed and awaiting certificates to reopen. Guangdong's situation might not be typical either, because coal stocks are rising and the amount of coal being burned is falling elsewhere in China. In addition, stocks at major ports were 14.8mt at the end of May, up 64 per cent on levels from the previous year. For a country that produces nearly 2bn tonnes, these stock levels are minimal. But the combination of a drop in coal burn and rising stocks at ports, mines and power stations might have prompted the coal authorities to act now on Shanxi production levels because the impact on markets would be minimal. There are rumours among some exporting companies that China might issue additional export licences to help deal with a looming oversupply of steam coal. Should this be the case, producer celebration at reports of Shanxi's production problems may be short- lived. The Chinese coal industry faces many challenges, but the twin ones of safety and of being able to enforce a reasonable percentage of extraction from its immense coal wealth appear to be the main ones. Record price levels for both coking coal and steam coal have seen many mine operators \"high grade\" their reserves, meaning they take out the easily mined material and in the process wreck the overall value of the resource. One answer would be to replace many of the smaller, privately owned mines in Shanxi with much bigger state or provincial-owned operations.",
        "debiased_text": "Steam coal production in Shanxi, China's major coal-producing province, declined by 25.2 million tonnes to 139.8 million tonnes between January and May, following years of growth. China's coal exports for the first five months decreased to 30.8 million tonnes, a reduction of 6.4 million tonnes compared to the same period last year. These figures include all coal exports, such as coking coal and anthracite in smaller quantities. Meanwhile, Chinese steam coal imports nearly doubled to 4.9 million tonnes in the first four months of the year, primarily directed toward southern and coastal provinces like Guangdong. The Guangdong Economic and Trade Commission has sought increased supplies to avoid stock shortages similar to those experienced last summer, when reserves dropped to two or three days of usage. A prolonged decline in Shanxi's production could potentially affect coal prices in the Asia-Pacific region, where competitors like Australia and Indonesia operate. Newcastle prices currently stand at just under $52 per tonne, $10 lower than in June of the previous year. Shanxi's production cuts may be influenced by government efforts to improve mine safety following accidents, including the closure of small township mines near Datong and restrictions on larger mines exceeding production targets. Approximately 55% of mines remain closed pending recertification. Nationally, coal stocks at major ports reached 14.8 million tonnes by the end of May, a 64% increase year-on-year, while coal consumption has decreased in some regions. Speculation exists that additional export licenses might be issued to address potential oversupply. Broader industry challenges include mine safety and sustainable extraction practices, with some operators prioritizing easily accessible coal seams, potentially diminishing long-term resource value. Proposals to consolidate smaller private mines into larger state-owned operations have been suggested as a possible solution."

        "original_text": "BEIJING -- China rejected Japanese demands that it stop drilling for disputed undersea gas resources, but in a hint of progress amid rocky bilateral relations, the two sides agreed to further discussions. Following two days of talks, Japanese officials said yesterday that while Beijing refused to suspend work on disputed gas fields in the East China Sea, the Chinese proposed that the two sides jointly explore for gas in the vicinity. The two sides will have another round of talks in Japan, the officials said. Few believe that China and Japan are anywhere close to resolving their dispute over territory and resources in the East China Sea. But some foreign-policy experts said this week's talks featured a rare indication of some progress in a relationship that has deteriorated sharply in recent months. \"The best result I could have expected was that the dispute didn't intensify,\" said Shi Yinhong, a foreign-policy expert at People's University in Beijing. \"The two countries basically differ on every aspect of the matter; the only consensus left between the countries is that they need to have talks.\" A series of sometimes violent anti-Japan demonstrations recently swept major Chinese cities, as thousands of people took to the streets to protest Japanese officials' visits to a Tokyo shrine that commemorates war dead, including convicted war criminals, as well as Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. Tensions flared again early last week when Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi, during a visit to Tokyo, abruptly canceled a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and left the country, apparently to express displeasure over Mr. Koizumi's comments about visits to the Tokyo shrine. At the heart of the East China Sea dispute is a disagreement over where to draw the line that divides the two sides' declared zones of economic control. Japan says the boundary should be halfway between it and China. China says its zone of control should encompass the continental shelf, effectively pushing the line closer to Japan. The problem moved from abstract to concrete a year ago, when China began building offshore platforms to drill for natural gas -- in what Beijing calls the Chunxiao field -- near the edge of the disputed area. While the rigs, which stand in open sea north of Taiwan, are in waters that Japan agrees are controlled by China, Tokyo says they are close enough to suck up natural gas from both sides of the disputed line. In April, Tokyo said it was preparing to issue licenses allowing companies to drill seabed in disputed areas, provoking protests by Beijing. Japanese officials also said yesterday that the two sides had agreed to set up a bilateral working group of diplomats and legal experts to discuss the demarcation issue. --- Cui Rong contributed to this article.",

The two countries remain divided over territorial and resource claims in the East China Sea. Some foreign policy analysts noted limited progress in the discussions, though major disagreements persist. A working group involving diplomats and legal experts will be established to address demarcation issues. Recent tensions between China and Japan include anti-Japan protests in Chinese cities, related to Japanese officials' visits to a Tokyo war memorial and Japan's bid for a UN Security Council seat. Separately, Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi canceled a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi during a visit to Tokyo, reportedly due to dissatisfaction over remarks concerning the shrine. The East China Sea dispute centers on differing interpretations of maritime boundaries. Japan advocates a median line, while China bases its claim on the continental shelf. China began drilling near the contested area last year, prompting Japan to consider licensing exploration in disputed zones earlier this year."

        "original_text": "The TUC last night demanded the government hold an emergency summit on the threat to British industry from China as the west's leading thinktank said that European Union countries needed to reform employment practices to meet the threat of globalisation. Providing support for the prime minister's \"reform or die\" message to the EU, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development called on its 30 wealthier members to reform their employment practices urgently to withstand competition from emerging economies. But the TUC said employers are wrong to think that Britain can compete against China by becoming even more of a low-tax, low-regulation economy. The OECD estimated that its 30 member countries will still have about 36 million unemployed in 2006 - about 6.4% of the workforce - on current trends. \"About 35% of people of working age are without a job, and there are few signs of significant improvement in the next two years,\" says its report. Concerns that globalisation will lead to job losses not only in manufacturing but also in the service sector have been fuelled by recent EU enlargement and the rapid growth of the Chinese and Indian economies. The TUC said the way to keep British manufacturing competitive with China was to invest in skills, research and innovation. TUC chief economist Ian Brinkley said: \"While each firm has to make and sell its own products, it is right to ask how government and the [manufacturing] sector can work together to make the changes needed. That is why we need a special summit help focus minds.\" But the OECD said globalisation anxieties were overblown: \"Such concerns are in stark contrast with evidence that past episodes of trade and investment liberalisation have been an important source of rising employment and living standards.\" It does concede the adjustment to the new world order is \"neither painless nor automatic\". It calls on members to reform labour practices so those finding themselves out of work have help to find new jobs while receiving adequate income support. Those working in industrial sectors often find it harder to get new jobs and may have to accept big pay cuts, concludes the OECD report.",
        "debiased_text": "The TUC called for the government to convene an emergency summit regarding the impact of Chinese industry on British manufacturing. Meanwhile, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), based in Paris, recommended that EU countries reform employment practices to adapt to global competition. The OECD urged its 30 member nations to implement labor reforms to remain competitive with emerging economies. The TUC disagreed with the notion that lowering taxes and regulations would help Britain compete with China, advocating instead for investment in skills, research, and innovation. According to OECD projections, its member countries could have approximately 36 million unemployed individuals in 2006, representing 6.4% of the workforce, with little expected improvement in the near term. The expansion of the EU and the growth of China and India have intensified concerns about job losses in both manufacturing and service sectors. TUC chief economist Ian Brinkley emphasized the need for collaboration between government and industry to address these challenges. The OECD noted that fears about globalization are often exaggerated, citing historical evidence that trade and investment liberalization have contributed to employment and living standards. However, it acknowledged that adapting to global economic changes can be difficult, recommending labor reforms to assist displaced workers with job placement and income support. The OECD report highlighted that workers in industrial sectors may face greater challenges in securing new employment and could experience significant wage reductions."

        "original_text": "The fact that most business people in Europe have never heard of Huawei is exactly why the Chinese communications group is interested in Marconi. Huawei grabbed a slice of BT's planned £10bn network refit three months ago, but it has little sales, marketing and servicing capability in Europe. It has been grabbing contracts outside its home market. Over the five years to 2004, it is estimated to have increased overseas sales at a compound 112%. Huawei, based in Shenzhen, was founded in 1988 by Ren Zhengfei, a former officer in the People's Liberation Army. It is not a publicly quoted company and its ownership structure remains unclear, but given its success in securing a favourable $10bn loan (£5.6bn) from the China Development Bank for overseas expansion last year, the assumption among analysts is that the Chinese government has some form of stake. It employs more than 24,000 people, all but 4,000 in China where it is the largest telecommunications equipment maker. In the first half of this year Huawei was awarded contracts worth $4.1bn, up 85% year on year. Management, according to Credit Suisse First Boston, is forecasting overseas sales growing from $2.2bn last year to $10bn by 2008. Of that, Huawei is looking for sales in Europe to top $600m this year, from $200m last year. It made group sales of $3.8bn in 2004. Huawei provides equipment such as wireless systems, including 3G technologies, optical components and internet-based technology. Customers include PCCW, Telecom Egypt, Saudi Telecom, Hutchison Telecom, Telefónica, KPN, China Mobile and China Unicom. It wants to make 3G mobile phone handsets, possibly with Infineon as a chip partner. Under their distribution deal, Huawei uses Marconi's microwave radio technology, developed in Germany, in its wireless network projects; while Marconi resells Huawei's data communications products to its customers. Having suffered initially from western scepticism about the validity of its intellectual property, the company has become a technological powerhouse. As one telecoms insider who has visited Huawei's Shenzhen facility put it: \"They can employ more research and development PhDs per pound than any company in the western world.\" Nevertheless, Huawei needs marketing expertise if it is going to stamp its mark on western communications.",

        "original_text": "The uneasy relationship between the European Union and Beijing is set to be tested today as Jose Manuel Barroso, European Commission president, begins a five-day trip to China. EU officials are fascinated by China's growing economic strength but the relationship has been strained in recent months. \"The EU has just surpassed the US to become China's largest trading partner. And China is our second largest,\" Mr Barroso said on the eve of his visit. \"Our challenge now is to understand China's dramatic re- emergence (and) to learn to work better with this tremendous country.\" But the EU has not granted China either of its key demands. In May last year Wen Jiabao, China's prime minister, visited Brussels to ask for two things: the lifting of the EU's arms embargo on Beijing and for the granting of market economy status, a classification that would make it harder for the EU to impose anti- dumping duties on Chinese goods. A ferocious US lobbying campaign deterred the EU from lifting the embargo, although even diplomats from the UK, Washington's closest ally in the EU, say that the issue will return to the EU agenda, perhaps early next year. The Commission has also insisted that China does not yet meet the criteria to be granted market economy status, which it claims must be awarded on purely technical criteria. But in 2002, in an announcement timed to coincide with an EU- Russia summit, the EU gave market economy status to Russia, a move seen as political since Russia, unlike China, is not a member of the World Trade Organisation. Alan Johnson, UK trade minister, said yesterday he hoped China would be given the status in time for an EU-China summit in September. But the British position is increasingly at odds with that of other EU countries, which have growing concerns about China's fast-growing exports of textiles and other manufactured goods. Last year the EU registered a trade deficit of Euros 78bn (Dollars 95bn, Pounds 54bn) with China, its biggest with any single partner. Total two-way trade was worth Euros 174bn. Unice, the European employers' association, wrote to Mr Barroso this week, urging him not to cede the status to China. Unice said China needed to make progress in financial sector reform and another five areas before it could be granted. Unice also warned against allowing political moti-vations to influence that decision and treating China's application differently from other countries that want to be upgraded to market economy status.",

The EU recently became China's largest trading partner, while China is the EU's second largest trading partner, according to Barroso prior to his trip. During the visit, trade matters are expected to be discussed, including China's requests for the EU to lift its arms embargo and grant market economy status, which would affect anti-dumping measures on Chinese goods. The EU has not approved either request so far. In 2004, the EU declined to lift the arms embargo following U.S. lobbying efforts, though some diplomats suggest the issue may be revisited. Regarding market economy status, the European Commission maintains that China does not yet meet the required technical criteria. This stance contrasts with the EU's 2002 decision to grant market economy status to Russia, which was made during an EU-Russia summit. The UK has expressed support for granting China market economy status by September, but other EU members have raised concerns about rising Chinese exports in textiles and other sectors. In 2004, the EU reported a trade deficit of 78 billion euros with China, the largest with any single trading partner, with total bilateral trade amounting to 174 billion euros. The European employers' association, Unice, recently advised against granting market economy status unless China meets reform criteria in its financial sector and other areas, stressing that the decision should be based on technical, not political, considerations."

But he said that rules to govern buyouts at small and midsize enterprises controlled by a local government will be issued \"pretty soon.\" It isn't clear exactly where authorities will draw the line between big and midsize companies, although there is speculation that companies with net assets valued at about 400 million yuan ($48 million) or less will be eligible for buyouts. In any event, authorities will evaluate proposed management buyouts on a case-by- case basis. The new rules will set guidelines for pricing assets to ensure sales at fair market value, and specify methods allowed for financing such deals, such as permitting loans from trust companies but generally not from banks. \"Our tenet is to encourage more outflow of state-owned assets, but to prevent them from being stolen,\" Mr. Li said. \"According to central party policy, private capital, including those from an MBO [management buyout], can enter into any economic sectors that aren't prohibited under current law.\" Even though China doesn't have a comprehensive set of rules on management buyouts, dozens of companies have undergone the process in recent years. In some cases, there has been fraud as senior managers have deliberately driven a company into the ground so they could buy it cheaply; in others, managers have acquired a company without putting in any of their own money, relying on bank loans obtained by using the company assets as collateral. The issuance of new rules could encourage managers of more listed companies to propose buyouts, especially in manufacturing and retail businesses such as electrical appliances, said Lu Manping, chief economist of China Tebon Securities in Shanghai. \"These are fully competitive industries, where state-run companies are more easily replaced by private players,\" he said. Management buyouts, which often link compensation of a company's staff more closely to its bottom line, can boost corporate performance. Two of China's earliest buyouts at listed companies, in the late 1990s, were at state-run Shanghai taxi companies Dazhong Transportation (Group) Co. and Shanghai Dazhong Public Utilities (Group) Co. After management and employees took control of the companies, they won reputations for high-quality service, and core business profits at both had doubled by 2002. Still, analysts note that many Chinese companies, even listed or private-sector companies, still lack transparent corporate governance. Also, they say, it is uncertain how comprehensive the new rules will be or if these can effectively curb abuses. Five executives of Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Co., a major dairy-products manufacturer listed in Shanghai, were arrested last year following allegations that state assets were embezzled during a management-buyout attempt. A Yili official declined to comment, saying authorities are still investigating. In some cases, a buyout process in China can be opaque. In November state-owned Yantai Changyu Group sold 45% of the group's assets to a company jointly held by the group's management and employees for 388 million yuan. Then in February the group sold a 33% stake to an Italian wine producer for 480 million yuan, a transaction that gave the group a value that was nearly 70% higher than at the time of the November buyout. Li Tingguo, a spokesman for the group's listed subsidiary, Yantai Changyu Pioneer Wine Co., said the November buyout price was set by the branch of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Bureau in Yantai city, whose government had owned the largest stake in the group. He declined to comment further. Liao Hong, an accounting expert based in the Chinese city of Wuhan, said in a recent report that most listed Chinese companies undergoing management buyouts don't initially see improved performance or higher returns for shareholders. Comparing performances of 18 listed companies that announced management buyouts from 2000 to 2002, his report said per-share earnings dropped at 10 of them, while core profits declined for 11 in the year following the buyout. Nearly all the companies had weaker cash flow and higher debt ratio afterward, his report said. Overall, how well a company does can hinge on China's business environment. \"A management buyout can be part of the solution, but it's not the answer,\" said Fraser Howie, Hong Kong author of a book on China's stock market. \"Now you've done an MBO, you're a private company. But do you have a fair playing field to compete? . . . You can be successful, but China's [business environment] is still not conducive to private players.\"",
        "debiased_text": "BEIJING -- China is preparing to issue regulations governing management buyouts at certain state-run companies. The rules aim to address concerns about past abuses that have resulted in losses to the state, while facilitating more sales of state assets with improved oversight. Management buyouts will remain prohibited at large state-run enterprises, according to Li Baomin, a deputy director at the research center of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. He stated that rules for small and midsize enterprises controlled by local governments will be released in the near future. The criteria distinguishing large from midsize companies have not been finalized, though companies with net assets valued at approximately 400 million yuan ($48 million) or less may qualify for buyouts. Each proposed buyout will be evaluated individually. The regulations will establish asset pricing standards to ensure transactions reflect fair market value and outline approved financing methods, such as allowing loans from trust companies while typically prohibiting bank loans. 'The objective is to facilitate the transfer of state-owned assets while preventing misuse,' said Li. 'Current policy permits private capital, including from management buyouts, to enter economic sectors not prohibited by law.' Although China lacks comprehensive management buyout regulations, numerous companies have completed such transactions in recent years. Some cases have involved fraudulent practices, such as managers deliberately devaluing companies to purchase them at lower prices, or acquiring companies without personal investment by using company assets as loan collateral. New rules may lead more managers of listed companies, particularly in manufacturing and retail sectors like electrical appliances, to pursue buyouts, according to Lu Manping, chief economist at China Tebon Securities in Shanghai. 'These industries are highly competitive, with state-run companies more likely to be replaced by private entities,' he said. Management buyouts, which align employee compensation with company performance, have in some cases improved corporate results. Two early buyouts in the late 1990s involved Shanghai-based taxi companies Dazhong Transportation (Group) Co. and Shanghai Dazhong Public Utilities (Group) Co. Following their buyouts, both companies reported improved service and doubled core business profits by 2002. Analysts note that many Chinese companies, including listed and private firms, still lack transparent governance structures. Questions remain about the scope of the new regulations and their effectiveness in preventing abuses. Last year, five executives at Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Co., a Shanghai-listed dairy producer, were arrested following allegations of embezzlement during a management buyout attempt. Company officials stated the investigation is ongoing. Some buyout processes have raised transparency concerns. In November, state-owned Yantai Changyu Group sold 45% of its assets to a company owned by its management and employees for 388 million yuan. Three months later, the group sold a 33% stake to an Italian wine producer for 480 million yuan, a transaction that valued the company nearly 70% higher than the November sale. A spokesman for the group's listed unit, Yantai Changyu Pioneer Wine Co., said the initial buyout price was determined by local state asset regulators but declined further comment. A recent report by Wuhan-based accounting expert Liao Hong found that most listed Chinese companies undergoing management buyouts do not show immediate performance improvements or higher shareholder returns. The study of 18 listed companies announcing buyouts between 2000 and 2002 showed decreased per-share earnings at 10 firms and declining core profits at 11 in the following year. Nearly all companies experienced weaker cash flow and higher debt ratios post-buyout. Market observers note that company performance after buyouts depends on broader business conditions in China. 'While management buyouts can contribute to solutions, they are not a complete answer,' said Fraser Howie, a Hong Kong-based author on China's stock market. 'Transitioning to private ownership doesn't guarantee a level competitive field, as China's business environment continues to present challenges for private enterprises.'"

        "title": "CHINA SYNDROME SUDDENLY WASHINGTON IS TALKING TOUGH ABOUT CHINA. BUT WHAT EXACTLY HAS CHANGED?: [THIRD EDITION]",
        "original_text": "Drake Bennett is the staff writer for Ideas. His e-mail address drbennett@globe.com.\nIN SINGAPORE LAST SUNDAY, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld told an audience of Asian defense officials and military officers that their neighbor China was a liar and a threat. \"China's defense expenditures are much higher than Chinese officials have publicly admitted. It is estimated that China's is the third- largest military budget in the world, and now the largest in Asia,\" he said, citing findings from a forthcoming Pentagon report. \"Since no nation threatens China one wonders: Why this growing investment?\" Rumsfeld's comments created a stir, but they fit with an increasingly angry and alarmed tone in Washington over China in recent months. Bending to pressure from American businesses and congressmen from both political parties, the Bush administration has sharpened its criticisms of China for undervaluing its currency, keeping foreign goods out of its markets, and ignoring intellectual property protections. In February, CIA director Porter Goss told the Senate Intelligence Committee that \"Beijing's military modernization and military buildup [are] tilting the balance of power in the Taiwan Strait\" and \"threaten US forces in the region.\" The administration has strenuously objected to European proposals to ease an embargo on arms sales to China. And the Pentagon report Rumsfeld drew on in Singapore is said to describe China's military in decidedly more ominous terms than in previous years. As the Financial Times wrote in a news analysis this spring, \"With Iraq and the Middle East no longer the only topic of conversation in Washington, policymakers and analysts from members of Congress to career diplomats are already talking about the 'China threat' more than at any time since 2001.\" To many, it all seems very familiar, a return to the open suspicion of China that the Bush administration brought with it into office four and a half years ago. But is it? Several prominent scholars and policy analysts caution against reading too much into recent events. Even if the administration does want to return to its administration does want to return to its old confrontational stance, some argue, it must first do some significant rethinking - in part because the United States remains deeply entangled in Iraq and Afghanistan, but also because China today already presents a qualitatively different challenge than it did even four years ago. . . . \"China has never been a country you have the luxury of not thinking about,\" says Michael O'Hanlon, a foreign policy scholar at the Brookings Institution. Indeed, what now looks like a change of course on China, says Richard Haass, who retired as director of policy planning at the State Department in June 2003 and is now president of the Council on Foreign Relations, is in fact a long-running administration debate making its way to the surface. \"The Bush administration has always been of more than one mind on China,\" said Haass in a recent interview. \"There's always been a view within the administration . . . that China is a threat, or at a minimum, a potential threat.\" That school of thought was dominant in the early months of the Bush administration. Bush had run in 2000 as a fierce critic of China and the Clinton administration's policy of treating the country as a \"strategic partner.\" The more appropriate term, Bush said in campaign interviews, was \"strategic competitor.\" But eager for assistance in the war on terrorism after Sept. 11, 2001, and looking for support on the Security Council for an ultimatum to Iraq a year later, the administration soon began to treat China more like an ally. Bush became the first American president to visit China twice in one year and invited Jiang Zemin, then China's president, to his ranch in Crawford, Texas. High-level military exchanges and talks were revived, and the United States, at China's request, put an ethnic Uighur separatist group in China's northwest Xinjiang province on the State Department's terrorism watch list. Last September, Condoleezza Rice, then national security adviser, said the Bush administration had \"the best relationship that any administration has had with China.\" According to Haass and O'Hanlon, 9/11 and Iraq in essence gave the upper hand to moderates in the administration like then-Secretary of State Colin Powell, who argued for greater engagement with China. Powell's absence in Bush's second term may have strengthened hawks like Rumsfeld, but according to Jonathan Pollack, an Asian and Pacific studies professor at the Naval War College, Bush has given little sign that he has aligned himself with them. Bush, says Pollack, \"realizes that he has to rely on China.\" On no issue is that reliance more apparent than on North Korea and its nuclear program. Indeed, most observers see the administration's recent round of criticisms stemming in part from frustration with China's unwillingness to exert more of its influence on North Korea. Pollack suggests that if talks with North Korea resume, and if progress is made (an admittedly big if), the administration's language toward China could quickly lose its edge. In general, as Pollack sees it, American policy on China is at the moment highly contingent, depending on an unexpected confluence of unrelated events. (The dispute over the value of the yuan, for example, has little to do with North Korea.) \"There's often a tendency,\" Pollack says, \"to attribute more causality in these situations than is warranted to the fact that so many things seem to be coinciding.\" . . . As Richard Haass puts it, even if there's been an element of coincidence to recent China-related news, the fact remains that \"China is a rising power.\" James Mann, author of two books on US- China relations and, most recently, \"The Vulcans: The History of Bush's War Cabinet,\" agrees that it's premature to speak of any new direction in China policy. But he nonetheless sees a new sense of alarm over China emanating from the Bush administration. Part of the concern, Mann says, grows out of a realization that China represents a thornier problem than it did only a few years ago. Traditionally, as a military and diplomatic matter, China has been predominantly seen through the lens of the Taiwan question: how to protect Taiwan's autonomy without provoking China into military action. While Taiwan remains important, Mann argues, \"the concern has shifted.\" Now, says Mann, the administration is asking itself, \"what if China is so powerful that all the other East Asian countries defer to it?\" In other words, what if traditional allies like South Korea start to throw in their lot, militarily and diplomatically as well as economically, with China instead of the United States? John Mearsheimer, a University of Chicago political scientist and leading scholar of international relations, believes that Japan and South Korea are already growing nervous that the United States won't \"be there for them\" if trouble with China arises. At the same time, however, he predicts little meaningful change in US-China policy in the short-term, largely because the Middle East will continue to monopolize the administration's attention. \"We're going to continue to focus on the Middle East at the expense of Asia-and Europe.\" Still, as Mearsheimer and others readily concede, the future of US-China policy is anything but clear. \"It's very early in the game, China is in the early stages of its rise,\" Mearsheimer says. \"This is kind of like looking at Germany in 1882, not Germany in 1912.\" Haass is somewhat more sanguine. (His new book, \"The Opportunity: America's Moment to Alter History's Course,\" is in part about the \"opportunity to integrate China into a US-led world order.\") Still, he agrees that it's too soon to make long-term projections. \"It's possible in 25 years we could wake up and we'll have a US-China Cold War. We could also wake up in 25 years and see the US and China selectively cooperate on various global and regional concerns just as they do now.\" \"History suggests,\" Haass goes on, \"that working out relations between a dominant power and a rising power always involves friction. It's almost like geology, when tectonic plates run up against one another. The potential is always there for friction, or worse.\"",
        "debiased_text": "In Singapore last Sunday, US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld addressed Asian defense officials and military officers, stating that China's defense expenditures are higher than publicly acknowledged. He cited an upcoming Pentagon report estimating China's military budget as the third-largest globally and the largest in Asia. Rumsfeld questioned the reasons behind China's increased military spending, given the absence of a direct threat to the country. His remarks followed heightened criticism from the Bush administration regarding China's currency valuation, market access, and intellectual property protections. CIA Director Porter Goss previously told the Senate Intelligence Committee that China's military modernization affects the balance of power in the Taiwan Strait and poses a concern for US forces in the region. The Pentagon report referenced by Rumsfeld is said to describe China's military in stronger terms than in previous years. Some analysts suggest that discussions about a 'China threat' have increased in Washington since early 2023. However, several experts caution against overinterpreting recent developments, noting that US priorities in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as China's evolving role, complicate policy shifts. Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution emphasized that China remains a significant consideration in foreign policy. Richard Haass, former State Department official and current Council on Foreign Relations president, noted internal divisions within the Bush administration on China, with some viewing it as a strategic competitor and others seeking cooperation, particularly after 9/11 and during negotiations on Iraq. High-level exchanges between the US and China increased during this period, and China requested the inclusion of a Uighur separatist group on the US terrorism watch list. Current US-China relations are described as contingent on multiple factors, including North Korea's nuclear program, where China's influence is seen as critical. Experts suggest that progress on North Korea could ease tensions, while unresolved issues such as currency valuation remain separate concerns. Observers like James Mann note a shift in focus beyond Taiwan to broader strategic questions about China's regional influence. John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago anticipates little immediate change in US-China policy due to ongoing Middle East engagements. Long-term predictions about the relationship vary, with possibilities ranging from intensified competition to continued selective cooperation."

        "title": "Full text: Gordon Brown's speech to Labour party conference",
        "original_text": "Let me first thank you, each of you, and through you the hundreds, the thousands, of Labour party members for the work done, week in week out, year in year out, to secure a historic third term victory, a victory not just in Labour votes and in Labour seats, but a victory for our Labour values. And let us recognise the debt we owe to Tony Blair for this achievement. It was only because of our victory that yesterday, on your behalf in Washington at the IMF and World Bank, Britain was able to propose and achieve for the poorest countries £55bn of debts written off for ever, the delivery of debt cancellation of 100%. And Hilary Benn and I want to thank you and the churches, faith groups, and all decent minded people committed to make poverty history. It is because of you that the world has come together to double aid to Africa. It is because of your commitment that, within five years, millions more Aids sufferers will have help. It is because of your persistence that 11 European governments - and I am proud that Europe has led the way - are now pledged as we are to meet the UN target of 0.7% of national income spent on aid. And it is because of your efforts that in the last few days we have also announced a $4bn finance facility for immunisation that in Africa and Asia will save the lives of 10 million children. So don't let the cynics tell you aid doesn't work, that governments can't make a difference and that all politicians are the same; what doesn't work is doing nothing. And this year let us do more. Because if we are to make poverty history, we must make the scandal and waste of agricultural protectionism history. Let us make agricultural export subsidies history. Let us seek to make the excesses of the CAP history. And, because we owe it to all the people who suffer needless pain and avoidable deaths, owe it to every child denied the chance of school, owe it to every human being who goes hungry every night, let us join together to affirm that, to finally and truly make poverty history, Britain will lead a worldwide effort to ensure for the poorest countries universal free public services, universal free schooling for all children and free universal health care for all who need it. This is a year which has brought the world's greatest natural disaster, the tsunami, witnessed hurricanes cause havoc and hurt some of the poorest people in the richest country in the world, seen London move in just one day from the joy we all share of becoming an Olympic city to the horror of homegrown suicide bombers maiming and killing fellow British citizens. With us yesterday were some of the thousands of public servants who on July 7 did not falter and did not fail but selflessly - even when some were injured - served the public first, treating the wounded, comforting the bereaved, never asking what was the creed or colour or religion of those they helped: public service at its best, not just a career but a calling, the ethic of duty, care, compassion and service. They are the quiet heroes of our country and we pay tribute to them today. And let no one doubt that we will spend what it takes, bear each and every hardship, endure each and every sacrifice, and as Jack Straw, Charles Clarke and John Reid have said both internationally in Afghanistan and Iraq and at home we will at all times have the strength and resolution so that there is no hiding place for terrorists - or those who finance terrorism - and so we will protect and defend the security of the people of this country. And we will have the strength and resolution to take the right long-term economic decisions too. Why has it been that at every point since 1997 faced with the Asian crisis, the IT collapse, a stock exchange crash, an American recession, last year a house price bubble, this year rising world oil prices, why has it been that at every point since 1997 Britain uniquely has continued to grow? In any other decade, a house price bubble would have pushed Britain from boom to bust. In any other decade, a doubling of oil prices would have put Britain first in last out and worst hit by a world downturn. I tell you, it is because with Bank of England independence, cutting debt, fiscal discipline and the New Deal this Labour government has shown the strength to take the tough long-term decisions, that inflation is low, interest rates are low, growth has been sustained in every year, and we are closer than ever to the goal which drives us forward: the goal of full employment for our generation. Labour, the natural party for economic strength in our country today. Remember, for 18 years, the Tories said that the only way to arrest British economic decline was to condemn 3 million of our fellow citizens to unemployment, they said that to have a strong economy you had to abandon social justice. We have proved that, on the economy, they were not only unfair, they were wrong. Let us be proud that we, Labour, have proved that Britain can grow faster, create half a million businesses, add 2 million more jobs, and still double public spending on health, education, transport and policing and we should be proud we have so far also taken 1 million children and 1 million pensioners out of poverty, Britain showing the world that economic prosperity and social justice can advance together. And friends we must not ever put the goal of full employment at risk by returning to the old days of inflationary pay rises and conflict, the old days of putting sectional interests ahead of the national interest, and we will and must continue to pursue what we promised in our manifesto: stability in economic management, stability in industry policy, stability in industrial relations, and stability in the public finances and in our demand for efficiency and value for money, a more personalised service, and accountability and real choices and the highest of standards in our public services. And in the face of today's inflationary oil prices I give you the assurance that we will not be diverted; at all times we will continue to take the right long-term decisions to maintain stability and prosperity for Britain. And to steer that course of stability I call on world oil producers and oil companies now to support the British plan agreed this weekend by the whole international community to raise production, to open the books, prevent high prices hurting the poor, and - let us be clear - to do what should have been done years ago: to promote the environmental agenda for energy efficiency and alternative sources of energy. And, with the same strength and the same resolution, we must meet and master what is now the biggest global industrial restructuring in our economic history and become the party of economic prosperity for Britain, not just for this decade but for the next. The rise of China - now producing almost half the world's electronic goods and soon half the world's clothes. Everywhere the pace of innovation is faster than ever before, every day global competition more threatening than ever before. And I tell you: in face of this global challenge let us agree that we will not make the mistake of the 1930s and - as John Prescott said yesterday - there will be no retreat into protectionism and there will be no retreat into anti-Europeanism because, unlike the Tories, we see British engagement in an outward-looking, reforming Europe as essential for Britain's future. And we will not either make the mistakes of the 1920s and we will not surrender to a Tory do-nothing, free market dogma. Our choice not protectionism, not isolationism, not laissez faire, but mobilising the skills, ideas and talents of all the British people. Because we the Labour party understand that in this new world a nation cannot be first in prosperity if you are second in education. So, our economic goal now and for the future must be to become the world's number one power in education. And that means matching the best in the world for standards in our schools, leading in science, excelling for the creativity and inventiveness of all our people. And how will this be done? The lesson is that at a time when China and India are producing 4 million graduates a year, we, Britain - a small country - cannot now afford to neglect the potential of any single child, or to write off the talents of any single young person. Indeed, because in this new world the only way to realise the potential of each of us is to realise the potential of all of us, let us agree that a Labour Britain will, for the first time, offer education not - as under the Tories from 5 to 16 - but, with Labour, from the age of 3 to the age of 18. And we should be proud too that, for the first time, Britain is offering and financing the right to lifelong learning, including trade union learning, open to every adult. And, because no child, even the most troubled child, should be left behind, we must, as Ruth Kelly has said, intervene early. And instead of a dozen agencies spending £100,000 a year per child and often not solving the problem, there will be one lead professional, in time also the one account holder for that £100,000, with the freedom and capacity to do what is right for that child. And let us also agree an industry, a plan that first making our universities world class, second investing long term in science, third encouraging enterprise and - fourth - with the new manufacturing service and forum, offering, as Alan Johnson and Alistair Darling are announcing, practical financial support for innovation, engineering, the regions and our transport and infrastructure, all so that we will build for Britain and all our regions and nations, modern manufacturing strength. And because it is unacceptable that in the European single market Britain loses out to those who flout the rules, we will use our European presidency to champion economic reform and to open up competition and we will work to ensure that British inventions can and will mean British jobs in British companies for British workers. And because, with Labour, Britain will not compete on lower pay but on higher skills, we will do what the Tories have never, in all their 200 years' history, been prepared to do: from next week we will again raise the national minimum wage, up 40% since we introduced it, and I want to thank all those who campaigned successfully to extend the minimum wage for the first time to 16 and 17 year olds. And because it is wrong to penalise public sector workers when they are facing necessary change, let us tell them that we will meet our pledge to end the two-tier workforce, in each and every area - including paid holidays - honouring our Warwick commitments. Because no employer should ever be allowed to cut corners that puts lives and safety at risk, we will do what the Tories never would: we will legislate against the crime of corporate manslaughter and we will take power to root out gangmasters guilty of deadly abuses. And let me repeat our fundamental commitment to justice for all those on pensions and planning their pensions. It was a scandal that men and women who lost their jobs when firms went under lost their pensions too, and we should be proud that in the last year it is Labour that has created the first ever pension protection fund, Labour that has provided £400m more for those who lost out in past years, Labour that has made the promise that in the spending round the £400m will be reviewed and it is Labour that, as David Blunkett has said, has established the pension commission and asked them to examine the case for moving beyond voluntarism. Labour, the party of the first ever winter allowance, the first ever free TV licenses, the first ever national system for free local bus travel and the first ever pension credit helping 2 million pensioners: all measures on our way to ensuring that not just some but all our pensioners have justice and dignity in retirement. And none of these challenges could ever be met by Tory free market dogma, or by Liberal incoherence. Just last week the Liberals told us how tough they wanted to be, how they were now facing up to the difficult decisions, how we would see - and this was their slogan - tough liberalism in action. When you see them in local government, when did Liberals ever face up to a tough decision? And how did their toughness manifest itself last week? They dropped their tax pledges, but they kept all their spending pledges. So, in the run-up to the local elections let us expose a Liberal party whose sums and whole philosophy never add up, so opportunist locally and nationally that today they are simply incapable of facing up to the big economic challenges. And what of the Conservatives? They know that to make the public forget the miseries of the pre-1997 years they need new faces, modern ideas, a fresh start, a clean break. And who have emerged as the new faces? Kenneth Clarke - former Tory chancellor; Malcolm Rifkin - former Tory foreign secretary; David Davies - former minister for Europe; Liam Fox - former foreign office minister and David Cameron - the only new face - is an old Etonian. Their answer to their problems: not new 21st century conservatives, today's Tory party simply the same old rerun of the same old boys' network. Since 1997 the Tories have had: four leaders - now four systems for electing their leader; seven shadow chancellors, I remember them well, well most of them, and I look forward to welcoming the eighth. With the current one they made a virtue of skipping a generation. On the evidence so far they should probably skip another one. Four leaders, six shadow chief secretaries, seven trade and industry spokesmen. All reflecting one fundamental problem: they remain wedded to an out of date free market dogma so backward looking that cannot begin to prepare Britain for the tasks ahead. What is their new big idea? A flat tax. An idea that they say is sweeping the world, well sweeping Estonia, well a wing of the neo-conservatives in Estonia. The Tories promising to do for national tax what they did for local tax with their last big idea, the poll tax. And let the flat tax go the way of the poll tax. The millionaire to pay exactly the same tax rate as the young nurse, the home help, the worker on the minimum wage. The price tag - £50bn of cuts in public services. It's clear that they've already decided they've lost the last three elections not because they were too rightwing but not rightwing enough. Let us tell the electorate at the local elections and at every election that the party that gave you the poll tax and now threatens the flat tax has learnt nothing and forgotten nothing, totally incapable of equipping Britain for the years ahead. So,when the Tories tell you the next election will be old Labour versus new Conservatives, tell them the truth. The next election must and will be new Labour renewed against a Conservative party still incapable of renewal. When they tell you that at the next election we will abandon reform in Britain, tell them the Labour party was founded so that by our Labour values we could reform Britain, that the great Labour governments of the last century were great because they were reforming progressive governments that transformed Britain, and that the only future of the Labour party is as the party of reform. And the history of our movement tells us how we succeed in transforming our country: putting British values - fairness to all, responsibility from all - at the core of all we do, and reaching out to the country to build a progressive consensus around them. Labour: the voice of the mainstream majority, A Britain of aspiration and ambition and opportunity for all not just a few. The mission: to build a progressive consensus for our time, and that is how we will not just inhabit the centre ground but dominate it. And, as befits us as a party that stands for progressive change, our focus is not on what we have achieved, important as it is, but on what we have yet to achieve. And, after eight years - when we are doing more than any government to widen opportunity, doing more to invest in our communities - we know also that we are, as yet today, a Britain of still too little opportunity, a Britain of still too little responsibility, a Britain of still too little community. Parents struggling amidst an even faster pace of change to balance work and family life, young people with wider horizons than ever, wanting in business, education, sport and the arts, more chances and choices to make more of themselves; as Tessa Jowell and Patricia Hewitt have said, women wanting this to be the generation where the promise of equality is finally and fully realised; citizens yearning for a stronger sense of community, free from the fear of crime and with the power to improve the quality of life in their area; people seeking new ways to engage, have their voices heard and build trust in our local and national life; across differences of race and religion, men and women seeking a stronger foundation for community relations. People for whom we, this generation's Labour party, have to find modern answers, meeting rising individual aspirations - the new twenty first century individualism - while also - and this is the new 21st century citizenship - showing how a supportive community can empower and enable so that people can realise their potential as individuals and make a contribution to community life. And we will respond in the pre-budget report to the dream of young couples to own their own homes with our plan for 1 million new affordable homes; meet the aspirations of workers who want to have a real stake in their firms with incentives for employee shares; and, with the child trust fund, ensure that 5 million children who do not have assets today will, by 2010, have assets of their own, striving for Britain to be a home-owning, share-owning, asset-owning, wealth-owning democracy, not just for some but for all: honouring our party's constitution, putting power, wealth and opportunity in the hands of the many and not just the few. Let me say to conference: I believe Tony Blair deserves huge credit, not just for winning three elections but for leading the Labour party for more than a decade. And in the same way he deserves credit for leading us through these difficult and challenging years. He also deserves credit for now asking us and challenging us as a party to begin to plan ahead. And, because the renewal of new Labour will be as profound a challenge, as rigorous a task and as great an achievement as the creation of new Labour, I will - in the next year - visit every region and nation of our country. With you I want to listen, hear and learn and to discuss the economic, social and constitutional changes we need to build for the future. And I believe that, since 1997, as we have advanced toward full employment, reformed markets and state, mobilised the private sector as partners for the public interest and promoted policies for social justice, we have not talked enough about their ethical foundations, of what, at root, gives purpose to our politics and builds trust in public service: the responsibilities we owe to each other and the opportunities it is our duty to extend. This is nothing less than the moral basis of the society we seek to create. For why are we in politics? Why am I in politics? I will never forget what I was brought up to believe. I learned from my parents not just to do my best and to work hard but to treat everyone equally, to respect others, to tell the truth, to take responsibility. I learned from my mother and father that for every opportunity there was an obligation, for every demand a duty, for every chance given, a contribution to be made. And when they said to me that for every right there was a responsibility, for them that was not just words. What they meant was quite simple and straightforward, for me my moral compass. In return for what we received we had a duty to put something back one moral community of fairness to all, responsibilities from all. And what does this mean for our time? A welfare state where support when unemployed is matched by the duty to seek work and skills for work. In education, truly lifelong opportunities for learning for all, matched by responsibilities on all of us - employees and employers too - to make the most of them. In our health service, the right to the highest standard of free health care, matched by a sense of responsibility not to abuse that right. In community relations, the respect for diversity and the rights of individuals matched by the responsibility to integrate as a community and each play our part as citizens. In a family policy, in parenting contracts and orders, support for parents matched by responsibilities they accept. In corporate life, business valued and contributing to social progress, those at the top showing the same responsibility they ask of others. A youth policy tough on crime, with faster youth justice and tough also on the causes of crime with better youth services. And, for all of us, a responsibility to each and every one of us not to pass by on the other side. Britain no longer defined and diminished by the divisive ideology of them and us, of something for nothing, that denied Britain a shared national purpose and stripped away our sense of community. Britain no longer defined and weakened by the centralisation that forgot we are both individuals and neighbours. No longer \"the grab what you can\" glorification of everyone for himself, \"no such thing as society\" which told people to ask only what they could get for themselves. Never again a Britain of them and us, never again the man in Whitehall knows best, but the Britain of we, the British people, together: a great British society where a new generation of British people can aim as high as they can reach, are empowered to pursue their dreams, the spirit of British enterprise celebrated, a society that at the same time recognises that we are citizens as well as consumers, that the public square is more than a marketplace, that we are bound together by more than contracts markets and exchange - by a shared commitment to the ethics of duty service and care. And nowhere does this come alive for us more than in our duty and determination as parents, as neighbours, as citizens, that every child can fulfil their potential and that no child is left out. And it is here that our economic mission for Britain - to be number one in education - comes together with our moral cause: that every child has the best start in life, that no one is left behind. And I believe this is a vision that defines us as a community and as a country inspires a new sense of mission. For it was an outrage that, in the Tory years, one child in every three born in our country was born into poverty. It was shameful that Britain had the worst record for child poverty of all the countries in Europe. It was an affront to human dignity that a poor child from a poor family was three times more likely to die before the age of one; an assault on every idea we hold dear about equal opportunity that teenagers from poor families had a tenth of the chance of higher education. Perhaps the greatest injustice of all is for millions of children never even to know what they had it in them to become. Friends, the whole of human history until now can be seen as yes the triumph of the human spirit but yes also the tragic waste of vast reserves of human potential. Our whole history as a nation the outpouring of great genius by some but the loss of the great potential of too many. Reflect for a moment on the talent wasted, the loss of what might have been, the great music never composed, the great art never created, the great science never invented, the great books never written. And if, in this generation, we neglect the potential of still too many of our children, if we do not learn from past mistakes and again write off the talents of still too many young people, think of the individual dreams unfulfilled, the hopes dashed, the ambitions crushed, the potential wasted. And for Britain, society weakened, culture depleted, prosperity diminished, progress denied, our country losing something of its innermost soul. So let ours be the last generation that developed only some of the potential of some of the people, and let us be the first generation to commit itself to developing all of the potential of all of the people. So every time child tax credits lift a child out of poverty, every time a child who would have denied opportunities under the Tories enjoys early learning with Sure Start, every time a teenager who under the Tories would have left school without qualifications stays on because of educational maintenance allowances, let us celebrate this as a victory, not just for these young people, but a victory for our Labour values. And let us promise ourselves that, within five years time, we will meet even more challenging goals: help 3 million children onto Sure Start, provide educational maintenance allowances for all teenagers who need them, increase the rights and responsibilities of families so that we can meet our objective, to halve child poverty by 2010 on the road to abolishing it in a generation. And when Conservatives say the abolition of child poverty, giving every child the best start, becoming number one in education, when they tell us these are impossible ambitions and unrealisable dreams, let us remind them of the history of Great Britain, that reactionaries told us that to abolish slavery was an impossible cause. Conservatives said that to end child Labour was an economic and social disaster; cynics told us education beyond elementary school was wasteful and unaffordable; the rightwing told us that health care could never be anything other than bought and sold in the marketplace or left to charity. So when Conservatives tell us today that ending child poverty is a naive hope, an unrealistic ideal, tell them there was a generation of decent, committed and visionary British people that led the world and 200 years ago did abolish slavery, tell them there was a generation of British citizens that led the world and 150 years ago did abolish child labour. A generation that led the world and 100 years ago created free universal education for every child and, having achieved the greatest of goals, moved on to lead the world yet again. And 50 years ago a new generation of British men and women created our national health service to deliver universal free health care for all. Tell them that it was not pessimists and reactionaries who built Britain's greatness but visionaries, optimists, and idealists. And so when it is asked centuries from now who were the people who rid this country of child poverty, who gave every child the best start in life, let it be said it was this Labour party, this Labour government, this generation of dedicated men and women who led the way. I think today of those we have lost. I think of Robin Cook, Mo Mowlam and Jim Callaghan How would they wish to be remembered? Not for titles, status, power or wealth but for the great difference they made. And what do we want to be remembered for? Yes that as individuals we eased someone's loneliness, lifted someone's spirits, we helped someone in trouble, but even more, that as citizens of a community working together, we helped not just some but helped millions. That we demonstrated by our actions that we understood the pain and hopes of others. That in our day and in our generation we built a society of people who believing in something bigger than themselves created a Britain where by the strong helping the weak we are all stronger. Our mission: new Labour renewed. Our values: fairness for all, responsibility from all. Our country: united as one moral community. A great British society. This we stand for. And this together we can and will achieve.",
        "debiased_text": "The Labour Party has secured a historic third term victory, with notable outcomes in votes and seats. Britain recently proposed and achieved a $55 billion debt cancellation for the poorest countries at the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington. This initiative received support from churches, faith groups, and organizations committed to poverty reduction. As a result, aid to Africa has doubled, and 11 European governments have pledged to meet the UN target of 0.7% of national income spent on aid. Additionally, a $4 billion finance facility for immunization in Africa and Asia was announced, aiming to save the lives of 10 million children. Measures to address agricultural protectionism and export subsidies were also discussed.\n\nIn 2005, the world experienced significant natural disasters, including the tsunami and hurricanes, while London faced both the celebration of winning the Olympic bid and the July 7 terrorist attacks. Public servants played a critical role in responding to the attacks, providing aid without discrimination.\n\nThe UK has maintained economic growth since 1997 despite challenges such as the Asian financial crisis, the IT collapse, and rising oil prices. Policies such as Bank of England independence, fiscal discipline, and the New Deal have contributed to low inflation, low interest rates, and sustained growth. Employment has increased, with 2 million more jobs created, and public spending on health, education, transport, and policing has doubled. Efforts have also reduced child and pensioner poverty by 1 million each.\n\nThe Labour Party has emphasized long-term economic stability, opposing inflationary pay rises and promoting efficiency in public services. A plan was introduced to address rising oil prices by increasing production and promoting energy efficiency. The UK has also focused on education, expanding access from ages 3 to 18 and providing lifelong learning opportunities. Public sector workers were assured protections, including an end to the two-tier workforce and legislation against corporate manslaughter.\n\nPension reforms include the creation of a pension protection fund and additional support for those who lost pensions due to corporate failures. The Labour Party has introduced measures such as winter allowances, free TV licenses, and pension credits.\n\nCriticism was directed at the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. The Liberals were accused of fiscal inconsistency, while the Conservatives were described as relying on outdated policies and personnel. The Conservative proposal for a flat tax was dismissed as detrimental to public services.\n\nThe Labour Party reaffirmed its commitment to reform, social justice, and economic growth, contrasting its policies with those of opposition parties. Goals include reducing child poverty, improving education, and expanding affordable housing. The party highlighted historical achievements such as the abolition of slavery, child labor laws, universal education, and the NHS as evidence of progressive reforms.\n\nIn conclusion, the Labour Party emphasized values of fairness, responsibility, and community, aiming to build a united and prosperous society. The speech honored past leaders and called for continued efforts to address societal challenges."

        "title": "CHINA SYNDROME SUDDENLY WASHINGTON IS TALKING TOUGH ABOUT CHINA. BUT WHAT EXACTLY HAS CHANGED?: [THIRD EDITION]",
        "original_text": "Drake Bennett is the staff writer for Ideas. His e-mail address drbennett@globe.com.\nIN SINGAPORE LAST SUNDAY, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld told an audience of Asian defense officials and military officers that their neighbor China was a liar and a threat. \"China's defense expenditures are much higher than Chinese officials have publicly admitted. It is estimated that China's is the third- largest military budget in the world, and now the largest in Asia,\" he said, citing findings from a forthcoming Pentagon report. \"Since no nation threatens China one wonders: Why this growing investment?\" Rumsfeld's comments created a stir, but they fit with an increasingly angry and alarmed tone in Washington over China in recent months. Bending to pressure from American businesses and congressmen from both political parties, the Bush administration has sharpened its criticisms of China for undervaluing its currency, keeping foreign goods out of its markets, and ignoring intellectual property protections. In February, CIA director Porter Goss told the Senate Intelligence Committee that \"Beijing's military modernization and military buildup [are] tilting the balance of power in the Taiwan Strait\" and \"threaten US forces in the region.\" The administration has strenuously objected to European proposals to ease an embargo on arms sales to China. And the Pentagon report Rumsfeld drew on in Singapore is said to describe China's military in decidedly more ominous terms than in previous years. As the Financial Times wrote in a news analysis this spring, \"With Iraq and the Middle East no longer the only topic of conversation in Washington, policymakers and analysts from members of Congress to career diplomats are already talking about the 'China threat' more than at any time since 2001.\" To many, it all seems very familiar, a return to the open suspicion of China that the Bush administration brought with it into office four and a half years ago. But is it? Several prominent scholars and policy analysts caution against reading too much into recent events. Even if the administration does want to return to its administration does want to return to its old confrontational stance, some argue, it must first do some significant rethinking - in part because the United States remains deeply entangled in Iraq and Afghanistan, but also because China today already presents a qualitatively different challenge than it did even four years ago. . . . \"China has never been a country you have the luxury of not thinking about,\" says Michael O'Hanlon, a foreign policy scholar at the Brookings Institution. Indeed, what now looks like a change of course on China, says Richard Haass, who retired as director of policy planning at the State Department in June 2003 and is now president of the Council on Foreign Relations, is in fact a long-running administration debate making its way to the surface. \"The Bush administration has always been of more than one mind on China,\" said Haass in a recent interview. \"There's always been a view within the administration . . . that China is a threat, or at a minimum, a potential threat.\" That school of thought was dominant in the early months of the Bush administration. Bush had run in 2000 as a fierce critic of China and the Clinton administration's policy of treating the country as a \"strategic partner.\" The more appropriate term, Bush said in campaign interviews, was \"strategic competitor.\" But eager for assistance in the war on terrorism after Sept. 11, 2001, and looking for support on the Security Council for an ultimatum to Iraq a year later, the administration soon began to treat China more like an ally. Bush became the first American president to visit China twice in one year and invited Jiang Zemin, then China's president, to his ranch in Crawford, Texas. High-level military exchanges and talks were revived, and the United States, at China's request, put an ethnic Uighur separatist group in China's northwest Xinjiang province on the State Department's terrorism watch list. Last September, Condoleezza Rice, then national security adviser, said the Bush administration had \"the best relationship that any administration has had with China.\" According to Haass and O'Hanlon, 9/11 and Iraq in essence gave the upper hand to moderates in the administration like then-Secretary of State Colin Powell, who argued for greater engagement with China. Powell's absence in Bush's second term may have strengthened hawks like Rumsfeld, but according to Jonathan Pollack, an Asian and Pacific studies professor at the Naval War College, Bush has given little sign that he has aligned himself with them. Bush, says Pollack, \"realizes that he has to rely on China.\" On no issue is that reliance more apparent than on North Korea and its nuclear program. Indeed, most observers see the administration's recent round of criticisms stemming in part from frustration with China's unwillingness to exert more of its influence on North Korea. Pollack suggests that if talks with North Korea resume, and if progress is made (an admittedly big if), the administration's language toward China could quickly lose its edge. In general, as Pollack sees it, American policy on China is at the moment highly contingent, depending on an unexpected confluence of unrelated events. (The dispute over the value of the yuan, for example, has little to do with North Korea.) \"There's often a tendency,\" Pollack says, \"to attribute more causality in these situations than is warranted to the fact that so many things seem to be coinciding.\" . . . As Richard Haass puts it, even if there's been an element of coincidence to recent China-related news, the fact remains that \"China is a rising power.\" James Mann, author of two books on US- China relations and, most recently, \"The Vulcans: The History of Bush's War Cabinet,\" agrees that it's premature to speak of any new direction in China policy. But he nonetheless sees a new sense of alarm over China emanating from the Bush administration. Part of the concern, Mann says, grows out of a realization that China represents a thornier problem than it did only a few years ago. Traditionally, as a military and diplomatic matter, China has been predominantly seen through the lens of the Taiwan question: how to protect Taiwan's autonomy without provoking China into military action. While Taiwan remains important, Mann argues, \"the concern has shifted.\" Now, says Mann, the administration is asking itself, \"what if China is so powerful that all the other East Asian countries defer to it?\" In other words, what if traditional allies like South Korea start to throw in their lot, militarily and diplomatically as well as economically, with China instead of the United States? John Mearsheimer, a University of Chicago political scientist and leading scholar of international relations, believes that Japan and South Korea are already growing nervous that the United States won't \"be there for them\" if trouble with China arises. At the same time, however, he predicts little meaningful change in US-China policy in the short-term, largely because the Middle East will continue to monopolize the administration's attention. \"We're going to continue to focus on the Middle East at the expense of Asia-and Europe.\" Still, as Mearsheimer and others readily concede, the future of US-China policy is anything but clear. \"It's very early in the game, China is in the early stages of its rise,\" Mearsheimer says. \"This is kind of like looking at Germany in 1882, not Germany in 1912.\" Haass is somewhat more sanguine. (His new book, \"The Opportunity: America's Moment to Alter History's Course,\" is in part about the \"opportunity to integrate China into a US-led world order.\") Still, he agrees that it's too soon to make long-term projections. \"It's possible in 25 years we could wake up and we'll have a US-China Cold War. We could also wake up in 25 years and see the US and China selectively cooperate on various global and regional concerns just as they do now.\" \"History suggests,\" Haass goes on, \"that working out relations between a dominant power and a rising power always involves friction. It's almost like geology, when tectonic plates run up against one another. The potential is always there for friction, or worse.\"",
        "debiased_text": "In Singapore last Sunday, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld addressed an audience of Asian defense officials and military officers, stating that China's defense expenditures are higher than publicly acknowledged. He referenced a forthcoming Pentagon report estimating China's military budget as the third-largest globally and the largest in Asia. Rumsfeld questioned the rationale behind China's increased military investment, given the absence of threats to the country. His remarks align with recent heightened scrutiny of China by the U.S. government. The Bush administration has criticized China for currency valuation, market restrictions, and intellectual property concerns. In February, CIA director Porter Goss told the Senate Intelligence Committee that China's military modernization could affect the balance of power in the Taiwan Strait and pose risks to U.S. forces in the region. The administration has opposed European proposals to lift an arms embargo on China. A Pentagon report cited by Rumsfeld reportedly describes China's military in stronger terms than in previous years. Media reports indicate increased discussions in Washington about China's growing influence. Some analysts note similarities to the Bush administration's earlier skepticism toward China, while others caution against overinterpreting recent developments. Scholars such as Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution emphasize the ongoing need to assess China's role in global affairs. Richard Haass, former State Department official and current president of the Council on Foreign Relations, noted internal debates within the Bush administration regarding China policy. Early in the administration, China was labeled a 'strategic competitor,' but cooperation increased after the September 11 attacks and during Iraq-related diplomacy. High-level engagements, including visits by President Bush and then-Chinese President Jiang Zemin, signaled improved relations. Some analysts suggest that without former Secretary of State Colin Powell, administration figures like Rumsfeld may have gained influence. However, Professor Jonathan Pollack of the Naval War College observes that President Bush appears to recognize the importance of maintaining relations with China, particularly regarding North Korea's nuclear program. Frustration with China's approach to North Korea may partly explain recent U.S. criticisms. Pollack notes that U.S. policy toward China is influenced by multiple factors, including economic disputes unrelated to security issues. Observers like James Mann, author of books on U.S.-China relations, suggest concerns about China's expanding influence in East Asia have grown. Some scholars, including John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago, predict limited near-term changes in U.S.-China policy due to ongoing focus on the Middle East. Long-term projections remain uncertain, with possibilities ranging from strategic competition to continued cooperation. Haass and others highlight historical patterns of friction between established and emerging powers, drawing parallels to structural tensions in international relations."

        "title": "US condemns EU plan to lift arms embargo on China: [USA 2ND EDITION]; US condemns EU plan to lift arms embargo on China:   [USA 2ND EDITION ]",
        "original_text": "The US House of Representatives yesterday voted 411-3 to pass a resolution condemning the European Union's movement towards lifting its arms embargo on China. The resolution, which has symbolic rather than legislative impact, comes as the EU is adding the final touches to controversial plans to replace the embargo with what it says is a more transparent export system. However, the US insists the steps will not be enough. The issue is set to feature on the agenda of Condoleezza Rice, US secretary of state, when she travels to Europe this week. Washington alleges that lifting the embargo could destabilise the Taiwan Strait and put the US Seventh Fleet at risk. \"It is in this context that the EU's current deliberations on lifting its arms embargo on China are so outrageous,\" Tom Lantos, a Democrat House member, said yesterday. The EU says ending the embargo, which has limited practical effect, is a symbolic move in keeping with the growing partnership between Europe and China. European politicians such as Jack Straw, UK foreign secretary, add that a strengthened EU code of conduct on global arms sales could address US concerns. Ms Rice sounded a conciliatory note on the embargo, in a pre- trip interview with news agencies. \"We need to continue to discuss it . . . and to understand European motivations for wanting to go down this road,\" she said. But the revised code of conduct, which includes new rules on arms brokering and the transfer of software, was virtually agreed last year. The only reason it was not formally approved was that the UK wanted to wait until a transitional post-embargo export regime for China was agreed. This too is almost ready, although the EU will avoid any formal announcement until after President George W. Bush visits Brussels on February 21-22. The embargo is likely to be lifted in May or June, although the EU is also waiting for a gesture on human rights by Beijing. \"We understand where Europe is going and we disagree with that direction,\" said a US official. \"China is a player but we don't think we have to make sacrifices on values.\" The code of conduct is not legally binding, while the embargo, which was put in place by the EU in 1989, is interpreted differently by the EU's 25 member states. For example, Germany says it sells no weapons to China, while in 2003, the last year for which EU-wide data exist, France granted Euros 2m (Dollars 2.6m) in licences to export bombs, torpedoes, rockets and missiles to China and Euros 45m in licences for sales of military aircraft. The transitional scheme the EU is close to agreeing would increase transparency about arm sales to countries when an embargo is lifted. France had objected to increased disclosures about export licences, but now accepts this as a price of lifting the embargo. The transitional regime would also apply to Libya, which was the subject of an embargo until last year, and would be in force for five to 10 years. The EU and US are considering beginning a process of confidential consultations, involving a \"what bothers you\" list of proscribed weapons and technologies. Some EU officials add that the US is most interested in restricting technology transfers, which the arms embargo was never able to control. EU licences for arms exports to the Chinese mainland increased from Euros 54.4m in 2001 to Euros 416m in 2003, despite the argument that increased transparency would rein in arms sales. Quentin Peel, Page 13",
        "debiased_text": "The US House of Representatives passed a resolution yesterday by a vote of 411-3, formally expressing disapproval of the European Union's consideration to lift its arms embargo on China. The resolution carries no legislative weight. The EU is finalizing plans to replace the embargo with a new export control system that it describes as more transparent. The US maintains that these measures will be insufficient. This issue is expected to be discussed during US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's upcoming visit to Europe. The US has stated that lifting the embargo could impact stability in the Taiwan Strait and affect the US Seventh Fleet. The EU has indicated that removing the embargo, which it acknowledges has limited practical effect, would symbolize the growing partnership between Europe and China. Some European officials, including UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, suggest that an enhanced EU code of conduct on arms exports could alleviate US concerns. Secretary Rice stated in a pre-trip interview that further dialogue is needed to understand the EU's rationale. The revised code of conduct, which introduces new regulations on arms brokering and technology transfers, was largely agreed upon last year. Its formal approval was delayed as the UK sought alignment with a post-embargo export framework for China. The EU plans to delay any official announcement until after President George W. Bush's visit to Brussels in February. The embargo could be lifted between May and June, pending developments on human rights discussions with Beijing. A US official acknowledged understanding the EU's position while expressing disagreement. The EU's arms embargo, established in 1989, is applied inconsistently across member states. For instance, Germany reports no weapons sales to China, while France authorized €2 million in licenses for certain military exports to China in 2003, the most recent year with complete EU data. The proposed transitional framework would enhance transparency for arms sales to countries previously under embargo, including Libya, and would remain in effect for 5-10 years. The EU and US are exploring confidential consultations regarding restricted weapons and technologies. Some EU officials note that US concerns primarily focus on technology transfers, which the embargo did not regulate. EU arms export licenses to China increased from €54.4 million in 2001 to €416 million in 2003 despite transparency proposals."

        "original_text": "Tennis\nKEY BISCAYNE, Fla. -- Serena and Venus Williams have captured the prestigious Nasdaq-100 Open for four consecutive years and six of the last seven.\nBut rather than underscoring the strength of women's tennis in this country, it masks an alarming trend: the lack of young American talent moving up the female ranks behind them.\nThe Williamses, Lindsay Davenport, Jennifer Capriati and Chanda Rubin all cracked the top 20 as teenagers in the 1990s.\nToday, no American woman younger than 20 has a place in the top 100, and only three rank in the top 270, with 18-year-old Jamea Jackson of Atlanta the highest at No. 113. More ominous, there is not a future Grand Slam tournament winner in sight.\nBy comparison, there are nine teens in the top 50, led by Wimbledon champ Maria Sharapova of Russia at No. 3.\n\"It's pretty clear when you look at the rankings that there are gaps with the top U.S. players and others below them,\" said Jean Nachand, director of women's tennis for the U.S. Tennis Association.\nWhat's happened to the next generation of female stars?\nThe reasons are complicated. According to 23-year-old Serena, U.S. teens want immediate gratification, are too distracted by the glare of celebrity and aren't as hungry as the legions of Russians, Chinese and Eastern Europeans clogging the WTA Tour.\n\"Everyone's interested in becoming a pop star,\" the three-time defending Nasdaq-100 champ said this week. \"I think in some of these different countries they have different obstacles that maybe we don't have, unless you're from the urban area.\"\nTennis also has lost ground to other sports, a result of Title IX legislation, which has encouraged young girls to pursue everything from soccer to ice hockey in the hopes of earning college scholarships. Others say the decline can be traced to the social and financial aspect of girls team sports, which tend to be cheaper, more available and more likely to hook youngsters.\n\"In the Philadelphia area, no one is playing high school tennis anymore,\" lamented Pennsylvania native and tour veteran Lisa Raymond, who won two NCAA championships at the University of Florida.\nRaymond said Americans have it too cushy and aren't pushing each other the way the Russians are with the top players all vying to be No. 1.\n\"They will kick and scream and fight their way to make it out of Moscow,\" she said, \"whereas with the American girls, it's easier. If we don't win a tennis match, we'll go out that night and go to South Beach and hang out. Or Daddy will pay for this or that.\"\nThe spread of tennis academies across the globe has allowed players more opportunities for top-flight competition and training closer to home. For instance, 2004 U.S. Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia trains in Barcelona. Plus the advent of tennis as a medal sport in the Olympics has increased the reach and competition of the game.\nSome say the lack of up-and-coming U.S. women is simply part of a cycle. Even so, throughout the 1970s, '80s and '90s, one teen phenom after another continually replenished the U.S. pool, from Chris Evert to Tracy Austin to Andrea Jaeger to Davenport to, most recently, the Williams sisters. Not since Serena broke into the top 20 in 1998 has another teen done so.\nThe USTA's Nachand, for her part, said high-performance training centers in Carson, Calif., and Key Biscayne are helping bring more talent to the game. The USTA is working with coaches from across the country to identify talented kids ages 9-10 and bring them to the centers.",

Participation in tennis among young girls has also declined due to the growth of other sports supported by Title IX legislation, as well as the affordability and accessibility of team sports. \n\nLisa Raymond, a tour veteran from Pennsylvania, observed that American players may not compete as intensely as their international counterparts, citing differences in training environments. Globally, tennis academies have expanded, providing players with improved training and competition opportunities closer to home. Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia, for example, trains in Barcelona. Tennis becoming an Olympic sport has also increased its global reach. \n\nSome analysts view the current lack of emerging young American players as part of a cyclical trend. Historically, the U.S. produced successive teenage tennis stars from the 1970s through the 1990s, including Chris Evert, Tracy Austin, Andrea Jaeger, Lindsay Davenport, and the Williams sisters. Since Serena Williams entered the top 20 in 1998, no other American teenager has achieved the same. \n\nThe USTA has established high-performance training centers in Carson, Calif., and Key Biscayne to develop young talent. Nachand stated that the USTA collaborates with coaches nationwide to identify promising players ages 9-10 and bring them to these centers."

        "title": "Robin Cook: Europe's well-paid leaders have caused the crisis",
        "original_text": "A number of us from the pro-European wing of the trade unions and the Labour party got together this week for group therapy. Hilariously we had originally planned the meeting to decide how we would sell a yes vote in a British referendum that now lies buried beneath a mountain of French nons and Dutch nees. In the event our clandestine gathering in an attic room up a back staircase took on the character of an embattled resistance plotting how to fight back. At least we are spared another wasted year trying to excite the interest of the British public about the finer points of the 448 clauses of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's draft constitution. I always did have my doubts about how long I could keep passers-by in my local shopping mall in conversation on whether it was time for the council of ministers to move on from a six-month rotating presidency. There are many useful steps for the better in the new treaty and I have a lot of continental friends who have spent the best part of two years trying to perfect its text, but the harsh truth is that the whole exercise has been an extravagant diversion of energy, imagination and time that would have been far better put into addressing the legitimacy of the European project among the public. We have all behaved in a way that almost lives up to the caricature of Europe as an institution that exists for the perpetual extrusion of ever-longer treaties that meet the preoccupations of the political elites rather than the priorities of its peoples. It would be a strategic blunder if Tony Blair was to let the British presidency waste the second half of this year in scrabbling around in the rubble of the recent referendums to find what can be salvaged from the collapse of the constitution. The priority must be to move the debate about Europe away from process and on to outcome. This is all the more essential as process is about how top politicians arrive at communiques in exclusive summits, while outcome is about how it all benefits the lives of the public. There is an unhealthy tendency these days to regard a concern with the practical benefits to real people of European integration as some kind of sellout on the grand vision. This is not a perspective to which Jean Monnet and the founding fathers would have given house room. There could have been nothing more intensely pragmatic than where they started with the creation of a common market in iron and steel. If Monnet were to return now I suspect his first response would be delight that the seed which he planted has produced the largest, richest single market anywhere in the world, bigger even than the GDP of the US. His second reaction would be incomprehension that the current generation of politicians do not talk more about what this means to their public in terms of increased trade and jobs, and of greater competition that has halved the price of airline flights and telephone calls around the continent. It is commonplace to talk about a democratic deficit in Europe, but in truth the immediate problem in the present crisis is a leadership deficit. The referendum debacles catch Europe at what is possibly the first time in its history when all the leaders of the big four nations are serving out their time, waiting to be replaced. What Europe needs are credible figures with a political future who can convince the public that the European Union is a necessary, effective response to the pressures of a globalised economy. That must not be confused with turning Europe into the conduit by which those pressures are brought home most painfully to its people. There are too many people who believe they demonstrate they are modern by lecturing the workers on the need to work longer for less security and for poorer pensions. All too often they themselves turn out to enjoy well-paid jobs with good pensions and lifelong job security. It is for other people to make the painful adjustment to globalisation that they preach. If the European Union allows itself to be labelled as part of the forces of globalisation it is doomed to fail in any project to rebuild public support. There are warning signs from the recent referendum campaigns, particularly from the hostility of the young, that too many people already equate the European Union with the pressures that are eroding their job security and quality of life. The challenge is to persuade them that the European Union is an intelligent way of meeting those pressures by forging a continental economy on the same scale as the US or China. Those who are most worried about globalisation are the very people who should be most supportive of the European Union. If Tony Blair wants to use the British presidency to kick-start such a project to restore the credibility of Europe among its peoples, there are two changes of direction that would help. The first is to stop talking about economic reform as if it were a threat. The French and German public may go along with our economic agenda if we present it as the road to full employment and prosperity, but not if we constantly lecture them on the necessity of giving up their job security and letting deregulation open the window to the chill winds of laissez-faire competition. A touch of humility before embarking on these lectures would also not come amiss. Both France and Germany after all have much higher productivity and greater investment than ourselves and, despite our superior conviction that we know how to handle the global economy, they have big trade surpluses with it while we have a whopping deficit. The second is to stop standing in the way of the popular measures that do come out of Europe. Why should Downing Street make it an issue of principle that British workers be denied the European limit of 48 hours on the average working week, when they know it would be popular with the great majority of those who are forced to work excessive hours? Should it not be part of any progressive package of economic reform to remove one of the reasons why British business does not face up to poor productivity per hour? In return the left should resist the Newtonian dynamic of being anti-Europe because Tony Blair is pro-Europe. There is no point in complaining about George Bush if we do not create in a united Europe the one alternative powerful enough to offer another world vision. Anyone who doubts that should pause to consider the balance of forces at the forthcoming G8 summit, where any progress on Africa or climate change will only happen if European leaders put up a more united front than their peoples have over the past week. r.cook@theguardian.com",
        "debiased_text": "Members of pro-European trade unions and the Labour Party held a meeting this week to discuss strategies following the rejection of the European constitution in French and Dutch referendums. The gathering, initially planned to promote a potential 'yes' vote in a UK referendum, shifted focus after the treaty's rejection. The draft constitution, containing 448 clauses, had been under development for nearly two years. Discussions raised questions about whether efforts should prioritize addressing public concerns about the European project's legitimacy rather than technical treaty details. Some participants noted that current European leadership faces challenges as major nations await leadership transitions. The meeting also touched on how the European Union could focus discussions on outcomes benefiting citizens rather than institutional processes. Comparisons were made between current EU policies and the practical approach taken by early European integration founders. Data was cited showing the EU single market now exceeds the GDP of the United States. Participants discussed public perceptions that link the EU with globalization pressures affecting job security. Suggestions were made about presenting economic reforms positively and reconsidering opposition to certain EU employment policies. The discussion concluded with observations about European unity at international summits."

        "title": "China Drug Firms Consolidate; Stricter Beijing Rules, Foreign Rivalry Face Fragmented Industry; China Drug Firms Consolidate; Stricter Beijing Rules, Foreign Rivalry Face Fragmented Industry",
        "original_text": "Hong Kong -- CHINA'S HIGHLY fragmented drug industry, under siege from foreign rivals and new government quality standards, is entering a crushing round of consolidation. More than 3,000 domestic players compete in the $10 billion market, but none control more than a small share. \"In most industries [China has] national champions,\" says T.C. Chu, a director covering health- care for business consultants McKinsey & Co. in Hong Kong. \"But in pharma, they don't.\" That is starting to change as the Chinese government, eager to make its drug industry more competitive, enforces rigorous new quality controls. The tougher requirements, and rising competition from the likes of Pfizer Inc. and Novartis AG, are forcing smaller operations to shut down or fall prey to larger rivals. Those that remain, however, could prove a stubborn challenge to multinational drug giants eager to supply China's rising demand for pharmaceuticals. Under China's centrally planned economy, the health-care system was a decentralized tangle of local providers, hospitals and drug makers. That gave rise to thousands of tiny fiefdoms, each controlled by a single manufacturer. But in less than a year, the number of Chinese drug companies has fallen by more than a quarter, to about 3,500 from more than 5,000 in 2004, according to government figures. The tally is expected to keep dropping. \"There will be significant consolidation,\" says John Tang, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong. \"The majority of companies cannot survive.\" With their low budgets for research and development, China's pharmaceutical makers are in a different league from the multinationals, but they do enjoy certain advantages. Many Chinese companies not only produce the pills but also own the pharmacies where they are dispensed, as well as the distribution networks that deliver them to the hospitals, where nearly 80% of drugs are sold. In addition, Chinese companies can churn out generic versions of branded drugs for a fraction of their price. Because nearly all the Chinese companies lack a national footprint, some with monopolies in their local markets have begun banding together. Last year, more than a dozen pharmaceutical companies, including some of the nation's largest, began forming an alliance to produce a generic version of Pfizer's erectile-dysfunction drug, Viagra, according to a manager at one of the companies involved, Tonghua Hongtaomao Pharmaceutical Co. The move came after the Chinese government revoked New York-based Pfizer's patent in China. The company is appealing that decision. \"We'll be seeing many more alliances, particularly over particular drugs, and that will be a stepping stone toward deeper integration,\" says Gustav Ando, an analyst for Global Insight, an economic- forecasting firm in Waltham, Mass. Demand for drugs in China is poised to boom as household incomes across the country increase. The market grew by nearly a third last year and is on pace to become one of the top five markets globally in the next five years, by some estimates. Foreign players account for 10% to 20% of overall sales, depending on the types of medicines and ventures included in the count. But sales at the top-tier Chinese companies are growing faster than at Western ones, according to Fairfield, Conn., consultancy IMS Health Inc. \"They make us look small,\" says Andrew Howden, regional vice president in Asia for AstraZeneca PLC, the London drug maker. One of the few drug makers in China that have already achieved national brand status is Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co., which has an aggressive advertising campaign (it spends one billion yuan, or about $121 million, on television spots a year) and a sales force of 2,400 working with local distributors nationwide. Harbin is strong in a variety of products, from antibiotics to chemotherapy pain relievers. It also offers a variety of nutritional supplements, such as calcium and zinc, and a host of traditional Chinese medicines. The company is about to become more competitive, with a planned two billion yuan capital infusion from two foreign investors, Warburg Pincus of New York and Citic Capital of Hong Kong. That money will allow Harbin to expand its research-and-development efforts -- the company spends about 5% of revenue on R&D, exceptional for a Chinese drug maker yet just a third of what most multinationals spend -- and help it become predator rather than prey as the consolidation gets more ferocious. \"If we just grow with the market, the opportunity is huge,\" says Chang Sun, managing director and head of North Asia for Warburg Pincus. \"But because it is so fragmented, the potential is even greater.\" As the shakeout continues, Chinese drug companies also could become global exporters of cheap generic drugs. Some are already beginning to resemble standout Indian generics manufacturers such as Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd. when they were in their infancy years ago, according to Yehong Zhang, an analyst in Shanghai with IMS. To be sure, the Indian generics players that some Chinese companies emulate spent years perfecting the art of copying Western drugs, fostering sophisticated research operations and medicines. Meanwhile, Chinese drug makers have enjoyed decades of safe monopolies in their local markets. But Mr. Zhang maintains that \"down the road\" China's drug companies will become \"formidable competitors\" of the multinationals. \"Some of the big guys are becoming very concerned about them,\" he says. --- Henny Sender in Hong Kong and Ivy Zhang in Shanghai contributed to this article. --- Open Wide China accounts for only a small portion of global drug sales . . . 2004 sales by region",
        "debiased_text": "Hong Kong -- China's pharmaceutical industry, which includes numerous small-scale companies, is undergoing consolidation. The market, valued at $10 billion, has over 3,000 domestic companies, none of which hold a significant market share. According to T.C. Chu, a director at McKinsey & Co. in Hong Kong, China lacks dominant national players in this sector compared to other industries. This is changing as the government implements stricter quality standards to enhance competitiveness. These regulations, along with competition from international firms like Pfizer Inc. and Novartis AG, are leading smaller companies to close or merge with larger ones. The remaining firms may pose competition to multinational corporations aiming to meet China's growing pharmaceutical demand. Previously, China's healthcare system was decentralized under the planned economy, leading to numerous small, localized drug manufacturers. Government data shows the number of pharmaceutical companies has decreased from over 5,000 in 2004 to about 3,500, with further reductions anticipated. Goldman Sachs analyst John Tang predicts significant consolidation, stating many companies will not survive. Chinese firms generally have smaller R&D budgets than multinationals but benefit from integrated operations, as many own pharmacies and distribution networks. They also produce lower-cost generic versions of branded drugs. Some locally dominant companies are forming alliances; for instance, Tonghua Hongtaomao Pharmaceutical Co. and others collaborated to produce a generic version of Pfizer's Viagra after the Chinese government revoked Pfizer's patent. Gustav Ando of Global Insight expects more such alliances, which could lead to further industry integration. China's pharmaceutical market grew by nearly a third last year and is projected to become one of the top five globally within five years. Foreign companies account for 10% to 20% of sales, depending on product categories. However, leading Chinese firms are growing faster than Western counterparts, according to IMS Health Inc. Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co., a notable national brand, spends heavily on advertising and operates a large sales network. The company is expanding its R&D efforts with a planned $242 million investment from Warburg Pincus and Citic Capital. Chinese companies may also emerge as exporters of generic drugs. Analysts like Yehong Zhang of IMS note similarities between current Chinese firms and early-stage Indian generics manufacturers. Zhang believes Chinese companies will eventually become significant competitors to multinationals."

        "title": "Press review: The view from Beijing",
        "original_text": "As China's newspapers have observed in the run-up to next week's spring festival, their country and its citizens are on the move like never before. But the events of the past fortnight have proved one feature of national life is still stuck firmly in the communist dark age: draconian censorship of politically sensitive news. The biggest news story of the month - the death of the former prime minister Zhao Ziyang and the controversy over his funeral arrangements - has been notable by its absence from the Chinese press. Instead this week's pages have been filled with stories about the comings and goings of a population that has never travelled so widely or spent so freely, about economic growth that accelerated last year to 9.5%, and about figures showing China is now the world's third-largest trading nation. Before he was purged for expressing sympathy with the Tiananmen Square protesters, Zhao was hailed as one of the architects of Chinese economic reform. But his death on January 17 merited only a terse 60-word report by the Xinhua news agency, which was buried deep inside the few newspapers that dared to carry the news. Mainland TV and radio stations made no mention at all of Zhao's demise. Foreign satellite news reports were blocked and internet police erased any posting relating to the news on website chat rooms. In the 11 days since, there has been no domestic coverage of the mourning at Zhao's house or the protracted negotiations between his family and the government about his funeral eulogy. Given China's size, the news blackout has been frighteningly impressive. Instead the media have entered early into the festival mood. As well as the usual reports on the journeys more than 100 million people are making back to their home towns for Chinese new year, the papers have also covered the first non-stop holiday flights by mainland airlines to Taiwan. In a breakthrough for generally appalling cross-straits relations, the first of 48 chartered flights is scheduled to take returning Taiwanese businessmen from Beijing to Kaohsiung tomorrow. The Beijing Youth Daily, which recently became the first mainland newspaper to list shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, has led the excited coverage by devoting a full page every day this week to the preparations for the first flight. The paper said those on the flights - which are limited to Taiwanese people - can expect to drink from crystal glasses, be served by flight attendants who speak at least four languages, and enjoy in-flight entertainment in the Taiwanese dialect. Commentators on both sides of the strait have expressed cautious optimism about the arrangement. \"The chartered flights agreement will produce a positive effect in improving relations between Taiwan and the mainland, but the key for peace negotiations is still in the hand of [the Taiwanese president] Chen Shui-bian,\" said the news weekly Oriental Outlook. In Taiwan, the United News Daily - a critic of the president - said the flights demonstrated the need for pragmatism from both China and Taiwan. \"This agreement is not only about the convenience of business travellers, it is very meaningful for the relationship between the two sides ... Our government should not always put a priority on ideology when considering the cross-straits issue otherwise our economic development will be restricted and the region will be destabilised.\" The return of eight Chinese hostages from Iraq focused media attention on the risks arising from the country's growing role in world affairs. Like the cockle-pickers who died in Morecambe a year ago, the kidnapped men were from Fujian province - the main source of illegal migrants from China. The influential weekly 21st Century Business Herald carried an interview with a former hostage, who said he still believed working abroad illegally was the route to a better life. \"It's dangerous, but I will try and do it again if I can. My experience was the exception. Most people who travel overseas earn a fortune.\" One of those who is working abroad legally is the Manchester City footballer Sun Jihai, who was asked by Sports Weekly to comment on Ron Atkinson's joke about Chinese women being ugly. Sun summed up his feelings with one of the Chinese language's most colourful expressions: \"Atkinson is like a dog who can't give up the habit of eating shit.\"",
        "debiased_text": "Chinese media have reported extensively on domestic travel and economic activity ahead of the upcoming spring festival. Official reports highlighted that China's economy grew by 9.5% last year and noted the country's rise to become the world's third-largest trading nation. The death of former Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang on January 17 was reported in a brief 60-word announcement by Xinhua news agency, which appeared in limited newspaper coverage. Mainland broadcast media did not report on Zhao's passing. Foreign satellite news coverage of this event was restricted, and online discussions about it were removed. There has been no domestic media coverage of subsequent developments regarding Zhao's funeral arrangements. Meanwhile, media reports have focused on holiday travel, including over 100 million people returning home for Chinese New Year celebrations. Mainland airlines have initiated non-stop holiday flights to Taiwan, with the first of 48 chartered flights scheduled to transport Taiwanese businesspeople from Beijing to Kaohsiung. These flights, restricted to Taiwanese passengers, feature upgraded services including multilingual attendants and Taiwanese-language entertainment. Media outlets on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have reported on the flights, with some commentators noting their potential significance for cross-strait relations. Separately, Chinese media covered the return of eight Chinese nationals who had been held in Iraq, with one former hostage expressing continued interest in overseas work opportunities despite the risks. In sports news, footballer Sun Jihai responded to comments made by Ron Atkinson about Chinese women."

        "title": "Bush urges Opec to increase supply",
        "original_text": "George Bush today urged Opec to boost supply to keep petrol prices down as the US struggles with the after-effects of Hurricane Katrina. But the US president's appeals to the oil cartel were falling on deaf ears as Opec ministers, meeting in Vienna, expressed reluctance to take immediate action to increase oil production. Although there was talk of releasing an extra 2m barrels, the Opec president, the Kuwati oil minister Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah, made it clear the additional amount would be made available only when required. Oil prices have eased from a record $70.85 (£39) a barrel in the three weeks since Katrina. However, US light crude today rebounded $1.70 to $64.70 as another tropical storm threatened US Gulf energy facilities. Mr Bush said fuel disruptions triggered by Katrina had been addressed, \"but part of the cost of gasoline is the result of high crude oil prices, and one way to affect those prices is to conserve and the other way is to encourage increased supply\". The chancellor, Gordon Brown, representing the EU, last week called on Opec to release an extra 500,000 barrels a day. But most ministers in Opec - the source of more than one third of the world's oil - appear to favour no change in the current output. Several ministers said they were opposed to higher output quotas when global refining capacity was at full stretch and unable to process more crude. \"If nobody wants to buy it, why should we increase the output ceiling?\" said the Libyan energy minister, Fathi Omar Bin Shatwan. \"The problem is a shortage of refining capacity.\" OPEC production, including 2m barrels a day from Iraq, is already at a 25-year high of more than 30m barrels a day with ample inventories of crude. Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer and therefore the one with most clout, said it supported a ceiling hike but added that it did not see demand for more crude. Previous Opec increases have done little to ease fears over supply, and any increase is widely seen as meaningless because it merely ratifies existing production. In addition to concern about production stoppages after Katrina, prices were also driven higher by worries about instability in Iraq and the coming winter. However, Opec fears sharp price declines because high prices seem to have taken a toll on demand. Oil prices have risen more than 50% this year, driven by strong demand from the US and China. At current levels, prices have gone well past pec's official price band of $22-$28.",
        "debiased_text": "George Bush called on OPEC to increase oil supply to help stabilize gasoline prices amid ongoing effects from Hurricane Katrina. During a meeting in Vienna, OPEC ministers indicated no immediate plans to raise production levels. While discussions included a potential additional release of 2 million barrels, OPEC President Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah of Kuwait stated this would occur only if necessary. Oil prices, which had reached a record $70.85 per barrel after Katrina, declined over three weeks but rose $1.70 to $64.70 for US light crude due to concerns about another tropical storm impacting Gulf energy infrastructure. Bush noted that fuel shortages caused by Katrina had been mitigated but emphasized that crude oil prices remained a factor in gasoline costs, suggesting conservation and increased supply as solutions. Gordon Brown, representing the EU, previously requested OPEC to increase daily output by 500,000 barrels. However, most OPEC ministers, representing over a third of global oil supply, supported maintaining current production levels. Some ministers, including Libya’s Fathi Omar Bin Shatwan, cited limited global refining capacity as a reason against raising output quotas. OPEC’s current production, including 2 million barrels per day from Iraq, is at a 25-year high of over 30 million barrels daily, with sufficient crude inventory. Saudi Arabia, the largest oil producer, expressed openness to a production ceiling increase but noted no current demand for additional crude. Past OPEC output adjustments have had minimal effect on supply concerns, with increases often formalizing existing production levels. Factors contributing to recent price volatility include disruptions from Katrina, instability in Iraq, and anticipated winter demand. OPEC remains cautious about potential price drops, as recent high prices may have reduced demand. Oil prices have increased over 50% this year, driven by strong consumption in the US and China, surpassing OPEC’s stated price range of $22-$28 per barrel."

        "original_text": "Los Angeles -- DOZENS OF contestants gathered recently in a windowless room with crimson-felt walls, gold-trimmed mirrors and a leaky ceiling, hoping for a chance to be famous in China. Among them was Jennifer Johnston, a furniture seller fresh off the plane from Tucson, Ariz. She took the stage and sang her favorite karaoke song -- \"Tzee,\" or \"Chess Piece,\" a Chinese pop standard about a woman who is played by her lover like a pawn -- in front of a panel of stone-faced judges. \"This is an incredible opportunity,\" said Ms. Johnston, 26 years old, who speaks fluent Mandarin learned at school in Tulsa, Okla. Ms. Johnston was auditioning for \"Arts from Our Land,\" a massively popular show broadcast every year in China during the Lunar New Year holidays, celebrated this year in early February. \"Arts from Our Land\" is a talent show in which non-Chinese people show off their skill in Chinese language or arts. More than 100 million people are expected to tune in, roughly as many as watch the Super Bowl. This year, for the first time, Beijing TV has come to Hollywood to recruit contestants. Since its debut in 1995, the program has attracted more than 2,000 competitors from more than 40 countries. Traditionally, it tapped the pool of foreigners living in China, many of whom have achieved minor-celebrity status. The program draws heavyweight advertisers, such as Procter & Gamble Co. and Samsung Corp., who are eager to put their products before a mega-audience. To give the show more cachet, Beijing TV's bosses decided this year to hold auditions in the U.S, France and Japan. \"The idea is to make the show global,\" said show director Li Bei during her stop in Los Angeles. The competition is formidable. In addition to Ms. Johnston and her rendition of \"Tzee,\" Michael Grubman, a senior at the University of California, Los Angeles, performed on the qin (pronounced CHIN), an ancient and rare zither believed to be played by only 1,000 people in the world. John Savell, 26, did tai chi, the traditional Chinese shadow-boxing exercise, choreographed to the music of Icelandic rock band Sigur Ros. \"I like the ethereal sound of the band,\" he said. The Chinese government, which controls all television programming, is investing in the show with greater motives than merely promoting a cultural exchange. As China has opened up, its people have eagerly embraced Western pop culture, from Hollywood movies to hip-hop. Despite China's emergence as an economic superpower, there is a feeling that its traditions haven't withstood the test of modern times. \"Arts from Our Land\" helps send the message that \"Chinese culture is so powerful and seductive, even foreigners want to learn it,\" said Stanley Rosen, a professor at the University of Southern California. Perfect execution of Chinese acts by foreigners also serves to \"shame\" Chinese people into preserving their culture, according to the scholar of Chinese politics and culture. But for viewers in remote areas of China, who may have limited or no contact with non-Chinese, the foreigners are an entertaining oddity, one that the Chinese applaud rather than poke fun at. Indeed, in this sense, the show is the opposite of \"American Idol\"'s William Hung, who shot to fame because of his disastrous rendition of pop songs. Take the country-western guitar rendition of a folk song about China's Cultural Revolution, performed by anthropology professor Eugene Cooper. Donning jeans, leather vest and felt hat, he declared his love for China to the cameras in impeccable Mandarin then belted out a tune glorifying Mao Zedong, father of communist China. Afterward, Mr. Cooper said he signed up for the audition for \"the kick of it.\" Lauren Elliott, an African-American nurse with her hair in dreadlocks, performed a popular, old Cantonese tune, \"Fung Yu Tong Lo,\" about friendship and betrayal. She sprinkled in English verses, which she crooned to a rap beat. \"I am surprised at your proficiency in Cantonese,\" said one judge. Wowed by her stage presence, another judge declared, \"You are comfortable in your skin.\" In all, about 400 gao bizi -- a slang term for foreigner that means \"high nose\" in Mandarin -- are expected to compete in the talent show. Most contestants at the Hollywood studio were self-proclaimed Sinophiles who covet any measure of fame in China. Several of them allude to Mark Rowswell, a blue-eyed Canadian who has achieved near- cult status since mastering the ancient Chinese art of Xiangsheng, or comedic dialogue. Virtually unknown in his home country, Mr. Rowswell, known as \"Dashan,\" has become an advertising icon in China. As for the U.S. hopefuls for \"Arts from Our Land,\" they all have a shot at a few minutes of stardom, at least. Even if they appear only in the first round of the prerecorded show on Feb. 3, they will be seen by an audience larger than any they could hope to draw in the U.S. Only two Americans will win a trip to Beijing for the semifinals. The marathon talent show stretches to Feb. 11, when a winner will be announced. There is no cash prize, only a trophy and a certificate. In previous years, some finalists and winners launched show business careers, although none has become a huge celebrity. \"Let's face it, Americans who do this tend to be nerdy,\" said Michael Cherney, a visual artist, after demonstrating his talent for writing Chinese calligraphy, an art form included in the competition this year for the first time. Mr. Cherney learned that he was one of the two U.S. semifinalists. The other one is Mr. Cooper. But his country-style crooning about Chairman Mao won't be his ticket to fame in China. \"That is the song I do best,\" Mr. Cooper noted. But the state-run station told him to find a tune about a less-sensitive subject.",

        "title": "Campbell's cabinet shuffle: [Final Edition]",
        "original_text": "Two weeks after the election, the provincial capital is in suspended animation while Premier Gordon Campbell determines the shape of a second-term B.C. Liberal government.\nShould the loss of 30 seats mean a big shakeup? A smaller cabinet? Some lacklustre first-term ministers relegated to the backbench to make room for new talent? Will the line ministries be reorganized for the first time in four years? Senior civil servants shuffled as well? And what about changes in the premier's office?\nWill there be a new, centralized communications shop? In a squeeze, governments always put the blame on communications staffers and structures, even when the main fault is with the chief communicator.\nThe betting line is \"yes\" to all those questions. But each decision -- and many more -- needs the go-ahead from Campbell.\nEven the Opposition is waiting on the man. New Democratic Party leader Carole James is holding off appointing her shadow cabinet until she sees Campbell's revised ministerial lineup.\nThe B.C. Liberals say Campbell won't take the wraps off the new cabinet before the second half of June, a full month after voters rendered their verdict on his first term of office. Contrast that delay with the rapid response from British Prime Minister Tony Blair, when he was returned to office with a reduced majority May 5.\nThe votes were still being counted when Blair shuffled his senior ministers the morning after the election. Three days later, he changed the lineup of junior ministers as well. Before a week had elapsed, he'd announced a new emphasis on domestic policy-making and convened a special meeting of the party caucus to provide assurances he would be moving on. Blair had probably been anticipating those changes for weeks. He knew, going into the election campaign, that his government was headed for reduced circumstances.\nCampbell was less prepared for the magnitude of the setback on May 17. An optimist by nature, he didn't credit party insiders who warned as voting day approached that the Liberals would drop to 45 seats. He's also more methodical about making changes. Before taking office in 2001, he spent weeks reorganizing the government by shuffling index cards on a wall-sized display in his office.\nEven with that exercise behind him, the newly elected Liberals spent many more months in a so-called \"core review\" of every program, agency and Crown corporation. So he'll take time to digest the May 17 results, then match the talent pool with the new assignments for the second term.\nThe voters retired eight ministers; a ninth, Attorney-General Geoff Plant, will retire as soon as his replacement can be selected. But that shouldn't mean nine vacancies at the cabinet table. With a much smaller complement of government MLAs, there'd be no justification for another 27-seat ministerial behemoth like the one the Liberals took into the election.\nA smaller cabinet still needs to represent the whole province -- by region, gender, and ethnicity.\nCampbell short-shrifted those factors in his first cabinet, costing the government support in the early years of its mandate.\nThe balancing act won't be easy. The returning ministers number 18. But only four of the nine women at the cabinet table were re- elected. Only one of two Chinese-Canadian ministers and one of South Asian heritage survived. The returning Liberals include a dozen MLAs who've not yet been given a shot at a cabinet post. Several crafted impressive victories against an NDP-favoured tide in their regions.\nRegionally, the cabinet is skewed in favour of the Okanagan- Shuswap (five ministers), against the northwest and the southeast (none). There are six ministers from Lower Mainland suburbs south of the Fraser River, none from those on the north side.\nLastly, there is the problem posed by the newcomers. The Liberals elected 10 rookie MLAs, an unusually large number for an election where they also lost many seats. Most of them would probably be content with learning-the-rope assignments for the first half of their terms. But at least two have every reason to expect to be made ministers. The two automatics are, of course, Wally Oppal and Carole Taylor, both accorded \"star\" status by the premier during his pre- election recruiting drive.\nTheir elevation to what are expected to be senior posts will generate another question of balance for the Liberals. Taylor and Oppal represent adjoining ridings on the south side of Vancouver. They sit next door to the west-side ridings of Finance Minister Colin Hansen and the premier himself.\nIf Vancouver members hold down the top four spots at the cabinet table, the rest of B.C. could be feeling a little left out of this government.",
        "debiased_text": "Two weeks after the election, the provincial capital awaits Premier Gordon Campbell's decisions regarding the formation of a second-term B.C. Liberal government following the election results. The process will involve determining potential changes to the cabinet size, ministerial positions, and government structure. Opposition leader Carole James has delayed appointing her shadow cabinet until Campbell announces his new ministerial lineup. The B.C. Liberals have stated that the new cabinet will not be revealed before the second half of June. This timeline differs from British Prime Minister Tony Blair's quicker ministerial reshuffle after his May 5 re-election. Campbell is taking time to assess the election outcome and align available personnel with second-term responsibilities. Eight ministers were not re-elected, and Attorney-General Geoff Plant is set to retire once his successor is chosen. The cabinet will likely be smaller, given the reduced number of government MLAs, and will need to account for regional, gender, and ethnic representation. Eighteen ministers were re-elected, including four out of nine female ministers, one of two Chinese-Canadian ministers, and one of South Asian heritage. Twelve returning Liberal MLAs have not yet held cabinet positions. The new cabinet may also include two newly elected MLAs, Wally Oppal and Carole Taylor, who were prominent candidates during the election. Considerations around regional representation remain, as the cabinet currently includes more members from the Okanagan-Shuswap and Lower Mainland suburbs south of the Fraser River than from other areas."

        "title": "Destiny for the taking as Iraq braves bombs to vote",
        "original_text": "After the threats and the promises; after the bombs, assassinations and security clampdown; after the Sunni boycott and the Shia religious call to vote, the day of Iraq's first free elections in half a century dawned today over a country divided between fear and cautious optimism. Even as security forces sealed land borders and closed Baghdad airport, insurgents launched an audacious attack on the US embassy inside Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, killing two Americans and wounding four after nightfall yesterday. An eyewitness said the complex had been hit by a rocket, causing an explosion which could be heard across the city centre. The attack deepened fears of an insurgent blitz today, demonstrating their ability to strike at the heart of the interim government and US power base. More than a dozen polling stations were also attacked yesterday. Opinion polls have suggested a high turnout of some 14 million Iraqi voters, especially in the Shia and Kurdish areas, but fears persist of a widespread Sunni boycott - and of intimidation of those too frightened to risk the trip to the ballot box. The country's Sunni president, Ghazi al-Yawwer, said he expected 'a majority, up to two-thirds of eligible Iraqis' to vote but admitted fear of the bombers targeting polling stations would deter some. A suicide bomber yesterday struck a US-Iraqi security centre in the town of Khanaqin, north east of Baghdad. The US military said three Iraqi soldiers and five civilians were killed. Mortars hit a voting centre in the refinery town of Baiji, wounding four guards. Other sites were dynamited overnight. South of Baghdad, an Iraqi woman and her child were killed when mortar rounds aimed at an Ameri can base hit their home. And US troops killed two Iraqis in a car near Ramadi, according to witnesses. The circumstances were not immediately known. But as the blood flowed around Iraq, interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi urged Iraqis to defy 'our enemies [who] are trying to break us and to break our world'. He told his people: 'Participate in the elections whether they are inside or outside Iraq: Sunnis, Shias, Kurds, Christians.' In Baghdad, a hundred calls to prayer echoed from the mosques into empty streets yesterday as US helicopters and fighter jets thundered through the sky, and troops on the ground set up checkpoint after checkpoint, locking down the city with the concrete blast walls and rolls of razor wire. The people of Baghdad have been stocking up on food, water and fuel and spent yesterday waiting at home. Schools and offices were closed, few drivers dared venture out into the streets and the curfew was enforced from 7pm. The elections have been overshadowed by a boycott by the Sunni Muslim minority of around 20 per cent which once dominated the country, and a threat by largely Sunni insurgents to unleash a torrent of attacks when Iraq's 5,000 polling centres open early today. But outside Baghdad and the 'Sunni Triangle', despite the violence, curfews and strict prohibitions on travel, Iraqis were awaiting the vote with keen anticipation. In perhaps two-thirds of the country voting should be able to take place relatively unhindered and Iraqis will select a 275-member National Assembly that will nominate a president and two vice-presidents, who in turn will select a prime minister and government. They will also be voting in provincial elections - the two races combined seeing some 19,000 candidates stand for election by proportional representation. In Hai al-Jihad, a violent suburb of Baghdad, militants put up their own propaganda. One poster shows a picture of an American soldier grabbing an Iraqi around his head. Above it is the sarcastic caption: 'In the shade of democracy we will vote with full freedom.' And the country's split is clear in places like the Shahbandar cafe in the old city, a meeting place for writers and intellectuals. 'I cannot vote. Our country is under occupation,' said Ali Hussein Alwan, 53, who sat wearing an old grey pinstripe suit and a red wool hat. 'All of us believe in elections but not this way.' On another bench sat Amar Abdul Amir, 43, a poet from a town in southern Iraq, drinking tea from a small china saucer. 'These elections are like a birthday for Iraqis. I am eager to vote,' he said. 'We are never scared. We have a bright future ahead of us. We want to build our country but when we are ready to protect ourselves we want the Americans to leave. This country is for Iraqis only.'

A rocket strike was reported by an eyewitness, with the explosion audible across the city center. More than a dozen polling stations were attacked in the lead-up to the election.

Residents stocked supplies and remained indoors as curfews were enforced from 7 p.m. Sunni insurgent groups had threatened attacks during the elections. Outside Baghdad and the Sunni Triangle, many Iraqis prepared to vote despite travel restrictions. The election will select a 275-member National Assembly to form a new government, alongside provincial elections with approximately 19,000 candidates. In Hai al-Jihad, militants displayed anti-election propaganda. At Baghdad's Shahbandar café, opinions differed among patrons—some opposed voting under current conditions, while others expressed optimism about Iraq's future.

        "original_text": "Peter Mandelson, the European Union's trade commissioner, yesterday resisted pressure to introduce immediate restrictions on Chinese textile imports, insisting that inconclusive trade data meant the EU could not justify curbs for the time being. Concerns about Chinese clothing flooding European and American markets have been triggered by the worldwide lifting of textile quotas on January 1. The US administration has taken the lead in preparing itself to counter an influx from China. But the European Commission yesterday showed it wanted to be able to follow suit when it adopted guidelines to help determine how it would apply safeguard measures on Chinese imports. The EU's executive body has managed to collect relevant customs data on textile imports since January from only 20 of the 25 EU member states. Cyprus, Malta, Finland and Ireland have provided no figures, while those supplied by the UK were yesterday deemed \"unusable\" by a Commission official. Mr Mandelson said the data collected so far provided \"a mixed picture\". \"I do believe in vigorous and rapid action when it is supported by the facts. It is too early to judge what market disruption will arise.\" Mr Mandelson has been caught in an internal European dispute about how to respond to China's booming textiles sector, which represents a fifth of the Dollars 400bn world market. His cautious stance is certain to anger France and Italy, which have led demands for immediate curbs to protect struggling European textile companies. However, Mr Mandelson also stressed that he was in principle ready to pull the sanctions trigger, although a move is now unlikely before June. He charged that it was \"unfair\" of Sweden and other critics of potential curbs to suggest such a response would demonstrate growing European protectionism. He noted safeguard measures would be temporary and fully in line with China's terms of accession to the World Trade Organisation. \"We should not confuse protection with protectionism,\" he said. Meanwhile, US textile producers yesterday said they would ask their government to impose new quotas against China on 14 additional categories of products, including dressing gowns, cotton and fibre sweaters and brassieres. The request, which will trigger an investigation by the US government, follows a Commerce Department announcement on Monday that it would launch its own investigations into imports of cotton shirts, trousers and underwear. If enacted, the quotas would limit China to 7.5 per cent annual growth in sales in the US in those products. The actions now cover products that accounted for more than half of US textile and apparel imports last year, and could increase pressure on China to negotiate a deal to restrain its exports to the US.",

        "title": "Minister warns BAE off transatlantic merger",
        "original_text": "Defence Minister Lord Drayson has questioned whether a transatlantic merger between BAE Systems and a major US contractor would be in the national interest. Drayson, who last week launched the government's Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS), plotting the future for UK arms manufacturers, said he believed any deal would undermine Britain's research and skills base in the long run. He said: 'The problem is that over time we have to refresh intellectual property and innovation. It is important that you are doing these things here. If you don't do these things you see a loss of skills and capability. That reduces options for us in terms of our armed forces.' The government has a 'golden share' in BAE, and so could ultimately block a deal. Drayson's remarks will surprise market observers who believe BAE has come close to deals with Boeing and General Dynamics - and may yet strike a deal with a US group - although BAE says such a move is not a short-term priority. Last week BAE chief executive Mike Turner welcomed the DIS, saying that without it, and without recently improved relations with the MoD, BAE would not have remained in the UK. 'Without these changes in procurement and DIS I think it would have been very difficult to see how BAE Systems, the one real prime systems integrator, could have remained in our country,' he said. Asked if a move to the United States by BAE would have caused a problem, Drayson said: 'That would.' Drayson said that he was not worried about BAE expanding its activity in the US. Indeed, he believes expansion into the biggest and most profitable market in the world is vital, pointing to BAE's acquisition of armoured vehicle maker United Defence Industries. But he is concerned about the US attitude to sharing vital technology and information on programmes in which the UK is involved. The most pressing case is that of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), the world's largest defence programme. The UK is planning to buy 150 planes, and has already committed £2 billion to the programme, being led by Lockheed Martin of the US. BAE has a major role in the programme. However, the MoD is concerned that without an agreement on technology transfer, the UK will be unable to upgrade the planes independently in future. Drayson said: 'We want to make sure that we have the necessary IP [intellectual property] to be able to maintain these.' He added that the government had a Plan B, thought likely to involve using Harriers and, possibly, adapted Europfighter aircraft. 'We want JSF STOVL [vertical take-off] on our aircraft carrier, and that is plan A. We also have a plan B - that would not be JSF. It is essential for us as a nation to have operational capability that we need in the future.' Separating those areas of capability that must be retained in the UK from those that can be done 'offshore' was the purpose of the DIS paper. Drayson identified nuclear submarine building, biological and chemical capabilities, integrating complex ship programmes, such as the carriers, and the development of a new generation of unmanned fighter aircraft as essential. He said that to maintain these industries, investment and companies must be attracted to the UK defence sector. However, some capabilities would not be vital, and would decline, for example building warship hulls. Drayson said complex programmes such as carriers and the Type 45 destroyer should be maintained. But smaller ships could be made elsewhere. VT Group has already proposed that some of the 11 vessels in the Mars auxiliary programme could be made in China or eastern Europe. Drayson maintained that workforces could be redeployed from traditional manufacture to centres for upgrading JSF and Typhoon, along with developing unmanned fighters (UAVs). He claimed that across the industry, employment could rise from its present 35,000. BAE, however, said that in the long run there would be reductions because UAV programmes would require less development and manufacturing work.",
        "debiased_text": "Defence Minister Lord Drayson has addressed the potential implications of a transatlantic merger between BAE Systems and a major US defense contractor. Speaking after the release of the government's Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS), which outlines future plans for UK arms manufacturers, Drayson stated that such a deal could affect Britain's research and skills base over time. He emphasized the importance of maintaining intellectual property and innovation domestically to preserve defense capabilities. The UK government holds a 'golden share' in BAE, giving it the authority to block any merger. Market analysts had speculated that BAE was close to agreements with Boeing and General Dynamics, though BAE has stated that such a move is not an immediate priority. BAE's chief executive, Mike Turner, recently welcomed the DIS, noting that improved relations with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and changes in procurement policies were key factors in the company remaining in the UK. Drayson clarified that while expansion into the US market is important for BAE, concerns remain about technology sharing, particularly regarding the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program. The UK has committed £2 billion to the JSF, but the MoD seeks assurances on technology transfer to enable future independent upgrades. Drayson mentioned an alternative plan (Plan B) involving Harriers and possibly modified Eurofighter aircraft if technology-sharing issues persist. The DIS outlines which defense capabilities must remain in the UK, including nuclear submarines, chemical and biological defenses, complex shipbuilding programs, and unmanned aircraft development. Drayson noted that while certain sectors may decline—such as warship hull production—efforts will focus on reassigning workers to areas like JSF and Typhoon upgrades. BAE has indicated that while some job growth is possible in the short term, long-term reductions may occur due to decreased manufacturing needs for unmanned systems."

        "original_text": "A not-so-funny thing happened on George Bush's trip to Europe last week. He went to ease the tension over the war in Iraq, but wound up laying bare a new dispute over China. Bush urged the European Union to reconsider plans to lift a 15-year-old arms embargo on Beijing, and the leaders of Europe politely but clearly declined. Once again, Washington and Brussels hold deeply conflicting views of an ambitious power. Only imperial Iraq was a Saddam Hussein fantasy. China is clearly an emerging superpower. The question that now divides the West is: what kind of superpower? This split could be very dangerous, and not only to transatlantic relations, because the Chinese regime looks invulnerable to change. The question of how Beijing will exercise its growing strength, and how the West should respond, will only grow in importance. And the debate in Brussels last week seemed to crystallize two very different answers. \"There's a sense that we're just talking past each other,\" says one U.S. diplomat. To Europe, China is a one- dimensional \"trade-driven soft power without a military threat,\" says Willem van der Geest, head of the European Institute for Asian Studies in Brussels. So why not sell the country weapons? While the American view also emphasizes China's economic rise, there is an influential camp (headquartered in the Pentagon) that sees Beijing as a potentially aggressive empire, probing to extend its commercial reach worldwide and its political and military influence from Thailand's Kra isthmus through the China Sea to Taiwan. Accelerating China's military buildup with Western arms could hasten the day when Beijing may act on its vow to reunite with its \"renegade province\" by force, if necessary. Urging Europe to maintain the embargo last week, Bush spoke of Americans' \"deep concern\" that resuming weapons sales \"would change the balance of relations between China and Taiwan.\"",

This is particularly remarkable because it is a large primary school, rather than secondary school, and for that reason today it will host the schools minister Derek Twigg as he launches the first national strategy for e-learning. Anna Hassan, its headteacher, says that the school's 100-plus computers are particularly useful for her pupils because English is a second language for more than 70% of them. Using computers makes lessons more visual, she says, which helps pupils communicate better. \"It's about personalised learning,\" she explains. \"The success is in the development of each individual child. ICT gives us more options to find the best way to teach them and it helps provide a broader range of sensory stimuli and access learning in a way that best suits them.\" Teachers benefit from being able to easily access resources online and use sophisticated software to create lesson plans and track pupils' progress - which also saves them valuable time, Ms Hassan says. And pupils' parents benefit too. Millfields is an extended school, meaning it provides services to the local community, such as adult learning and, in particular, ICT training. Parents often learn from their children, who have been reared on a diet of hard drives and floppy disks. \"The majority of our parents don't have computers at home,\" says Ms Hassan. \"We have computer suites for them to use. The dream is that parents will be able to tap into what we do. Once they have learnt how to use the computers they can use it to understand what the pupils are doing.\" The school is also linked, via Unicef, to schools in Africa and China and undertakes joint projects, whereby pupils exchange details about their schools, communities and homes. \"I can't imagine what I did without e-learning when I was a classroom teacher,\" says Ms Hassan. \"E-learning is the future. But our children use computers from nursery. I've had to learn everything and go on training, but they pick it up so rapidly. It's natural to them.\"",

        "original_text": "The US is again calling on China to shift to a more flexible currency regime. But how much of an impact would a stronger renminbi have on the bilateral trade imbalance? The correlation between real exchange rates and exports is diluted by China's role as an assembly line. Cars, telephone handsets and even Barbie dolls are made with imported components, so the renminbi-denominated element is small. Labour-intensive exports would remain competitive, as it will take more than currency appreciation to bring Chinese wage bills into line with US ones. Equally, Chinese imports are less a function of cost. Asian consumers have every incentive to spend - cheap money, abundant liquidity - but they remain net savers. China's slowing imports demonstrate the effectiveness of a government-dictated slowdown in domestic construction. A stronger renminbi would, of course, go some way to reducing the US deficit with China; Goldman Sachs estimates that a 10 per cent appreciation of the real exchange rate would cut export volumes by 15 per cent over time. But there are strings attached. US companies are among those benefiting from China's low costs - and foreign-invested companies still account for more than half of China's exports. The US bond market, partially anchored by Asian central bank buying, would also be vulnerable. The US should be careful what it wishes for.",
        "debiased_text": "The US has reiterated its call for China to adopt a more flexible currency system. Analysts are examining the potential effects of a stronger renminbi on trade imbalances between the two nations. China's position as a manufacturing hub complicates the relationship between exchange rates and exports, as many products assembled in China contain imported components with minimal renminbi-denominated value. Export sectors reliant on labor may maintain competitiveness, since currency adjustments alone would not equalize wage differences between China and the US. Meanwhile, Chinese import trends reflect domestic economic policies more than cost factors, with recent slowdowns linked to government measures regulating construction activity. Economic modeling by Goldman Sachs suggests a 10% increase in the real exchange rate could eventually decrease Chinese export volumes by 15%. However, such adjustments could also affect US corporations benefiting from Chinese production costs, as foreign-invested enterprises generate over 50% of China's exports. Additionally, the US bond market, which receives substantial investments from Asian central banks, might experience disruptions from significant currency shifts."

The talks have been stalled since the communist North walked out of the previous round of negotiations last June, accusing the US of \"hostility\" and \"insincerity\". Pyongyang rejected Washington's demands for it to begin dismantling its nuclear weapons in return for food aid and other assistance. It said it feared a US invasion if it agreed to scrap its existing weapons. The North agreed to return to the talks only after being assured that the US recognised its sovereignty. Earlier this month, it said it would resume the six-nation negotiations, and today's announcement confirms talks will begin on July 26. The previous three rounds of discussions - which began in 2003 - lasted for several days, but failed to result in any breakthrough. South Korea is pressing for this set of talks to be more flexible and to last longer - possibly for up to a month or more. In a statement, the South Korean foreign ministry said Seoul planned to \"play a progressive and active role in making substantial progress ... for resolution of the North Korean nuclear problem\". China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the US have sought to use the meetings to persuade the North to abandon its nuclear weapons. The nuclear crisis began in late 2002, when US officials accused North Korea of running a secret uranium enrichment programme. In February this year, Pyongyang publicly said for the first time that it had nuclear weapons, and it has since made moves that would allow it to harvest weapons-grade plutonium from its main nuclear reactor. Some experts believe North Korea has enough plutonium to make at least six bombs, but it has never tested any weapons that would confirm its potential arsenal. Analysts argue that the prospects of progress at next week's talks are not good. Some believe the six-nation negotiations are going nowhere, and have called on Washington to hold direct talks with Pyongyang. In Tokyo, the Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, today said his country remained committed to normalising diplomatic relations with North Korea. Mr Koizumi visited Pyongyang three years ago, when the two countries agreed to reconcile, but relations have since stalled over the nuclear issue and Tokyo's demands for more information about the fate of several Japanese allegedly abducted by North Korea. The South Korean president, Roh Moo-hyun, said yesterday that the US held \"the final key\" to a solution at the talks. Earlier this month, South Korea revealed that it had offered energy aid to the North as an incentive for it to give up its nuclear weapons. The offer - of 2,000 megawatts of electricity and half a million tonnes of grain - was praised by the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. Washington has said it would offer diplomatic recognition and trade to North Korea only after international inspectors verified that the country had completely dismantled its nuclear programme. The North Korean regime's main newspaper said yesterday that Pyongyang and Washington should agree to coexist and respect each other at the restarted talks. \"The talks should not be ones for their own sake,\" the Rodong Sinmun newspaper said. \"One side should not be allowed to use the talks for achieving the sinister purpose of disarming the other party.\" Meanwhile today, in a move likely to anger North Korean officials, campaigners were to meet at a Washington conference on North Korean human rights. The conference, organised by the non-partisan Freedom House group, has been partially funded by the US government. Washington officials had been expected to appoint a special envoy for North Korean human rights, who had originally been expected to appear at the conference. However, an announcement about an appointment has been delayed because of anxieties over Pyongyang's possible reaction and how that could affect the nuclear talks. There was a sign of improved relations between North and South Korea yesterday when fibreoptic communications cables across the border were joined. Linking Seoul and Pyongyang, they will be used next month for a first video reunion of families torn apart by the 1950-53 Korean war. They were one of a series of measures agreed during cabinet level talks between North and South Korea last month.",
        "debiased_text": "North Korea will resume international nuclear arms talks in Beijing next week following a pause of over a year, according to an announcement by South Korea's foreign ministry. The negotiations had been on hold since the previous round ended in June of last year. The talks will begin on July 26, with participation from six nations. Previous rounds of discussions, which started in 2003, lasted several days but produced no significant agreements. South Korea has expressed its intention to actively participate in seeking progress toward resolving nuclear-related issues. China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the United States have been involved in these discussions aimed at addressing North Korea's nuclear program. The current situation traces back to 2002 when U.S. officials raised concerns about North Korea's nuclear activities. In February of this year, North Korea publicly acknowledged possessing nuclear weapons. Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi stated Japan's continued interest in normalizing diplomatic relations with North Korea, though progress has been complicated by nuclear concerns and unresolved issues regarding Japanese citizens allegedly abducted by North Korea. South Korea has proposed energy assistance to North Korea as part of efforts to address the nuclear issue. Separately, a Washington conference on North Korean human rights is scheduled to take place, organized by Freedom House with partial U.S. government funding. Meanwhile, North and South Korea have taken steps to improve communications, including connecting fiberoptic cables across their border to facilitate family reunions."

        "title": "China learns to scale the wall",
        "original_text": "The Chinese have come up against the reality of doing business in the west - and so far proved themselves enthusiastic exponents of global capitalism. Their bona fides were enhanced last week by the long-awaited revaluation of the currency but in several other situations they also showed that they have mastered the intricacies of the business world. Haier, the country's leading white goods manufacturer, decided against blowing its millions in a bidding war for US Hoover owner Maytag; CNOOC, the state oil company, is still playing a canny game in the auction for California's Unocal; and yesterday saw two of the country's biggest industrial centres, Shanghai and Nanjing, vying head to head for MG Rover, Britain's bankrupt carmaker. They are learning quickly to adapt to the ways of the west. Differing political climates undoubtedly make things more difficult for the Chinese, at least in the US. While the British government sent delegations to plead with the Chinese to rescue Rover, the Americans are determined that none of their assets should fall into Chinese hands - so much so that the Bush administration has ordered a review of its Chinese trade policy in response to vociferous opposition to CNOOC's bid for Chevron. That is despite the fact that, unlike Chevron, it has promised to keep on all Unocal's employees; the two companies already have a joint venture and the majority of Unocal's assets are in Asia - belying the critics who accuse the Chinese of stealing America's oil. Political opponents have made much of the fact that CNOOC's parent is 70 per cent owned by the state, which is supplying extremely cheap finance for the deal - although it would then be refinanced at commercial rates . 'It clearly creates a perception of unfair bidding advantage if the company is perceived to be receiving free money from it backers,' said one investment banker. Such preferential financing arrangements are common, according to Andrew Huntley of Business Development Asia, an associate of Close Brothers, who has worked extensively on Chinese transactions. 'State-owned enterprises always get preferential financing ... if they want a big acquisition overseas. There is no shortage of dollars in China.' That makes it all the more surprising that difficulties with financing were being blamed for delays in the two Chinese bids for MG Rover. Observers say such problems may have more to do with their respective partners than the Chinese themselves. And anyway the Chinese soon came up with the cash. They have also been enthusiastic followers of financial advice, of which there is no shortage on the big deals. Goldman Sachs, which is advising CNOOC and worked with Lenovo, China's biggest PC manufacturer, on its acquisition of IBM's PC business, and has moved all its investment banking team from Hong Kong to Beijing. Further down the pecking order, however, Chinese companies often try to do the deals themselves. 'Their culture is not to use professional advisers,' said Huntley. 'If they did, it could help them to do better.' Chinese companies will want to send teams of people to a target company and spend a week getting to know all its operations, people and products and will then take a month to decide whether or not to get involved. 'A lot of transactions are done in a controlled auction process, where Close Brothers are mandated to sell a subsidiary or a business from a private equity house,' said Huntley. 'There are always Chinese buyers interested, but it is difficult for them to keep up with the pace. They are often unsophisticated and slow.' Unsophisticated or not, Chinese companies have managed to consummate a number of deals. Overall, Dealogic calculates that Chinese companies have made 173 acquisitions worth $10.8 billion since 2001. Many of these have been in the resources sector as Chinese companies seek to secure supplies of the oil, metals, coal and other minerals needed to keep its manufacturing boom going. That is the motivation behind CNOOC's bid for Unocal. China Minmetals Corporation recently bought Canadian copper producer Noranda and there have also been a number of coal acquisitions in Australia and resources deals in Africa. Outside resources, the motivation is different. China is growing rapidly, but its big companies face the same pressure as western ones: large market shares, fierce competition and thus limited opportunities for domestic expansion. But Chinese companies not only lack the brands to take their businesses international, they also lack the management expertise in running global businesses. That was recognised by Lenovo, which was determined to keep on the management of the IBM personal computers business - and will move its own headquarters from Beijing to New York - in recognition of the fact that it lacks the skills to integrate and manage an international business. And, while it is keen that its own name become as recognised in the west as it is at home, it clearly recognises the cachet the IBM brand carries in the computer market. Lenovo can take credit for recognising its weakness. John Wong, vice-president of Boston Consulting Group in Hong Kong - and previous head of its China office - says management in China is 'today not very good'. Many companies were either started by a single entrepreneur or have evolved from state-owned enterprises, such as Haier or TCL, the television manufacturer which last year acquired a majority stake in French TV manufacturer Thomson Electronics. 'Their corporate structures are quite different to the way businesses are managed in developed world markets, with their standard corporate processes,' Wong says. 'In China, management - within organisations, but especially across businesses - is done by personal relationships. \"I know someone at X and they can deliver on time\". Professional management is relatively new. All entrepreneurial companies, even in state-owned enterprises, are professional managers in a sense, but senior executives were often appointed because they were members of the communist party. The idea of a professional manager who is not Chinese, is not a member of the family, and is likely to walk away if a better package becomes available is difficult for them to get used to.' Although Haier blames its decision to pull out of the bidding for Maytag on price, Maytag's managers may also have been reluctant to recommend the Chinese bid, with the risks of having owners whose culture they did not really understand, in preference to one from rival Whirlpool, from the same Anglo-Saxon stock. The cultural differences clearly increase the already considerable risks of doing cross-border deals. The rumour mill suggests TCL is finding the integration of Thomson's television business challenging and there is already considerable interest in how Lenovo will fare in bedding down its IBM purchase. It is worth remembering that the last time there was such a political storm in the US over foreign purchases of its assets, Japanese companies were in the firing line, with accusations that their property purchases in New York would mean all Manhattan would be turned Japanese. In fact, New York remains as American as ever, partly because many of the properties were repurchased by American banks when the market turned sour, leaving the foreigners bankrupt or nursing huge losses.",
        "debiased_text": "Chinese businesses have been engaging in international acquisitions and adapting to global market practices. Last week, China's currency was revalued, a move anticipated by markets. Several Chinese companies have been involved in significant international business activities: Haier, a major appliance manufacturer, chose not to participate in a bidding war for Maytag, the US owner of Hoover. CNOOC, a state-owned oil company, continues to participate in the auction for Unocal, a California-based energy firm. Additionally, Shanghai and Nanjing, two major industrial centers in China, have expressed interest in acquiring MG Rover, a bankrupt British car manufacturer. \n\nIn the United States, political considerations have influenced reactions to Chinese acquisitions. The US government has initiated a review of trade policy with China following opposition to CNOOC's bid for Unocal. Critics have raised concerns about CNOOC's state ownership and financing terms, though such arrangements are not uncommon in large overseas acquisitions by state-owned enterprises. \n\nChinese companies have completed numerous international deals, with Dealogic reporting 173 acquisitions worth $10.8 billion since 2001. Many of these involve natural resources, aimed at securing materials like oil, metals, and coal to support domestic manufacturing. Outside the resources sector, Chinese firms face challenges such as limited brand recognition and management expertise in international markets. For example, Lenovo, which acquired IBM's PC business, plans to retain IBM's management and relocate its headquarters to New York to address these gaps. \n\nManagement practices in Chinese companies often differ from those in developed markets, with a reliance on personal relationships rather than standardized corporate processes. Cultural differences can complicate cross-border deals, as seen in cases like TCL's acquisition of Thomson's television business. Historical parallels exist, such as the scrutiny Japanese companies faced during their acquisitions in the US in the 1980s, though the long-term impact of those deals varied."

        "title": "Frane Kane: Who will bring the high street to book?",
        "original_text": "It all gets serious this week in the most interesting takeover contest that has hit London for some time - Waterstone's owner HMV's £96.4m offer for rival bookselling chain Ottakar's. After a couple of weeks of posturing - with authors, publishers and Ottakar's itself all rounding on HMV chief exec Alan Giles (who also runs Waterstone's) they now have to get down to the job of trying to block, or at least hinder, Giles's carefully manoeuvred bid. That is not an easy task. HMV has come up with knockout financial terms, trumping the management buyout led by James Heneage. With 30 per cent of the shares already committed to HMV by the two largest shareholders, Morley and Framlington, it looks near impossible to engineer a more tempting offer. So maybe the 'Stop HMV' movement should concentrate on ameliorating the consequences. There is leverage here that might win a hearing from the Office of Fair Trading. The OFT might be persuaded, as author Anthony Beevor has forcefully argued, that the real competition concern is not the 24 per cent combined market share of the UK book market, but the 50 per cent plus that Waterstone's would have of the core 'stockholding' bookstores. (To you and me, that means ignoring Tesco, WH Smith and any other 'pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap' outfit.) If those terms of reference were adopted, the OFT might be tempted to put some stringent conditions on the takeover. Giles has a good counter-argument here - it would make no sense, he insists, for Waterstone's to continue the 'dumbing down' process that has undoubtedly taken place in British book-selling, because then we would be taking on the likes of Tesco in marketing books in volume and on price. True enough. He is also on strong ground when it comes to the technological expertise HMV already has in Epos and stock control, and which Ottakar's admits it would have to expensively replicate if it survived. Both publishers and retailers have horror stories to tell about the dangers of new technology initiatives in a consumer-oriented business. But I have a feeling the OFT would be very willing to listen to submissions from the authors and publishers about the huge power Waterstone's buyers and marketing men would have after a takeover. It is easy to paint Waterstone's chief buyer Scott Pack, and his team of 10 assistants, as modern versions of the old Soviet literature censors. Unfair, but Pack and his team would have enormous power. This is what publishers and authors fear most, and it is where they should concentrate their fire with the OFT. If the watchdog can be persuaded to attach firm undertakings on book selection and promotion - perhaps insisting on separate buying departments within the new company - it might just sweeten the pill enough to make it acceptable. Perhaps, in an age when the industry might often be called 'Starbooks', it all doesn't matter very much. After all, Lynne Truss made a huge bestselling success of a book about punctuation, of all things, and she was actively promoted by Waterstone's. Or then again, as Beevor would probably argue, maybe that's the whole point. A little meeker maybe, Mary backs China If I were a Chinese internet entrepreneur, I wonder how I'd feel about the news that Mary Meeker, the American investment analyst once dubbed the Queen of the Net, was turning positive on my industry. Meeker, who did her bit to inflate the internet bubble for Morgan Stanley in the 1990s before it all hit the fan, has stuck her neck out with a selection of Chinese web stocks that she thinks are worth attention by western investors. There are some caveats, but the message from Meeker is that these companies are the gems of the sector, indeed the country. Her reasoning is so simple that it seems conclusive: China is the fastest growing economy in the world; the internet is the engine for growth in the second phase of the new paradigm; therefore, get in quick. Bet the ranch on such oriental winners as Netease, Ctrip.com and Tencent, and you'll make your fortune. Existing shareholders will probably love her for it. Back in dotcom boom days, the Meeker seal of approval was almost a guarantee on its own that the shares would soar. There is sure to be a frenzy to buy the stocks, even if as a hedge, by foreign investors who fear they have already missed the China miracle. But her recommendation is not untarnished. She fell from grace when the bubble burst in 2000, and there will be suspicion about her tips, especially in such a volatile and unregulated market as China. Still, it will do no harm for Morgan Stanley, which is investment bank adviser to Microsoft, Google and eBay. Meeker's expertise in the Chinese market will be invaluable when these giants want to do some serious M&amp;A business in the East. And isn't that the point of the exercise after all? Will Chapter 11 fit in Walsh's bulging in-tray? Willie Walsh's in-tray is getting higher and heavier by the day. By the time the new British Airways chief executive gets behind the desk at the beginning of next month, he'll probably find it's being used as a runway chock for a 747. On top of the Gate Gourmet mess, there is the move to Heathrow's terminal five, an impending confrontation with the unions (an annual event) and rising oil prices. Last week, another huge file hit the Irishman's desk, marked 'Pending - American chapter 11 abuse'. This is the most complex issue of all but, if Walsh gets it right, BA, and the global airline industry (non-US, that is) will thank him. Bluntly, the American government allows big businesses to go bankrupt, without any long-term financial consequences, and re-emerge in better shape. Last week Delta and Northwest became the latest members of the American corporate fat-farm. Great for them, bad for us. They can carry on flying on a totally artificial basis, while BA, Virgin and other properly run airlines must obey the laws of financial gravity. Walsh's first call on 1 October should be to Transport Secretary Alistair Darling, to enlist the help of Whitehall, and Brussels, in this unequal battle.",
        "debiased_text": "This week marks a significant development in the proposed £96.4 million acquisition of bookselling chain Ottakar's by HMV, the owner of Waterstone's. Following initial discussions, stakeholders including authors, publishers, and Ottakar's management are now focused on addressing the bid. HMV's financial terms have surpassed a competing management buyout offer led by James Heneage. With 30% of Ottakar's shares already committed to HMV by major shareholders Morley and Framlington, securing a more favorable offer appears challenging. Regulatory scrutiny may center on market competition, particularly Waterstone's potential dominance in stockholding bookstores, which could prompt conditions from the Office of Fair Trading. HMV emphasizes operational synergies, including existing technological systems, as rationale for the deal. Separately, analyst Mary Meeker has identified Chinese internet stocks, including Netease, Ctrip.com, and Tencent, as attractive investments, citing China's economic growth. Meeker's past influence during the dot-com bubble lends both credibility and caution to her recommendations. Meanwhile, incoming British Airways CEO Willie Walsh faces multiple challenges, including labor negotiations, terminal relocation at Heathrow, and the industry-wide impact of U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections utilized by carriers such as Delta and Northwest. Walsh is expected to engage UK and EU officials on this issue."

        "original_text": "Hugo Chávez knows how to wind up the US government. His latest wheeze - selling discounted home heating oil to chilly residents of Massachusetts - follows his offer to help victims of Bush administration bungling over Hurricane Katrina. But the Venezuelan president's tweaking of Washington noses extends beyond weather-related crises. Mr Chávez, chief rainmaker of Venezuela's so-called Bolivarian revolution, was busy yesterday persuading Colombia to build a pipeline to its Pacific coast. That could increase Caracas's oil exports to China at the expense of the US, which depends on Venezuela for roughly 15% of its foreign oil. Earlier this week Mr Chávez celebrated a tractor deal with Iran. He said mischievously that he looked forward to further bilateral \"technology transfers\". Mr Chávez is also using Venezuela's oil bonanza, fuelled by high world prices, to promote his populist agenda in Washington's Latin American backyard. Preferential oil deals have been offered to up to 20 countries. And at last month's Summit of the Americas in Argentina Mr Chávez successfully led opposition to a US-backed regional free trade pact. When Mexico's president, Vicente Fox, objected, he branded him a \"lapdog of American imperialism\". US discomfiture does not stop there. It claims Venezuela's arms purchases from Russia and elsewhere are \"exporting instability\". Particular concern centres on Mr Chávez's support for leftwing forces in Colombia, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Bolivia, where Evo Morales, a Chávez disciple, is tipped to win next month's presidential election. \"Morales is my friend, another great guy and an Indian leader,\" Mr Chávez told the Washington Post in September. \"D'you want me to support the extreme right? I am a revolutionary. I have to support the leftwing movements in Latin America. We have to change Latin America.\" George Bush, nicknamed \"Mr Danger\" by Mr Chávez, put it another way after the failed summit: Latin America must choose between a \"vision of hope\" (represented by the US) and those who sought \"to roll back the democratic progress of the past two decades\". Hyperbole aside, Mr Bush may have a point. The garrulous, hyperactive Mr Chávez is wildly popular with the poor of Venezuela's urban slums. His anti-American rhetoric has facile appeal in a region ravaged by the discredited \"Washington consensus\" on neo-liberal reform. But critics say he is an opportunistic showman lacking firm ideological conviction and bent on undemocratic self-aggrandisement. Venezuela's opposition parties and media had been browbeaten into impotent subservience, reported Alma Guillermoprieto, a regional expert writing in the New York Review. Particularly pernicious was the use of voting records to deny Chávez opponents public sector jobs and government benefits, she said. Venezuela was deeply divided and its politics were almost hallucinatory. \"In Caracas today it often seems as if there were no issues, only bilious anger or unconditional devotion - or gasping bafflement - all provoked by the president,\" Ms Guillermoprieto said. Love him or hate him, Mr Chávez is impossible to ignore. Thirty years ago the US might have silenced him one way or another, but that time in Latin America has passed. Despite loose talk of coups and assassination, there seems to be no stopping El Presidente - and no end to the baiting of Mr Bush.",
        "debiased_text": "Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez has recently implemented several policies affecting international relations. Venezuela is providing discounted home heating oil to residents of Massachusetts. This follows previous offers of aid to victims of Hurricane Katrina. Venezuela has also been negotiating with Colombia to build a pipeline to its Pacific coast, which could facilitate increased oil exports to China. The U.S. currently imports approximately 15% of its foreign oil from Venezuela. Additionally, Venezuela signed a tractor agreement with Iran this week, with Chávez mentioning potential future technology transfers between the two countries. Venezuela has offered preferential oil deals to up to 20 countries and opposed a U.S.-backed free trade agreement at the Summit of the Americas in Argentina last month. During the summit, Chávez referred to Mexican President Vicente Fox as a 'lapdog of American imperialism.' The U.S. has expressed concerns about Venezuela's arms purchases from Russia and other countries, stating they may contribute to regional instability. The U.S. has also noted Venezuela's support for left-wing movements in Colombia, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Bolivia, where Evo Morales, a political ally of Chávez, is a leading candidate in the upcoming presidential election. Chávez has publicly stated his support for left-wing leaders in Latin America. After the Summit of the Americas, U.S. President George Bush commented that Latin America faces a choice between democratic progress and alternative visions. In Venezuela, Chávez maintains significant popularity among lower-income groups. Critics argue his policies have weakened democratic institutions and suppressed opposition voices. Reports indicate that opposition parties and media in Venezuela face restrictions, and some claim public sector opportunities are influenced by political affiliations.

        "original_text": "Increases in levels of obesity will cause deaths from diabetes to rise by 25%, a report warns today. The World Health Organisation said millions of lives and billions of pounds could be saved if action was taken in the UK and worldwide to tackle chronic disease. The WHO report, Preventing Chronic Diseases: A Vital Investment, concluded that efforts to prevent illnesses such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes could save the lives of 36 million people worldwide who would otherwise be dead by 2015. In the UK alone, 84% of deaths in 2005 will be from chronic diseases - amounting to 488,000 people. The report sets a new global goal to reduce the projected trend of chronic disease death rates by 2% each year until 2015. As well as saving millions of lives, such a reduction would also help world economies by cutting the cost of treatment and lost productivity caused by premature deaths. The WHO said an extra 2% annual reduction in chronic disease death rates in the UK would result in an economic gain of £1.14bn over the next 10 years. It said the vast majority of chronic diseases were caused by a small number of known and preventable risk factors, the three most important of which are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and tobacco use. The report said 80% of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes and 40% of cancer could be avoided through healthy diet, regular physical activity and avoiding tobacco use. The report focused on nine countries - Brazil, Canada, China, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, the United Republic of Tanzania and the UK. The WHO estimated that over the next 10 years, almost five million people in the UK will die from a chronic disease. The report said that deaths from chronic disease in the UK would decrease by around 0.8% in the next decade. But some chronic diseases will increase - most markedly, it said deaths from diabetes will increase by 25%. The WHO said the UK had already made good progress in reducing deaths from chronic disease, estimating that from 1970 to 2000, 3m heart deaths were averted in this country. But the costs to the UK from chronic disease remain high, the report said.",

        "original_text": "Speculation about an imminent revaluation of China's renminbi against the US dollar has reached fever pitch. An erroneous report on Wednesday on the English-language website of the People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, did nothing to soothe traders' nerves, briefly weakening the dollar and boosting tradeable Asian currencies. Genuine pressures for revaluation also persist. Above all, with Congress in a protectionist mood, the US administration insists that Beijing should move immediately to a more flexible currency regime. What should be done? The first priority is to eliminate the spurious arguments. US anguish over its bilateral trade deficit with China is not a good reason for a stronger renminbi. There is no reason for bilateral trade to balance. Equally, China's assertions that it cannot revalue under pressure, for fear of seeming weak in the face of foreign demands, do not justify maintaining the status quo if the economic arguments point to a currency shift. The next priority is to assess the better arguments. Against revaluation, some argue that the current account surplus is still smaller as a share of gross domestic product than the US deficit. Furthermore, a revaluation would be pointless if it were, say, 5 per cent. This would have little impact on Chinese trade or the politically sensitive US deficit. It would also encourage speculators to bet on a second upward movement. But if the change was too big it might have a destabilising effect on China's trade and even push the country into deflation. In favour of revaluation, however, China continues to accumulate huge quantities of foreign exchange. The country's current account, which was once barely in overall surplus in spite of the imbalance with the US, is now growing rapidly: the International Monetary Fund forecasts it at 4.2 per cent of gross domestic product this year. Moreover, China also receives massive inflows of foreign direct investment. The long-term basic balance (the sum of the current account and the FDI inflow) will be more than 7 per cent of GDP this year. In addition, because it is pegged to the dollar, the renminbi has declined against other currencies such as the euro. At the very least, a move to a currency basket or some other more flexible system would limit the renminbi's future overall decline in the event of a further dollar decline. On balance, the case for a sizeable revaluation is strong. But it must be delivered in the right domestic and international context. At home, China needs to find ways to promote domestic demand without another round of excessive investment and bad debt. Moreover, China must not move alone. Adjustments in exchange rates and in the balance between domestic spending and output must also occur in other surplus countries. Not least, the US must play its part by reducing the large fiscal deficits the Bush administration has so sedulously created.",
        "debiased_text": "Discussions about a potential revaluation of China's renminbi against the US dollar have intensified. On Wednesday, an incorrect report on the English-language website of the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, caused temporary fluctuations in currency markets, briefly weakening the dollar and strengthening certain Asian currencies. Meanwhile, underlying pressures for currency revaluation remain present. The US administration has urged China to adopt a more flexible exchange rate system, particularly as US Congress has shown increased interest in protectionist measures. Several arguments exist regarding renminbi revaluation. On one hand, some analysts note that China's current account surplus represents a smaller percentage of GDP compared to the US deficit, suggesting that a modest revaluation might have limited impact on trade balances. They also caution that a significant revaluation could potentially affect China's trade stability and risk deflation. On the other hand, China's foreign exchange reserves continue to grow. The International Monetary Fund projects China's current account surplus to reach 4.2% of GDP this year. Additionally, China receives substantial foreign direct investment, bringing the projected basic balance (current account plus FDI) to over 7% of GDP. Since the renminbi is pegged to the dollar, its value has declined against currencies like the euro. Some economists suggest adopting a more flexible exchange rate system could mitigate further depreciation if the dollar continues to weaken. For any currency adjustment to be effective, analysts suggest it should be implemented alongside domestic measures to stimulate demand in China without excessive investment, as well as corresponding economic adjustments in other surplus countries and fiscal policy changes in the US."

        "title": "China Buys American ; Is CNOOC's bid for Unocal the act of an aspiring oil major, or a true threat to U.S. energy supplies?: [Atlantic Edition]; China Buys American; Is CNOOC's b id for Unocal the act of an aspiring oil major, or a true threat to U.S. energy supplies?:   [Atlantic Edition ]",
        "original_text": "Fu Chengyu says Americans won't fear his company, once they get to know it better. Fu is CEO of the China National Offshore Oil Co., which recently placed an unsolicited bid to buy Unocal of California for $18.5 billion. By far the largest Chinese bid for an American company, the move stirred fears in Washington that CNOOC is the spearhead of a Chinese campaign to secure world oil reserves, at U.S. expense. As legislators lobbied a reluctant White House last week to block the deal, Fu compared the backlash to America's misplaced fear of Japan in the 1980s. \"Personally I think that the Chinese are being misunderstood all the time,\" he says. \"They have one heart, two eyes. They are not monsters.\" Fu insists his company is \"quite different\" from other Chinese state firms, with more independence from Beijing. One of the big three Chinese oil companies, CNOOC is far more nimble than the other two, both behemoths with tens of thousands of employees in factory campuses that include hospitals and schools. CNOOC is younger (established in 1982 at the beginning of China's market reforms), leaner (only 2,524 employees) and more worldly. Fu received a master's degree from the University of Southern California and speaks the lingo of global financial markets in fluent English. Yet one is left with the impression that he doth protest his independence too much. Fu insists he is the main force behind the Unocal deal, acting not as a state agent, but purely to \"add value for our shareholders.\" The state, however, owns 70 percent of CNOOC. As head of the corporation's Communist Party chapter, Fu reports to the government. And while he says his financing comes mainly from \"commercial banks,\" CNOOC would borrow most of the $16 billion it needs to complete the deal from its state-run parent company and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. Jason Kindopp, an analyst for the Eurasia Group in New York, sees CNOOC at the forefront of Beijing's strategy to secure oil supplies by \"building up national- champion oil firms that are capable of competing head to head with Western supermajors.\" There is nothing necessarily wrong with that. China is already the second largest oil-consuming nation after the United States. With its economy growing at an average of 9 percent a year, Beijing's push to secure energy supplies makes perfect sense. To many industry officials, who actually owns oil companies is irrelevant. Oil is sold on an efficient and stable global market, in which supplies go to the highest bidder. Hypothetically, in a severe crisis state-owned giants could funnel oil to their domestic customers at low prices, but the gain would be offset by lost sales on the world market. The response from skeptics is that China is already acting out what Kindopp calls an \"aggressive economic nationalism,\" cutting deals with rogue oil states that others shun, particularly Sudan, and overpaying for oil. Exhibit A is the price CNOOC offered to pay for Unocal: the $18.5 billion bid trumped an earlier one from Chevron of Texas by $2 billion, and was viewed by most analysts as excessive. Yet China is not the only nation playing hardball in the jittery oil markets. Lin Boqiang, energy economist at the Asian Development Bank, points out that almost half of the major players in the global oil market are at least partly owned by governments. CNOOC \"is not even a big firm. It couldn't dominate anyway,\" Lin says. \"The reason it becomes such a big issue is that it comes from China.\" As a relative newcomer to both the world oil markets and the game of international mergers and acquisitions, \"it's just too early to tell what China's true intentions are,\" says Frank Verrastro, an energy analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. For his part, Fu says it's \"partly true\" that the Unocal deal is about securing oil supplies, but insists China has no intention of hoarding resources. CNOOC's main aim, he says, is \"to grow into an international company.\" Indeed, some analysts see this as simply the latest in a series of attempts by China to raise its global-market cachet by buying famous brands, like Haier's recent offer to buy appliance-maker Maytag. In the short term, at least, Washington's fears do appear overblown. The basic concern is that CNOOC would divert a major source of oil supplies from the United States to China. But Unocal is only a medium-size oil company, too small to move markets. Only a small fraction of its oil goes to the U.S. market now, and CNOOC pre- emptively promised to maintain that flow, even before the backlash reached full boil. In fact, more than half of Unocal's reserves are in Asia, and are promised in long-term supply contracts, some of which don't expire for decades, mainly to Indonesia and Thailand. China's foreign policy has focused on courting these neighbors as allies and trading partners. It's unlikely Beijing would risk its emerging status as a diplomatic leader in Asia by breaking the oil contracts. No matter what, U.S. oil supplies are not at risk. Nor is critical U.S. technology, as some in Washington fear. Kindopp points out that CNOOC is about to get equally advanced offshore-drilling technology in a deal with Brazil, rendering this threat moot. Even if blocking the Unocal deal would serve no strategic purpose, there is no question that CNOOC has become a company to watch as one of the powerful new Chinese players in global markets. It has hired Public Strategies, a Texas company with close ties to the Bush White House, to handle PR in the United States. Fu says he is \"comfortable\" that a federal review of the deal now underway by an interagency committee on foreign investments in the U.S. will prove \"satisfactory\" for CNOOC, and that he understands the negative reaction in Washington. \"I think that it's natural because they never knew about CNOOC, they never knew about Mr. Fu and they never knew how the Chinese run their businesses,\" he says. As China's thirst for oil continues to grow, one thing is clear. More and more Americans are going to find out about all three.",
        "debiased_text": "Fu Chengyu, CEO of China National Offshore Oil Co. (CNOOC), stated that Americans may view his company differently upon further familiarity. CNOOC recently submitted an unsolicited $18.5 billion bid to acquire California-based Unocal, marking the largest Chinese offer for a U.S. company to date. This proposal has drawn attention in Washington, where some lawmakers have expressed concerns about potential impacts on U.S. energy security. Last week, legislators urged the White House to review the deal, prompting Fu to compare the reaction to U.S. apprehensions about Japan during the 1980s. Fu emphasized that CNOOC operates with greater independence compared to other Chinese state-owned enterprises. Established in 1982, CNOOC employs 2,524 people and is considered more internationally oriented than China's other major oil firms. The company has proposed borrowing $16 billion for the acquisition, primarily from its state-owned parent company and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, though Fu maintains the bid aims to create shareholder value. Industry analysts note that CNOOC's bid exceeds Chevron's earlier $16.5 billion offer for Unocal. Approximately half of Unocal's oil reserves are located in Asia, with existing long-term supply contracts to countries including Indonesia and Thailand. A U.S. interagency committee is currently reviewing the proposed acquisition for potential national security implications. CNOOC has engaged Texas-based Public Strategies, a firm with reported connections to the Bush administration, to manage its U.S. public relations efforts."

        "original_text": "The International Monetary Fund is worried that global growth is becoming too reliant on the performance of the US and Chinese economies, according to a report yesterday. While the Chinese government is seeking to slam the brakes on the country's soaring infrastructure spending, the treasury secretary, John Snow, described the US economy as resilient and dynamic. According to today's edition of the German newspaper Handelsblatt, the IMF's forthcoming World Economic Outlook report will warn of increasing risks to global growth if the US and China slow down at the same time. \"Global growth is to an inappropriate degree linked to the United States and China,\" the IMF report will say when it is published next month. \"The eurozone and Japan, which together have about one-fourth of the world's gross domestic product, have once again disappointed. Thus the risks are increased that there could later be a sharp downturn especially if the United States and China are hit with economic slowing.\" On Saturday the Chinese premier Wen Jiabao said that the government was seeking to restrict the growth in spending on fixed assets to 16% - down from 25% in 2004. Workers have been told to expect smaller pay increases. As China seeks to put the brakes on its economic expansion Mr Snow was bullish in his assessment of the strength of the American economy despite the renewed strength of the oil price over the last month. Although he acknowledged that energy prices were \"way too high\" Mr Snow said they were not in a danger zone as far as the US economy was concerned. \"The American economy is so strong, so robust right now that we have blown right through these very high energy prices. \"The American economy is very resilient, its very adaptive, its very dynamic, but clearly these energy prices create headwinds.\"",
        "debiased_text": "The International Monetary Fund has expressed concerns about global growth becoming increasingly dependent on the economic performance of the US and China, according to a recent report. The Chinese government is implementing measures to reduce infrastructure spending growth, while US Treasury Secretary John Snow characterized the US economy as strong and adaptable. The IMF's upcoming World Economic Outlook report, as cited by German newspaper Handelsblatt, will highlight potential risks to global growth if economic slowdowns occur simultaneously in both the US and China. The report states: 'Global growth is disproportionately linked to the United States and China.' It further notes that the eurozone and Japan, which collectively account for approximately one-quarter of global GDP, have not met expectations, potentially increasing the risk of a significant economic downturn. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao announced plans to limit fixed asset spending growth to 16%, a reduction from 25% in 2004, with corresponding adjustments to worker compensation. Meanwhile, Secretary Snow acknowledged current high energy prices but stated they have not reached levels that would jeopardize the US economy, describing it as currently resilient and dynamic despite these economic factors."

        "original_text": "A China National Offshore Oil Corporation oil rig in the Bohai sea. Photograph: Reuters Two high-profile takeover attempts of US companies by Chinese firms have hit the buffers. Haier, a Chinese conglomerate, has abandoned its $1.28bn bid for Maytag, after the maker of the iconic Hoover vacuum cleaners decided to accept a rival offer from Whirlpool. Meanwhile, CNOOC, the state-owned oil company, has seen its $18.5bn offer spurned by Unocal, a midsize independent oil firm based in California. Unocal has decided to accept an offer from Chevron, America's second largest oil company, even though that bid is lower at $17bn. In a takeover battle, the company with the higher bid usually wins. But the fact that CNOOC is Chinese has stirred up all sorts of fears. For some members of Congress you would think that the Chinese dragon is about to gobble the American eagle. Some members of Congress see CNOOC's bid for Unocal as part of a broader strategy by China, still officially a communist country, as a bid to hoard energy supplies before they run out. Another concern is that the US might unintentionally hand over technology or assets of military value. The fears about any takeover of US assets is somewhat misplaced given China's willingness to buy up enormous amounts of US government bonds. In soaking up dollops of US debt, China helps the Federal Reserve to keep American interest rates low, sustaining high levels of American consumer spending. Yet, members of Congress are not up in arms about this form of dependence. Ambivalent US attitudes towards China are hardly surprising. While the two are locked in a tight economic embrace, the White House sees China as a possible security threat, with Taiwan a possible flashpoint between the two countries. Max Boot, writing in the Los Angeles Times, posits that the bid for Unocal falls into the category of \"resource warfare\", an attempt by the Chinese security apparatus to infiltrate US hi-tech firms and defence contractors. For Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist, Unocal is a side issue. If China wants to overpay for a second-tier US energy company, that's China's business, he argues. More important for him is how the US and China manage the massive imbalances in their currencies. The US wants China to raise its currency so that it buys more and sells less to the US. But China relies heavily on exports to maintain strong economic growth and provide jobs for those migrating to the cities from the countryside. Set against the bigger picture, Unocal seems pretty small beer.",

Unocal, a California-based independent oil firm, opted for a $17 billion bid from Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, despite CNOOC's higher offer. Some U.S. lawmakers expressed concerns about CNOOC's bid, citing potential national security implications and China's energy procurement strategies. Meanwhile, China remains a significant holder of U.S. government debt, which influences U.S. interest rates and consumer spending. The U.S. and China maintain close economic ties, though geopolitical tensions persist, particularly regarding Taiwan. Analysts have differing views on the implications of the Unocal bid, with some framing it within broader discussions of economic competition and currency imbalances between the two nations."

        "original_text": "Less than half of companies surveyed in southern China's export manufacturing hub are planning to increase wages to attract and retain workers despite a worsening labour shortage, according to a government poll. Only 40 per cent of the companies surveyed by the Guangdong Statistics Bureau in late 2004 said they would consider lifting salaries this year. Of these, 74.8 per cent said they would keep the wage rise to 5 per cent or less. The bureau polled 329 companies with more than 50 workers in the Pearl River delta region, which produces about a third of China's exports. A rise in agricultural incomes and an expansion of economic opportunities in inland provinces last year has contributed to a shortage of migrant workers in the Pearl River delta. Economists warn the shortage could push up wages and in turn the cost of production, potentially driving facto-ries out of the region. In its report, the bureau said it expected the labour shortage to worsen this year. It estimates the region needs at least 1m more workers; a central government report last year put it at 2m. Among the bureau's recommendations were an increase in minimum wage levels and worker rights' protection. The bureau, however, does not set policy. Chinese migrant workers are often denied the privileges of other residents because of the country's household registration system. Critics, including some inside the government, have argued their poor treatment and low wages have fuelled the labour shortage. Cities in the Pearl River delta are starting to respond. Dongguan, a big export manufacturing hub, will raise its monthly minimum wage from Rmb450 to Rmb574 (Dollars 69, Euros 52, Pounds 36) next month. Guangzhou, Foshan and Shaoguan have also lifted their minimum wage levels. A survey by the Yangcheng Evening News,anewspaper based in the Guangdong provincial capital of Guangzhou, released yesterday found that a majority of factories in the delta planned to relax rules to cut the number of punishments and fines on workers in an effort to reduce labour turnover.",

        "title": "Bird flu in Vietnam",
        "original_text": "Our car rumbles beside glistening rice paddies and through Vietnamese villages one house deep. We pass a duck pond, chicken soup shacks, egg sellers, goose-down plumpers, makeshift poultry slaughterhouses snicking and chopping. Improvised electric plucking machines thrum, their stiffened rubber fingers snatching the feathers from broken-necked fowl. Unwanted butchers' ooze mingles with rainwater and sluices along a communal sewer. Drums and cymbals crash all around as children crowned with red rooster feathers press their faces to the taxi windows. Tomorrow is the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, Tet Trung Thu, the mid-autumn festival when farmers celebrate gathering in the harvest with sweet moon cakes and fables. This year is especially auspicious because Tet Trung Thu falls in the Year of the Rooster, an event in the calendar that resonates in a country founded on poultry. The chicken is king in Vietnam, and the casual visitor to villages such as this, in the northern province of Thai Binh, in the flood plains of the Red River, east of Hanoi, would never guess that they are on the frontline of a titanic microbiological war. At least three-quarters of all ducks and a quarter of chickens here are now host to a mutable and deadly form of avian influenza which Dr David Nabarro, the UN's newly appointed coordinator for avian and human influenza, warned in September was capable of killing up to 150 million people in a pandemic that \"could happen at any time\". Nabarro was accused of alarmism, but his fear is rooted in critical new evidence emerging from the north of Vietnam which has become a breeding ground for the bird flu virus, thanks to fenceless, free-range rearing, communal live markets and back yard slaughterhouses which place people close to the flock and expose birds to anything that flies by. Since it was first detected here in December 2003, H5N1, to use the scientific shorthand, has quickly spread to South Korea (in December 2003), Japan, China and Thailand (January 2004), Indonesia (July 2004), Cambodia (February 2005) and North Korea (March 2005). By July this year, the virus was in Laos and the Philippines, and spanned the whole of Asia. Earlier this year, it spilled towards Europe, spreading along migratory superhighways after infecting 184 species of wild birds that nest in the remote lakeland of Qinghai, in north-western China. Russia and Kazakhstan reported bird flu in late July; Mongolia and Tibet in early August. That month, following fears that the virus had crossed the Urals, the Dutch and German governments ordered all poultry to be brought indoors, while ornithologists advised the British government that infected wild birds might land in Norfolk. H5N1 shot up the UK risk assessment table to the highest priority. However, for all of these apocalyptic stories, as long as bird flu remains in poultry in its current form, it represents a threat primarily to those who farm or slaughter fowl. The critical phase that presages a pandemic is when the virus mutates, becoming readily transmissible between humans. This is what experts think happened 87 years ago when a similar strain of bird flu - misleadingly known as Spanish influenza - engulfed the world with catastrophic consequences. Tissue samples from the time, rediscovered in the Royal London hospital by John Oxford, professor of virology at the London School of Medicine, showed the 1918 pandemic was probably caused by avian influenza that leapt from poultry kept in British army camps on the western front in winter 1916. Within two years, the virus had mutated, enabling it to pass between soldiers as easily as the common cold, killing more than 40 million people. The current bout of bird flu in northern Vietnam has begun to mutate in a similar way, and the critical phase may have started. At least eight human clusters have been discovered there this year; a number of the victims had no contact with diseased poultry and are likely to have been infected by sick siblings, friends or in hospital. As this human-friendly strain becomes more efficient, it will spread around the world as fast as the strain now endemic in waterfowl. The first sign that the virus strain had mutated came when international investigators discovered it had leapt the species barrier. Most viruses are unable to adapt to the cellular structure of species other than the one in which they first evolve. However, bird flu quickly learned to reconfigure itself. First, in August 2004 in China, it hit pigs, whose immune system is closely related to humans'. It moved on to tigers and leopards (October 2004), killing 23 in a central Thailand zoo, then, in Vietnam (June 2005), to domestic cats and rare civets, which in 2003 spread the human outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), another virus that originates in poultry. \"Every species leap [by H5N1] represents a new virus mutation, increasing the chance that one will become highly infectious to humans,\" says Dr Peter Horby, an epidemiologist at the World Health Organisation (WHO), in Hanoi. In northern Vietnam, H5N1 first jumped to humans in January 2004. The virus triggered an explosive cytokine storm in the body as the immune system was induced to attack human tissue, causing massive haemorrhaging in the lungs. The x-rays of one patient in its grip are chilling: on day five, the bottom left of her lung is partially fogged; by day seven, both lungs have filled, as she drowned in her own body fluids. Within 18 months, 87 people in Vietnam had been infected; 38 of them died excruciating deaths. With each new case, the virus advanced, infecting larger clusters of patients, remaining for weeks in one community before re-emerging in another without visible links. In other Asian countries, including Thailand and Hong Kong, outbreaks among humans were quickly brought under control, but in Vietnam the virus lingered, its ever-changing symptoms making it harder to diagnose and treat. \"We are at a critical situation in Vietnam,\" Horby says. \"There are little alarm bells ringing everywhere in Vietnam. The pandemic is inevitable - and probably soon.\" However, rather then allow epidemiologists free access to its H5N1 hotspots, the government in Hanoi balked at sharing biological samples with foreign scientists and instead went on a propaganda offensive. This autumn, it announced an £18m poultry vaccination programme which it claimed would protect all birds from the virus. It said it had recruited 10,000 animal health workers to scour the countryside for diseased birds. The daily newspaper Labour told readers that no new cases of human infection had been registered. State radio announced that a new treatment regime, using oseltamivir, an anti-viral drug currently being stockpiled across Europe and the US, had enabled doctors to \"cure\" dozens of victims. According to one recent government statement, Vietnam had cut the bird flu death rate in humans from 70% in 2004 to 20% this year. Last month, government scientists revealed they were on the verge of going into clinical trials with a radical human vaccine. The country was working hard and winning the war without foreign intervention, Hanoi said. The threat of a pandemic had subsided. Our car lollops along beside the festival revellers and scores of chickens crammed into coops ready for market as Vietnamese consumers return to eating poultry after two years of fear. We have with us a farmer we picked up 60 miles back at Counter A145 of Hanoi's Hang Da market, where he had just sold a cage-full of live birds. He agreed to show us his farm and now motions for us to take a right turn. The taxi launches itself over the wall of a dyke and skims across the paddy. We abandon it in the mud and wade into a large pond of reddish water filled with geese and ducks. \"More than 600, I think,\" the farmer says, throwing fistfuls of seed into the air. He pulls a plump duck out of the water, inspecting it carefully and signalling that it is a perfect specimen, unaware that many of these birds are likely to be H5N1 carriers, shedding the virus into the water they paddle in and on the ground they defecate on, and potentially passing it on to the humans who share their environment. The highest risk of all is at the moment of slaughter, when fine particles of poultry blood, mucus and faeces are sprayed through the air. The farmer wades with his trophy over to a platform where a fire is fizzing. We realise he is going to slaughter the bird to mark our visit and wonder whether we should have brought protective gloves, hats and masks. The farmer folds back the duck's neck, slits its throat, and blood fountains into a bucket. \"Don't worry,\" he says. \"Vietnamese birds are now safe. It's the imported Chinese ones, pumped full of chemicals, that carry disease. Vietnam has won the war. Our doctors have beaten bird flu.\" Having seen off the French in 1954 at the siege of Dien Bien Phu and the Americans 21 years later with the fall of Saigon, Vietnam is prickly about foreign intervention. Before visiting, all foreign reporters have to propose an itinerary that is then hotly debated and policed by a ministry of foreign affairs minder. It is a costly endeavour: up to $300 a day for the minder, monetary gifts for provincial party apparatchiks and district People's Committee chairmen, small change given before entering anyone's house. We were granted a visa in 48 hours, and one day later were sitting in a minibus, heading out into the countryside around Hanoi. We had put together a list of potential bird flu hotspots to visit; almost all were rejected by the ministry as being \"too far\", \"speculative\" or \"unconfirmed cases\". However, the government agreed to accompany us to review a recent human cluster in Thai Binh province, a place that has endured more H5N1 outbreaks than any other. \"We want you to see we are battling and rapidly winning against bird flu,\" our minder said. We had left the capital at dawn, but it was mid-afternoon before we arrived at our destination, having collected on the way representatives from the People's Committee (External Affairs Division), the Preventive Medical Centre, the People's Committee (Foreign Affairs Division), the Department of Protocol (Press Division), the Department of Animal Health and the Ministry of Agriculture. In the remote village of Thuy Lung, the Nguyen family were waiting as the light began to fade. Their cinderblock house was ringed by piles of shaved bamboo that they painted and plaited into temple offerings, many thousands of which would make a couple of dollars. They mumbled begrudgingly for us to come inside, where a young man, watchstrap thin, was sitting, his chest concave, his double tracheotomy scar bobbling as he gasped for every breath. He introduced himself to us like a worn-down scientific specimen. \"Tuan. Aged 21. Confirmed H5N1 victim, February 27 2005. Quite well now, thank you.\" Three members of his family had come down with bird flu that February. Tuan said he had no idea how he got the virus. His father, Nham, interrupted: \"It was last lunar new year. We bought two chickens and a goose. Tuan and I slaughtered them there.\" He pointed to a concrete wall. \"We ate them for three days. He became ill and was sick for 10 days before I took him to hospital on the back of a motorbike on February 20. My son had a fever and was coughing.\" The local clinic moved Tuan to the district hospital which referred him to the provincial hospital which sent him to the Bach Mai tropical medicine hospital in Hanoi, where all bird flu cases from northern Vietnam are treated. Tuan remained there until May 13. Who else had become sick? \"My daughter became ill on February 21,\" Nham said of Ngoan, Tuan's 14-year-old sister. \"Maybe she got it from the birds, too.\" Our minder nodded in agreement. \"She was rushed to Hanoi, but had a mild infection and was discharged two weeks later. Both my children were cured.\" That left one more infection in the family. \"Tuan's grandfather was also infected,\" Nham said. \"He was not really ill, no fever, coughing or headaches. My son cannot go out to the rice fields yet.\" He'd left hospital weighing only five stone. \"But he can look after the TV and video machine here.\" Nham pointed to a dusty Chinese cabinet behind him, then to a photo of Tuan before he fell ill. The full-faced boy dressed in a dark suit and brogues, out with friends in Thai Binh, was barely recognisable. The minder turned to us: \"This is the story of how doctors cured one of the most severe cases of bird flu to hit Vietnam.\" However, there were crucial aspects of the story that the minder did his best to gloss over. Tuan was certainly infected after helping his father slaughter birds - but his sister only became sick 11 days later and had no contact with the live or slaughtered fowl, other than eating the cooked meat, from which you cannot contract H5N1. The virus can live in the environment for only 48 hours outside a host, so the sister must have been in close proximity to someone carrying the virus, such as her brother. Here was a likely case of human-to-human transmission, a critical pre-pandemic stage. Tuan's grandfather was found to be H5N1-positive 17 days after the infected birds had been slaughtered, and 15 days after Tuan had become sick. He had no contact with the slaughtered poultry, so was also likely to have contracted the virus from Tuan. No one volunteered any information about the fourth victim in the Thuy Lung cluster. Scientific reports we had seen mentioned that a nurse had fallen sick with suspected bird flu at Thai Thuy district hospital on February 27, seven days after Tuan was admitted. This case was presented as separate from the Nguyen cluster. We asked to visit the hospital. \"It's closed today,\" the minder snapped. Why would a hospital close on a Saturday? He scrambled for an answer. \"Maybe I can let you go on Monday.\" Two days later, we arrived at the hospital in a minibus full of officials, scattering a group of women in conical straw hats. Ushered into a vast committee room, we sat below a bust of Ho Chi Minh, long-deceased founder of the Vietnamese communist party, to hear Dr Dao Trong Bich, the hospital deputy director, repeating a familiar refrain: \"This was the most severe case of H5N1 in Vietnam. Our doctors struggled hard and cured him after 82 days in hospital.\" A pale young man entered the room and shook our hands. \"Nurse Thinh, 26, was sick but now 100% fit and can work every day,\" Bich said. How did Thinh think he had been infected? He shrugged: \"I live in the hospital dorm and couldn't have come into contact with poultry, only nurses and patients.\" With Tuan? \"Oh yes. On February 20, I looked after Tuan for seven hours until I was asked to separate him from other patients.\" Bich grimaced. Did Thinh follow any special procedures? He looked nervously at Bich. \"I followed procedure.\" What was it? \"To wear protective clothes.\" A long pause. \"A white hat ... and a mask ... maybe gloves?\" Bich chipped in: \"We are trying our best, but we do not have facilities to treat H5N1. We have a small supply of oseltamivir, 200 pills.\" Enough for a handful of patients. \"We are not frightened. We must follow the guidance given by the provincial centre.\" We approached the provincial authorities at Thai Binh's preventive medical centre. The director who had agreed to brief us was called away, leaving his deputy unprepared. A secretary hastily showed vice-director Dr Bui Thu Hien a pile of notes. He read: \"The first cases in Vietnam of humans infected with H5N1 were identified in this province on January 17 2004. After the epidemic started, it began scattering and we had several epicentres. Up until March this year, there have been four clusters in this province, involving 10 patients, half of whom died.\" The secretary whispered furiously in Hien's ear, as if to hush him up. But he continued: \"1) January 2004, here in Thai Binh city, one brother and two sisters died. The brother's wife was also infected but survived. A fifth member of the cluster was identified 10km away. 2) The following December in Kien Xuong district, three brothers were infected, with one showing no symptoms, another becoming sick and a third dying. 3) This February, a cluster in Thuy Lung village with a 21-year-old, his sister, their grandfather and a male nurse at the local clinic.\" This was the Nguyen family cluster and Hien had confirmed that all four infections were interlinked. He continued: \"The fourth cluster was in February this year in Kien Xuong district, where a 69-year-old and his wife contracted H5N1. He died and his wife survived. He kept chickens in his back yard, but none of them was sick and so none was culled.\" What had been concluded in each case? Were there any common denominators - a poultry breeder who supplied all the families? Hien leafed through the notes and stroked his chin. \"There are no definite conclusions. But we stay vigilant. This is a threat not only to our community but to the whole world.\" To his left, unmentioned, was a wall-mounted map of the province, dotted with the path of the virus: black triangles (outbreaks in birds); purple spots (human deaths, 2005); red triangles (human cases with symptoms); red spots (humans with no symptoms); red triangles with yellow spots (human deaths, 2004). Thai Binh was pockmarked with bird flu. There were doctors and bureaucrats who had grasped the scale of the crisis, but whose ability to respond was limited by resources, expertise and cultural attitudes. When bird flu first emerged, the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE) in Hanoi, the leading analytical centre, had no safety cabinets, freezers, centrifuges or incubators, and had to turn to the WHO for a £30,000 loan. \"We did not even have masks and gloves,\" said virologist Le Thi Quynh Mai. Even today, the Bach Mai tropical medicine hospital in Hanoi, where Tuan and dozens of other bird flu victims were treated, still does not have a proper isolation ward. As problematic was the adversity in Vietnam to postmortems - no autopsies were consented to by the families of the 38 bird flu victims. When signs emerged that a pandemic was imminent, every country was asked to report all bird flu cases to the WHO. But Vietnamese scientists were reluctant to pass on their data and the WHO rebuked Hanoi for dragging its feet. Researchers in Britain, China, Canada, Japan, Italy and the US complained that hundreds of throat swabs and serum samples from bird flu victims and their relatives were locked away at the NIHE. Guan Yi, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, who had been tracking the evolution of H5N1 after it briefly emerged there in 1997, told us, \"We need samples almost in real time and that is not happening.\" The limited data that virologists in Britain, the US and Hong Kong were able to extract from Vietnam further contradicted the claim by Hanoi that it had the virus under control. The much-touted fall in deaths from bird flu in Vietnam, coupled with an increase in mild H5N1 infections and asymptomatic cases, was a sign that bird flu had further mutated and was now entering an increasingly deadly stage. John Oxford, at the London School of Medicine, explains, \"Any virus needs live hosts if it is to be successfully promulgated around the world. To kill soon after infection would bring a rapid end to an epidemic. When H5N1 begins to kill fewer and infect more, as it is now, a pandemic is potentially close by.\" We left Thai Binh preventive medical centre and asked to visit the other clusters revealed by Hien. But in every case the minder found a reason why we couldn't go. \"In the first cluster, the wife ran away; we don't know where she is.\" And the parents of the three dead children? \"They have gone to live somewhere else.\" And so on. We sat in silence as the minibus crawled back to Hanoi. A day or two later we persuaded the reluctant minder to help us track down that first family. In a nest of alleyways behind a chicken noodle shop in Thai Binh city, a friend of the bereaved family, a member of the local People's Committee, led us to the small door of their neighbour's house. We were beckoned inside. An elderly woman poured green tea and explained how the mother had been driven mad by grief. \"This was the first terrible bird flu cluster in the province but the authorities panicked and did not know what to do. My neighbour lost her son and her two daughters in no time at all. And last week her mother died, too. Wait, please, and I'll see if anyone can bear to see you.\" The old woman reappeared with sticks of incense. \"You can honour their loss,\" she said, pointing to a door on the opposite side of the alley. We knocked and Le Thi Sang let us in. Her neighbour motioned for us to sit on small stools. Sang said she would never get over the loss of her three children; her son went first, then days after he was buried, her two daughters, who had looked after him in hospital, became feverish. \"They found it impossible to breathe,\" Sang said. \"Then they were gone.\" We saw three bicycles still parked in the back yard. Did anyone come to investigate the deaths? \"They came. Told me nothing and asked me nothing. Said they were sorry and that they would keep people from bothering me.\" She pointed up to the corner of the darkened room, to where she had built a shrine with three school photographs draped in black velvet ribbons. Beneath were their dates: Hong, 1974 to January 2004; Hung, 1973 to January 2004; Hanh, 1981 to January 2004. Our incense sticks crackled and glowed as they were lit and added to the offerings - pomelos, pomegranates, a bottle of Vietnamese champagne - peppery smoke coiling around the story of her loss. The WHO began to suspect it was not getting the whole story from Hanoi last spring and took emergency measures, mounting an inspection tour of the clusters of bird flu cases from northern Vietnam. What the team found was alarming: new bird flu strains had emerged. In several cases, people were carriers without becoming sick. In others, patients were infected but developed symptoms never before associated with the virus - such as diarrhoea and vomiting - leading to misdiagnosis and resulting in an unknown number of victims being sent back out into the community while still highly infectious. In May, an emergency meeting was convened at the WHO's regional office in Manila, in the Philippines. It concluded: \"The pattern of disease appears to have changed [in north Vietnam] in a manner consistent with the possibility that human-to-human transmission has occurred.\" If action is delayed until there is unmistakable evidence, it most likely will be too late to prevent large numbers of infections and deaths. By September the WHO was troubled by news that the country's poultry vaccination programme had failed. Last year Vietnam slaughtered more than 55 million birds after H5N1 first emerged, at a loss of $190m or 0.5% of the country's gross domestic product. But since there were still 220 million more fowl in the country, in September Hanoi invested heavily in the inoculations. Dr Hoang Van Nam, deputy director of the department of animal health, told us his officers had begun with two pilot projects that had both now failed. \"The trial programmes were supposed to have been completed before the lunar new year when people buy more chickens and ducks than at any other time. But we have a long way to go.\" In one pilot area, poultry in only 38 out of 127 communes had been vaccinated. In the second, 1 million fowl were still to be injected. Nam said in both pilots his officers found it hard to distinguish between birds that had been vaccinated and those that had slipped through the programme, making it impossible to work out which were to receive a booster 28 days later, without which the vaccination would fail. No one was supposed to eat or sell birds that had been vaccinated for 30 days after the first injection, but without records or tagging, this rule was unenforceable. In September, the WHO circulated a report to governments around the world: \"Events unfolding in parts of Asia... have sounded a general warning that a pandemic might be imminent. All countries should undertake urgent action to prepare ... to reduce morbidity, mortality and social disruption.\" What does a government do when faced with such an immeasurable threat? In the past few weeks, countries have been advised by the WHO to expand morgue space and intensive care facilities, to be ready to close schools and prepare strict quarantine measures. Mass events such as football matches would have to be suspended in the event of a pandemic. In Britain, GPs received 50-page pamphlets from Sir Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer, with advice on how to spot the symptoms of bird flu that department of health models demonstrated could easily kill up to 650,000 people in the UK alone. Professor Michael Osterholm, a director at the US department of homeland security, told us, \"What people have to understand is that H5N1 will change the world overnight. Foreign trade and travel would be reduced or ended. Transportation would be curtailed. Global, regional and national economies would come to an abrupt halt. I have been accused of being too shrill, scaring people out of their wits, but what I am trying to do is scare them into their wits.\" Many governments have begun work on emergency pandemic plans, and one of the key issues they are dealing with is the availability of antivirals. Oseltamivir is in incredibly short supply, with sufficient doses for only 40 million people worldwide - one quarter of the British population being covered, but less than 1% of that in the US. In any case, oseltamivir is highly problematic. The drug sold under the name Tamiflu has proved hard to administer, requiring large doses, and is ineffective unless prescribed soon after infection takes hold. One recent simulation of the pandemic conducted by Imperial College, London, showed the antiviral would have to reach 80% of the affected population \"within three weeks\" of an outbreak - something of an impossibility given the drug's short supply and the speed at which the virus will move. In Asia, the virus has even begun to circumvent oseltamivir: a patient from north Vietnam is resistant to the drug and Tokyo University has reported that 18% of those treated with it became resistant. The good news is that humans still remain poor conductors for bird flu. The virus concentrates in the lower respiratory system, making it harder to transmit than ordinary human flu, which invades the upper respiratory tract and is easily transmitted through coughing, sneezing or breathing. The bad news is that in two months' time, the temperature in Vietnam will begin to drop and colds and flus of the common or garden variety will set in. It is also the time of Tet Nguyen Dan, the lunar new year, when most families come together, travelling the length and breadth of the country, buying a live bird to slaughter at home for a celebratory dinner. All it will take is for one person unknowingly infected with H5N1 by a diseased butchered bird to sit on a bench beside someone with a bad case of the human cold and what could emerge is a recombined bird flu virus with the ability to spread around the world at the speed of a sneeze.",
        "debiased_text": "The article describes observations made during a trip through villages in the northern province of Thai Binh, Vietnam, during the mid-autumn festival known as Tet Trung Thu. Poultry farming and slaughtering are common in the area, with ducks and chickens raised in close proximity to humans. Concerns are raised about avian influenza (H5N1), which has been detected in a significant proportion of poultry in the region. Since its first detection in Vietnam in December 2003, H5N1 has spread to multiple countries across Asia and into Europe. The virus has shown the ability to infect various species, including humans, pigs, cats, and wild birds. In humans, H5N1 has caused severe respiratory illness and fatalities. Vietnam has reported efforts to combat the virus through vaccination programs and public health measures, though challenges remain in implementation and international cooperation. Scientific experts warn of the potential for the virus to mutate and become more easily transmissible between humans, which could lead to a pandemic. The article notes that while the Vietnamese government has claimed progress in controlling the virus, international health organizations express concerns about the accuracy of reporting and the effectiveness of containment measures. The article also discusses global preparedness efforts, including stockpiling antiviral medications like oseltamivir, though supplies are limited and resistance to the drug has been observed in some cases."

        "original_text": "The US increased pressure on China to free an American-based academic who has been jailed on spying charges, with 40 senators, including John Kerry and Hillary Clinton, writing to President Hu Jintao yesterday demanding his immediate release. Yang Jianli, a veteran of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, was arrested in 2002 after entering China on a friend's passport and travelling for a week on a fake identity card to observe labour unrest in the north-east. He was sentenced to five years' jail in May last year. \"We strongly urge your government to use its discretion, in accordance with Chinese law, to release Dr Yang,\" the senators said in a letter emailed to Reuters by the group Freedom Now, which has represented Dr Yang's family since his detention. \"We believe a decision to release Dr Yang would be welcomed by all those who seek to improve the bilateral relationship between the United States and China.\" The signatories also included Elizabeth Dole and Edward Kennedy. Dr Yang's wife, Christina Fu, said his health was poor and that she was hopeful the political pressure would pay off. \"I feel very encouraged by this very strong support,\" she said from Boston. \"I am optimistic, very hopeful that my husband will be granted medical parole.\" Jared Genser, of Freedom Now, said he hoped Dr Yang would be freed before Mr Hu visits the United States in September. Liu Jianchao, a foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing, said China attached importance to the letter, but disputed Ms Fu's claim that her husband's health was poor and said his term was not up for another two years. \"We have also communicated with the US side, including US senators, on relevant questions,\" he told a news conference. \"Such communications are frequent and are conducive to enhancing the understanding between the two sides. However, the Chinese side will still handle relevant questions according to law.\" The letter expressed concern over Dr Yang's health, saying he was allegedly beaten and tortured by prison guards, but his requests to see his lawyer to file charges had been denied. The detention and poor treatment of Dr Yang, 41, contradicted China's claim, in a report on its own human rights, that they had brought violations by government officials under control, the letter said. China said yesterday that a prominent sociologist and an official from the country's leading government thinktank had been detained earlier this year on suspicion of leaking state secrets. Unidentified sources had first reported the detentions of Lu Jianhua, a sociologist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (Cass), and Chen Hui, an assistant to the director of the Cass general office, earlier this month. They are the latest in a series of intellectuals, reporters and dissidents held behind bars in China. Mr Lu had ties to Ching Cheong, a Hong Kong-based reporter for Singapore's Straits Times newspaper, who was detained on April 22.",
        "debiased_text": "The US government has called for the release of an American-based academic detained in China on espionage charges.

Other signatories included Elizabeth Dole and Edward Kennedy. Yang's wife, Christina Fu, reported concerns about his health and expressed hope for medical parole. Freedom Now, representing Yang's family, suggested his potential release ahead of President Hu's September visit to the US. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao acknowledged the letter while maintaining that Yang's sentence has two years remaining and that his health condition differs from Fu's claims. Liu noted ongoing communications between Chinese and US officials on such matters. The senators' letter raised allegations of mistreatment during Yang's detention, citing denied legal access, which they stated contrasts with China's human rights record. Separately, Chinese authorities confirmed the detention of sociologist Lu Jianhua and government thinktank official Chen Hui earlier this year on state secrets allegations. These cases follow other detentions of intellectuals and journalists in China, including Hong Kong-based reporter Ching Cheong in April."

        "title": "China Lends Russia $6 Billion To Help Finance Yukos Deal; Move Secures Oil Supplies For Beijing and Heightens Doubts Over Kremlin Plans; China Lends Russia $6 Billion To Help Finance Yukos Deal; Move Secures Oil Supplies For Beijing and Heightens Doubts Over Kremlin Plans",
        "original_text": "MOSCOW -- China lent Russia $6 billion to help finance nationalization of the main unit of OAO Yukos, underscoring energy- thirsty Beijing's desire to line up fuel supplies from Russia. The deal, secured by future oil shipments and announced by Russian officials, also fueled rising uncertainty about the Kremlin's ultimate plan for the unit, a Siberian company called Yuganskneftegaz that by itself produces about 1% of world crude output, or about as much as Indonesia. State oil company OAO Rosneft, which took over Yugansk in December, had been discussing the sale of a 15% stake in Yugansk with state oil companies from China and India, but a person close to the situation said those talks are on hold now that the loan from China has taken the financial pressure off Rosneft. If it stops there, a loan agreement would fall short of China's overall goal of gaining outright ownership stakes among the world's big oil reserves to feed its surging economy. But a loan agreement is easier to reach because of legal and management control issues and nervousness within Russia over selling parts of its oil industry to other nations. Russian officials provided few details of the financing arrangement with the Chinese. But the loan in effect is a forward payment for a total of 48 million metric tons of crude oil -- or about 352 million barrels -- Rosneft already has agreed to ship to China by rail through 2010. The contract, a replacement for a similar agreement with Yukos, meets a small portion of China's demand, which is estimated by the International Energy Agency to reach 6.2 million barrels a day this year. The state takeover of Yugansk marked the culmination of a Kremlin campaign to dismantle the empire of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the politically ambitious Yukos founder, and reassert control over the strategic oil sector lost in the controversial privatizations of the 1990s. The Kremlin drive has raised questions about President Vladimir Putin's commitment to a market economy, the rule of law and Russia's long-term reliability as a global energy supplier. It also has sparked legal challenges in Russia, Europe and the U.S. from Yukos, which owned Yugansk until it was sold for $9.4 billion in a controversial December auction to pay off tax claims totaling $28 billion. While Western energy companies have a deep interest in tapping Russia's vast oil reserves, the threat of legal action has discouraged them from seeking a deal for Yugansk. Also yesterday, doubts grew about plans announced in September to merge Rosneft into state-controlled natural gas giant OAO Gazprom, creating a Kremlin-run titan with some of the largest oil and gas reserves in the world. Sergei Oganesyan, Moscow's No. 2 oil official, said his view is that Rosneft should stay independent and retain control over Yugansk. That contradicted earlier statements by officials that Yugansk would be spun off into a separate company, while the rest of Rosneft merged into Gazprom. That transaction was to open the way to a long-awaited lifting of restrictions on foreign ownership of the roughly 49% of Gazprom stock that isn't owned by Russian authorities. Yesterday, a Gazprom spokesman said the merger with Rosneft, which already has been delayed several times, remains on track. Rosneft declined to comment. Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said Chinese state banks had loaned Russian state bank Vneshekonombank $6 billion to finance the deal, although it wasn't clear whether he was referring to Rosneft's initial acquisition or a subsequent refinancing. A Vneshekonombank spokeswoman couldn't be reached for comment. Chinese officials in Moscow and Beijing also were unavailable. Officials and analysts said the financial maneuvering isn't likely to significantly affect oil output at Yugansk, which produces about one million barrels a day of crude. Rosneft has vowed to invest heavily in the unit, which suffered a cash shortage along with the rest of Yukos in the second half of last year. Yukos Chief Executive Steven Theede said Yugansk had missed a critical window for preparing oil-field work at the end of last year as a result of the financial crisis caused by the back-tax claims and court-ordered freezes on Yukos's bank accounts. Though the unit's monthly production was down 6% in December from its 2004 peak, \"if investment is put into Yuganskneftegaz immediately, there may be a chance to arrest the decline,\" Mr. Theede said. Yesterday, Mr. Oganesyan, the oil official, said overall Russian production will rise about 6% this year to at least 9.74 million barrels a day from 9.19 million barrels in 2004. After several years of strong gains, Russian output growth long has been expected to slow and analysts said Rosneft's takeover of Yugansk isn't likely to have any dramatic immediate effect. Yukos officials, meanwhile, vowed to press their legal challenges to the Yugansk sale, which have brought them an order from a U.S. bankruptcy court in Houston that sought to block the auction. \"As of right now, Yuganskneftegaz is stolen property,\" Mr. Theede said from London. Mr. Theede, who left Russia in the fall, says he won't come back because he fears official \"harassment.\" Other Yukos executives have been questioned and some jailed in relation to the back-tax and other cases against the company.",
        "debiased_text": "MOSCOW -- China provided Russia with a $6 billion loan to assist in financing the nationalization of the main unit of OAO Yukos. The agreement, secured by future oil shipments, was confirmed by Russian officials. The unit in question, Yuganskneftegaz, is a Siberian company responsible for approximately 1% of global crude oil production, comparable to Indonesia's output. State oil company OAO Rosneft, which acquired Yugansk in December, had previously been in discussions to sell a 15% stake in Yugansk to state oil companies from China and India. However, a source familiar with the matter indicated those talks are currently on hold following the Chinese loan, which alleviated financial pressure on Rosneft. The loan arrangement represents a partial step toward China's broader objective of securing ownership interests in major global oil reserves to support its growing economy. Legal and management considerations, as well as domestic concerns in Russia about foreign ownership of its oil industry, make loan agreements more feasible than direct stake acquisitions. Few details were disclosed regarding the financing arrangement between Russia and China. The loan effectively serves as an advance payment for 48 million metric tons of crude oil (approximately 352 million barrels) that Rosneft has agreed to deliver to China by rail through 2010. This contract replaces a prior agreement with Yukos and addresses a fraction of China's oil demand, projected by the International Energy Agency to reach 6.2 million barrels per day this year. The nationalization of Yugansk followed a series of actions by Russian authorities to consolidate control over the oil sector, which had been privatized in the 1990s. The process has raised debates about market economy principles, legal frameworks, and Russia's role as a global energy supplier. It has also prompted legal challenges from Yukos in multiple jurisdictions. Western energy companies, while interested in Russia's oil reserves, have been cautious due to legal uncertainties surrounding Yugansk. Separately, plans announced in September to merge Rosneft with state-controlled OAO Gazprom have faced doubts. Sergei Oganesyan, a senior Russian oil official, stated that Rosneft should remain independent and retain control over Yugansk, diverging from earlier proposals to spin off Yugansk into a separate entity during the merger. Gazprom officials maintain that the merger with Rosneft is still proceeding, despite prior delays. Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin confirmed that Chinese state banks loaned $6 billion to Russian state bank Vneshekonombank for the deal, though it remains unclear whether this refers to Rosneft's initial acquisition or subsequent refinancing. Representatives from Vneshekonombank and Chinese officials were unavailable for comment. Analysts suggest the financial transactions are unlikely to significantly impact Yugansk's daily production of approximately one million barrels of crude. Rosneft has stated its intention to increase investment in Yugansk, which experienced financial challenges last year. Yukos CEO Steven Theede noted that Yugansk missed key operational preparations due to financial disruptions but indicated that timely investment could stabilize production. Russian oil output is expected to rise by about 6% this year to at least 9.74 million barrels per day. Legal disputes over the Yugansk sale continue, with Yukos executives pursuing challenges in multiple jurisdictions, including a U.S. bankruptcy court ruling that sought to halt the auction. Some Yukos executives have faced legal scrutiny in relation to tax and other cases involving the company."

        "title": "MUSIC; Going with the worldwide flow; Philip Glass bridged geography and cultures to create 'Orion,' which receives its West Coast premiere tonight.: [HOME EDITION]",
        "original_text": "A row of three stars forming a belt makes Orion one of the easiest constellations to spot. Named after a hunter in Greek mythology, it's one of the few star patterns that can be seen -- at least in part -- from both the Northern and Southern hemispheres.\nThe universality of this astral formation provided a cue for Philip Glass when the committee overseeing the 2004 Athens Cultural Olympiad asked him to compose a new work for last year's Games.\nIn their spirit, he envisioned fellow composers and performers from around the world coming together to play in their own styles and also to create a coherent whole.\nGlass wound up working with instrumentalists from seven cultures - - including master sitar player Ravi Shankar, who first introduced him to non-Western music in 1965 when the two collaborated in India. That encounter proved to be pivotal in his development, paving the way for his use of repetitive rhythmic patterns in the style that was dubbed Minimalism.\nUltimately, he named the new piece \"Orion,\" and it premiered last year at the Odeion of Herodes Atticus at the base of the Acropolis. Tonight, the 90-minute work will receive its West Coast premiere at the Orange County Performing Arts Center on the closing program of this year's Eclectic Orange Festival.\n\"Every culture has created myths and taken inspiration from Orion,\" Glass, 68, said by phone recently during a rehearsal break in New York City. \"One of my favorites is the myth of the hunter who was blind on Earth, but when he was put in the heavens, he could see.\n\"That's a great parable of the artist -- the poet who sees at night but is blind during the day. He's a visionary when he sees, and when that capability is not functioning, he's an ordinary person.\"\nIn a succession of solos and overlapping entrances and exits, \"Orion\" showcases musicians and instruments from Australia (Mark Atkins, didgeridoo), China (Wu Man, pipa), Canada (Ashley MacIsaac, fiddle), Africa (Foday Musa Suso, kora and nyanyer), Brazil (Uatki, Brazilian percussion), India (Kartik Seshadri, sitar) and Greece (Eleftheria Arvanitaki, vocalist).\nAll the soloists return for the finale, a traditional Greek song sung by Arvanitaki.\nHolding everything together is the Philip Glass Ensemble -- three woodwinds, three synthesizers, voice and two percussionists -- which backs the soloists.\nWorking with artists from different musical traditions, however, tested even Glass' flexibility. Suso, for instance, mailed him a tape of a solo he wanted to play on his stringed instruments, and the composer worked around it, writing an accompaniment that \"would ease in and out of the piece and which would support and anticipate Foday's melodies, echo them and play countermelodies.\"\nBut when the two got together to rehearse, \"Foday was playing something entirely different. I said, 'That's not the piece you wrote.' He said, 'I'm playing something else.' He basically composed a new piece to go with the piece I wrote with his first piece in mind.\"\nSo what did Glass do?\n\"I went with the flow.\"\nWith didgeridoo player Atkins, Glass wrote essentially a music- minus-one piece to leave the musician \"space to compose\" on his 5- foot Aboriginal wind instrument. For Wu Man and her Chinese lute, he wrote a cadenza, then built a piece based on that. \"She took my melodies and rhythms but played them in the style of Chinese music,\" he said.\nShankar wrote the piece representing India. At 85, however, he was reluctant to travel to Athens for the premiere and sent a student in his place. Nevertheless, he remained active in \"Orion's\" progress.\n\"He kept changing things,\" said Glass. \"Ravi composed a number of melodies based on a rhythm of nine -- all the different ways to count to nine you can imagine. Then he recomposed the material. We went back and forth. Then, at the end, he wanted another change. I kept moving things around to fit.\n\"That was the most difficult piece to play. Every day we began with it. We got to the 10th day and then we could play it.\"\nAlthough it took place over long distances, the entire collaboration, Glass said, took only a year.\n\"We scheduled a two-week rehearsal period together in New York, but we couldn't get visas for everybody because of the Homeland Security Act. We didn't actually rehearse until Athens, where we worked every day. Then it rained the day of the premiere. But we had fun with the rain.\"\nThe work was later repeated in Italy, France and London.\n\"Because it needs so many virtuosos, I didn't think we'd ever manage to do it again,\" he said. \"To get this kind of touring going is amazing.\"\nNot everyone has been enchanted with the results.\n\" 'Orion' is fuzzy, feelgood entertainment designed to support the fuzzy, feelgood thesis that there isn't much wrong with the Brotherhood of Man that a ... good long-jump competition can't put right,\" said the London Times.\nGlass, though, isn't fazed by such criticism. \"I've been in that dialogue my whole life -- whether it was really a legitimate thing to know other traditions,\" he said. \"The main thing was to look at each of the traditions and find the commonality they had. Where does it make sense to be together and in a way that honors the uniqueness of the traditions we're working with?\n\"What I'm particularly pleased with is the way the idea worked with the musicians. Orion is a constellation you can see all over the world. Every culture has a different story about it. But looking at stars is the beginning of culture, of arts, of sciences.

        "debiased_text": "The constellation Orion, identifiable by a row of three stars forming a belt, is visible in parts of both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Its universal recognition inspired composer Philip Glass when he was commissioned to create a new work for the 2004 Athens Cultural Olympiad.\n\nGlass collaborated with instrumentalists from seven cultures, including sitar player Ravi Shankar, with whom he first worked in 1965.

The Philip Glass Ensemble provides accompaniment with three woodwinds, three synthesizers, voice, and two percussionists.\n\nThe collaboration presented logistical and creative challenges. Suso altered his performance from the initially submitted material, requiring Glass to adapt. Similar adjustments were made for other soloists to accommodate their styles. Shankar, who composed the Indian section, revised his work multiple times before the premiere.\n\nRehearsals were delayed due to visa issues under the Homeland Security Act, leading to condensed preparations in Athens. The performance proceeded despite rain on the premiere day. The work has since been performed in Italy, France, and London.\n\nCritical reception has varied. The London Times described \"Orion\" as \"fuzzy, feelgood entertainment\" promoting global unity. Glass stated the project aimed to explore commonalities across musical traditions while honoring their uniqueness, using Orion as a unifying symbol recognized worldwide with varying cultural interpretations."

E-mail: Josue@asu.edu.\nA decade after the North American Free Trade Agreement, better known as NAFTA, was signed by the United States, Canada and Mexico, it seems fair to ask: Who's winning as a result of it?\nHere's the situation as I see it.\nThe big winner is Wal-Mart. That company is opening stores throughout Mexico much as it has done in the United States.\nWal-Mart, as you may know, pays the lowest wages possible and hates the idea of having unionized workers. That is as true in Mexico as it is in the United States. The big secret discovered by Wal-Mart is to import cheap merchandise from China to use as come- ons at the end of the aisles. Then sell that merchandise to unwary U.S. and Mexican customers who buy up the stuff without asking how it got there.\nWho loses?\nWhy Mexico, of course, along with displaced U.S. workers who used to make the merchandise that is now coming from China. Much of the merchandise was formerly manufactured here and in Mexico.\nNo longer. Small manufacturers in both countries are suffering from this arrangement. They can't even compete in their own countries. Many have folded, thereby increasing immigration into this country and increasing the enmity of U.S. folks toward displaced Mexican workers trying to cross our border.\nWhat does the United States sell to China post-NAFTA?\nAccording to President Bill Clinton's propaganda campaign for the trade agreement with China, the United States would sell tons of things to China, thereby helping U.S. businesses and workers.\nWhat actually happened?\nWell, both the United States and Mexico got skewered. According to a recent TV documentary on Wal-Mart, what we are selling to China is old newspapers and scrap metal. The metal is used there to manufacture the items that are then sold in box stores both here and in Mexico, and the boxes used to ship them.\nWho benefits from that arrangement?\nObviously Wal-Mart, along with U.S. scrap iron and scrap paper merchants, I suppose. If your job is to sell scrap metal, you should be doing fine.\n* The next time you hear unhappy workers in your state complaining that Mexicans have taken their jobs away, urge them to take another look. The trade policies of our own government, supported by Democrats and Republicans alike, have done more to create this situation than any foreign worker ever has.\nIf you don't agree with my portrayal, ask around your communities and see what is being exported to China from your hometown.\nNot much, I bet.",

This change has affected small manufacturers in both countries, with some businesses closing operations.\n\nPost-NAFTA trade data shows the U.S. exports materials including recycled newspapers and scrap metal to China. These materials are used in manufacturing products subsequently sold in various retail outlets, including those operating in the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nThe trade relationship primarily benefits large retailers like Wal-Mart and businesses involved in scrap material trading.

        "title": "Bush urges Opec to increase supply",
        "original_text": "George Bush today urged Opec to boost supply to keep petrol prices down as the US struggles with the after-effects of Hurricane Katrina. But the US president's appeals to the oil cartel were falling on deaf ears as Opec ministers, meeting in Vienna, expressed reluctance to take immediate action to increase oil production. Although there was talk of releasing an extra 2m barrels, the Opec president, the Kuwati oil minister Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah, made it clear the additional amount would be made available only when required. Oil prices have eased from a record $70.85 (£39) a barrel in the three weeks since Katrina. However, US light crude today rebounded $1.70 to $64.70 as another tropical storm threatened US Gulf energy facilities. Mr Bush said fuel disruptions triggered by Katrina had been addressed, \"but part of the cost of gasoline is the result of high crude oil prices, and one way to affect those prices is to conserve and the other way is to encourage increased supply\". The chancellor, Gordon Brown, representing the EU, last week called on Opec to release an extra 500,000 barrels a day. But most ministers in Opec - the source of more than one third of the world's oil - appear to favour no change in the current output. Several ministers said they were opposed to higher output quotas when global refining capacity was at full stretch and unable to process more crude. \"If nobody wants to buy it, why should we increase the output ceiling?\" said the Libyan energy minister, Fathi Omar Bin Shatwan. \"The problem is a shortage of refining capacity.\" OPEC production, including 2m barrels a day from Iraq, is already at a 25-year high of more than 30m barrels a day with ample inventories of crude. Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer and therefore the one with most clout, said it supported a ceiling hike but added that it did not see demand for more crude. Previous Opec increases have done little to ease fears over supply, and any increase is widely seen as meaningless because it merely ratifies existing production. In addition to concern about production stoppages after Katrina, prices were also driven higher by worries about instability in Iraq and the coming winter. However, Opec fears sharp price declines because high prices seem to have taken a toll on demand. Oil prices have risen more than 50% this year, driven by strong demand from the US and China. At current levels, prices have gone well past pec's official price band of $22-$28.",
        "debiased_text": "George Bush called on OPEC to increase oil supply to help mitigate rising fuel prices in the U.S. following Hurricane Katrina. However, OPEC ministers meeting in Vienna showed little immediate willingness to raise production. While discussions included a potential release of an additional 2 million barrels, OPEC President Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah of Kuwait stated the extra supply would only be authorized if necessary. Oil prices, which peaked at $70.85 per barrel after Katrina, have declined but rose by $1.70 to $64.70 due to concerns about another tropical storm affecting Gulf energy infrastructure. Bush noted that while fuel shortages post-Katrina had been resolved, elevated crude oil prices continue to impact gasoline costs. He suggested conservation and increased supply as possible solutions. Separately, Gordon Brown, representing the EU, had earlier requested OPEC to boost daily production by 500,000 barrels. However, most OPEC ministers, responsible for over a third of global oil output, indicated no immediate changes to production levels. Some ministers, including Libya’s Energy Minister Fathi Omar Bin Shatwan, argued against raising output quotas, citing limited global refining capacity. OPEC’s current production, including Iraq’s 2 million barrels per day, stands at over 30 million barrels daily—a 25-year high—with sufficient crude inventories. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, expressed openness to increasing the output ceiling but noted no current demand for additional crude. Past OPEC production hikes have had minimal impact on supply concerns, as they often formalize existing output levels. Supply concerns persist due to post-Katrina disruptions, instability in Iraq, and seasonal winter demand. Meanwhile, OPEC remains cautious about potential price declines, as high oil costs may be dampening demand. Prices have risen over 50% this year, driven by U.S. and Chinese consumption, and currently exceed OPEC’s target range of $22-$28 per barrel."

        "original_text": "BRUSSELS -- President Bush warned European nations that their plan to end a 15-year-old ban on arms sales to China \"could change the balance of relations between China and Taiwan\" and suggested it might prompt Congress to consider restrictions on trade with Europe. Mr. Bush said that although he has been assured \"to a man\" by the Europeans that lifting the arms embargo won't upset the strategic balance in Asia, Congress likely will need further persuading. French President Jacques Chirac told reporters yesterday that the \"arms embargo is no longer justified and has to be lifted.\" Mr. Chirac said the move \"wouldn't modify the strategic equilibrium\" of Asia. A spokeswoman for the European Union's foreign-policy chief, Javier Solana, said Mr. Bush's comments confirmed that their battle on China would be with the U.S. Congress, not the Bush administration. \"The administration knows that they cannot stop it -- we've said we are going to lift the embargo,\" said the spokeswoman, Cristina Gallach. Separately, on the second day of his European fence-mending tour, Mr. Bush got a pledge from all of the other 25 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to provide assistance to Iraqis. The last country to offer assistance, administration officials said, was France, an unswerving war opponent, which agreed to contribute a single military officer to assist in the NATO effort. The modest contributions didn't seem to faze Mr. Bush, who pronounced himself grateful for the assistance. \"Every contribution matters,\" Mr. Bush said. \"Twenty-six nations sitting around that table said it's important for NATO to be involved in Iraq. That's a strong statement.\" The EU imposed an embargo in 1989 after China's violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests, and EU leaders say they are almost certain to lift it later this year. Mr. Bush said European countries \"need to make sure that if they do so, that they sell it to the U.S. Congress. . . . Congress will be making the decisions . . . as to how to react to what will be perceived by some, perhaps, as a technology transfer to China.\" The EU plans to send technical experts to Congress to explain why it believes the organization's new code of conduct would be at least as restrictive on arms sales to China as the embargo. Earlier this month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a nonbinding resolution, by a vote of 411-3, that criticized an increase in arms sales by European nations to China and said lifting the embargo would \"place European security policy in direct conflict with United States security interests.\" The EU embargo is interpreted by governments in different ways. European arms sales to China have been rising sharply in recent years. The total value of licenses granted by EU government for military exports to China rose to 428 million euros ($559 million) in 2003 from about 62 million euros in 2001. European governments say these are low-tech goods that wouldn't alter the military balance between China and Taiwan, although they make public few details on the nature of the goods sold. France has led the drive to lift the EU arms embargo on China, and it is backed by U.S. allies such as Britain. United Kingdom officials believe the embargo is getting in the way of an increasingly important export market. In Washington, John Howard, vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said, \"I would want to see exactly what the EU does before we comment on any possible reaction.\" He declined to comment on whether member companies might be concerned about sanctions, but added, \"Sanctions have to be multilateral in order to work properly. . . . If the goal is to isolate a country with sanctions, one had better make sure they're adhered to by all.\" Defense companies who are among America's close European allies, including BAE Systems PLC in the U.K. could lose most from U.S. legislation to clamp down on technology transfers. A spokesman for BAE Systems said the company was \"concerned\" about the effect that lifting the China embargo could have in the U.S. Already, Congress has blocked an administration proposal to waive licensing requirements for exports to Britain, in part due to concerns that Britain might allow the know- how to be sold on to countries the U.S. wouldn't sell to itself. --- Philip Shishkin contributed to this article. ---",

A U.S. Chamber of Commerce official stated that the organization would wait to assess the EU's actions before commenting on potential repercussions. Defense firms in allied European countries, including BAE Systems in the U.K., could face significant impacts from U.S. measures restricting technology transfers. A BAE Systems spokesman expressed concern over potential U.S. reactions to the lifting of the embargo.

The deal, initiated by the US, was the result of year-long negotiations and will \"build on existing bilateral agreements of technology sharing to control emissions, but will not set mandatory targets\", explained the New York Times. Where the Wall Street Journal saw in the pact \"another nail in the coffin\" of Kyoto, the South China Morning Post hoped that it would \"complement rather than bypass the Kyoto protocol\". The treaty \"does have the potential to make a difference\", it believed, because \"it includes China and India - developing countries not bound by the Kyoto targets\". The Independent contrasted the \"belt-tightening\" of Kyoto and the \"technological fixes\" of the new pact. \"If new technology can do the job instead, without forcing people to drive their cars less ... hey presto, the problem is solved,\" it mused. But it wasn't holding its breath. The new agreement was \"long on vision but short on detail ... The amount of CO2 reduction [the treaty] provides for any given country will be simply what that country's politicians feel comfortable with - not what climate stability demands.\" Maybe so, but it was still a \"sign of limited progress\", said the Times. It showed that the US and Australia, neither of whom ratified the Kyoto protocol, had \"accepted the reality of global warming as a concern\". And it created \"another useful link with China and India, which have ratified Kyoto, but whose energy needs pose challenges for the future which go far beyond the current scope of the protocol\". The Australian welcomed the new pact. \"The political reality of Kyoto is that it was a power grab by the nations of old Europe - unrepentant polluters all - against the high-growth economies of the Asia-Pacific,\" it argued. \"Kyoto ... would punish Australia as the world's highest per capita greenhouse source - an accident of our low population and huge resource sector - despite the fact we create only 1.4% of global emissions.\"",

        "original_text": "Two days of intense talks between Beijing and Brussels concluded yesterday with no end in sight to the trade dispute preventing cheap Chinese clothes from entering the European Union. China stepped up its pressure on the EU last night, expressing its concern that the talks had failed to find a way of increasing the quotas placed on its textile exports in June. On one of the busiest shopping weekends of the year, retailers in Britain were also pressing for an early resolution to the dispute, which has left shiploads of low-cost Chinese knitwear, trousers, bras and blouses languishing at customs posts across the EU. Reports from Chinese state-run newspapers suggested that China had rejected the EU's proposal to borrow some quota capacity from 2006 and 2007 to ease the log jam. Encouraged by the opposition to the EU's quotas in northern European countries, the Chinese are holding out for an increase in the quotas. Cao Xinyu, a spokesman for the China National &amp; Textile Apparel Council, said transferring the quotas from other years was not a feasible solution. \"We hope they can raise the quota,\" he said. \"The main question is how much the increase in the quota would be if both sides agree to increase it.\" The six-strong EU team, led by Fritz-Harald Wenig, the European trade defence director, was expected to leave Beijing today. An EU spokesman described the talks as \"constructive and friendly\" but declined to elaborate on any details of the negotiations. \"Both sides can see their interest in solving this problem as quickly as possible,\" said the EU's spokeswoman in Brussels, Amelia Torres. According to the rules under which China joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001, member states are allowed to impose quotas on Chinese textiles until 2008. The EU singled out 10 categories of clothing that it wanted protected and the quotas have already been exceeded in seven of them. Dresses became the latest yesterday. The United States will begin its negotiations with China next week in an effort to resolve its own textile quota crisis. President Bush blocked billions of dollars worth of cheap Chinese clothes under \"safeguard\" provisions. US industry officials said a deal was unlikely to be finalised by next week. \"I would say there's an enormous amount of work left [to bridge differences],\" said Lloyd Wood, a spokesman for the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition. \"Our position is that no deal is better than a bad deal,\" he said.",

Chinese state media reported that China declined the EU's proposal to reallocate quotas from future years to address current restrictions. Chinese officials, encouraged by opposition to EU quotas in some northern European countries, have requested higher quota limits. A spokesperson for the China National Textile and Apparel Council stated that reallocating quotas from other years was not a viable solution. The EU delegation, led by European trade defense director Fritz-Harald Wenig, is expected to depart Beijing today. An EU spokesperson characterized the talks as constructive and friendly but did not provide specifics. Under WTO terms from China’s 2001 accession, member states may apply textile quotas until 2008. The EU has implemented quotas on ten clothing categories, with seven already reaching their limits. The U.S. is scheduled to begin negotiations with China next week regarding similar textile trade restrictions.

        "original_text": "After months of intense negotiations, Carlyle Group has agreed to invest $400 million for a 24.9% stake of China Pacific Life Insurance Co., people working on the transaction said. A revised offer for the stake won approval Monday from the board of China Pacific Insurance Group, the parent company of the Chinese life insurer, they said. The parent company has sought an infusion from foreign investors to plug a capital shortfall in the life unit related to policy-payment obligations. Carlyle declined to comment. If completed, the deal will be a coup for the U.S. private-equity fund. In recent years, Carlyle's Asian buyout team has coped with a string of losses of senior partners and with the daunting challenge of doing deals in its key market, China. Carlyle is waiting for the go-ahead on another China transaction, an ambitious bid for control of Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, known as Xugong, which could cost the firm close to $300 million. The construction-company transaction, if it goes through, will be the first leveraged buyout of a leading state-owned enterprise in China. Carlyle has identified China as its main focus in Asia and has pledged to make $1 billion in investments in the country in the next few years. Plans to acquire stakes of China Pacific and Xugong appeared stalled recently. Last month, Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd., the Singapore government's investment company, began talks about investing in China Pacific Life's parent, casting further doubt on Carlyle's chances of completing its deal. The race to seal an agreement ahead of Temasek reflects the increasing competitiveness among private-equity players in China. Carlyle's concession to several demands by the company also may signal greater flexibility by foreign firms increasingly anxious to edge out rivals. Carlyle's agreement with the company revises a previous offer extended in April 2004. Instead of just investing in the life unit, the firm will buy shares of the life insurance subsidiary and exchange them later for shares of the parent. This arrangement quelled some opposition among shareholders, who had balked at allowing Carlyle to just take a chunk of the company's lucrative life-insurance business. Board representatives for one shareholder, Baosteel Group of China, which had opposed the earlier deal, abstained from voting on the new offer. For Carlyle, the exchange also means the firm eventually will inherit the parent's riskier property and casualty unit. In another concession, Carlyle and its partner, Prudential Financial Inc. of Newark, N.J., will give the parent company priority through 2007 to launch an initial-public offering before the life unit. Other publicly traded insurance companies in China, such as China Life Insurance Co. and Ping An Insurance (Group) Co., have performed briskly this year, as investors predict the life-insurance industry in the country will expand at a rapid clip in coming years. Once regulations allow, Carlyle and Prudential intend to increase the size of their stake to 49%. Current regulations prevent foreigners from owning more than 25% of a Chinese insurer. Carlyle and Prudential also will install a high-ranking executive at the life unit who will be responsible for day-to-day operations. They also will provide a chief actuary. Carlyle has struggled to expand its presence in Asia amid turnover among senior-level staff. Most recently, Michael Kim, who co-headed buyouts in the region, left to start his own buyout fund, taking a handful of executives in Seoul and Shanghai with him. Mr. Kim had spearheaded Carlyle's most successful deal in the region, the 2000 acquisition of 40% of KorAm Bank of South Korea, which later was sold to Citigroup Inc. Since the KorAm deal, Carlyle has completed three buyouts on behalf of the Asia fund. The firm has opened an office in India, an increasingly significant source of private-equity deals, and nabbed Rajeev Gupta, a leading rainmaker from Merrill Lynch & Co., to head it.",

        "original_text": "SHANGHAI -- When the global price of copper hit records last week, markets said it was the result of actions by a single participant. Yet the trader in question is a product of a Chinese government-run domestic commodity-trading system that has been increasingly influencing markets from London to Chicago. A trader for China's State Reserve Bureau, Liu Qibing, is being called out for executing copper-futures trades that could leave the government on the hook for big losses on the London Metal Exchange. Traders in China say Mr. Liu was part of a team that had for the past two years been running a broader market strategy that involved selling copper in London while buying it in Shanghai. Last week, the official China Daily said China has conducted an investigation and established that Mr. Liu was trading on his own behalf and not as any part of official policy. Active participation in a global commodity market by a government body is unusual and reflects how much attention Beijing is paying to raw materials like copper. While arbitrage is a common market strategy, the SRB's apparent focus on playing one market off the other puts a new light on Mr. Liu's role in problems the SRB now faces in the London market. As the SRB is an arm of China's communist-era state planning agency, its presence also raises questions of whether its underlying motive in markets is to keep commodity prices low. The bureau is in charge of maintaining the overall balance of China's major commodity imports and exports, as well as stockpiles of grain, cotton and other vital goods. The copper-trading strategy the SRB has used since around 2003, called negative arbitrage, takes advantage of price differences between London and Shanghai, the world's second-biggest copper futures market. The strategy has become hugely popular among futures traders in China. Traders say profiting on the trade depends on how far apart prices are on the two markets, and the fact that the Shanghai market is closed to foreigners. \"Last year and in 2003, people who did arbitrage made lots of money,\" says Liu Zhechang, general manager of Wan Jie Ding Xin, a small Shanghai metal-trading firm. But this year, a growing trade by hedge funds befuddled the play. Their aggressive buying of copper in London helped narrow the traditional price gap -- all but eliminating the chance to profit on negative arbitrage. \"It's very easy for the hedge funds to push the Chinese companies around,\" says Kevin Bi, vice general manager of Golden Dragon International Trading Co., the trading arm of a big China copper-pipe maker. Even before the botched trades by Mr. Liu, the bureau was under fire in China. It came in for an unusual rebuke from China's national audit bureau in September, around the time rumors of big losses on the London exchange started. It is unclear how big a role Mr. Liu played in designing the aggressive strategy of the China trades, or specifically how heavily the bureau traded the negative-arbitrage play. London dealers estimate Mr. Liu's short position in copper at 100,000 to 200,000 tons. The bureau's actual skill in trading is unclear -- even at home where it is dominant. Mr. Liu's whereabouts remain a mystery. A woman in his 10th-floor Beijing apartment refused to answer the door Friday. Mr. Liu was regularly in Shanghai and kept an office nearby at a branch of Cofco Futures Co., a state-owned company that often trades for SRB, and traders say he was a regular visitor who liked to talk market strategy. Meanwhile, the SRB has sent a number of signals that analysts say are attempts to pull prices lower. Traders calculate it has moved about 40,000 tons of copper to the Shanghai Futures Exchange warehouse in the past three weeks, swelling physical copper stocks in the warehouse to nearly five times the normal levels. It also held a rare auction of 20,000 tons last week. Moving so much copper so publicly, they say, is meant to show that the bureau has the wherewithal to deliver by mid-December the copper that traders estimate Mr. Liu contracted it to sell in London. Copper prices continued to push higher. Copper finished Friday in London at a record $4,200 a metric ton, up from $4,145 Thursday but off the day's high of $4,243. --- Shai Oster in Beijing contributed to this article.",
        "debiased_text": "SHANGHAI -- The global price of copper reached record levels last week, with market participants attributing the movement to actions by a single trader. The trader, Liu Qibing, is affiliated with China's State Reserve Bureau (SRB), a government entity involved in domestic commodity trading. Reports indicate that Liu executed copper-futures trades on the London Metal Exchange, potentially resulting in significant financial exposure for the SRB. According to traders in China, Liu was part of a team that had engaged in a market strategy involving selling copper in London while purchasing it in Shanghai over the past two years. The China Daily reported that an investigation found Liu was trading independently and not under official policy directives. Government involvement in global commodity markets is uncommon, highlighting Beijing's focus on raw materials such as copper. Arbitrage is a standard market practice, but the SRB's approach of leveraging price differences between London and Shanghai markets has drawn attention to Liu's activities. The SRB, part of China's state planning system, oversees the balance of major commodity imports, exports, and stockpiles, including grain, cotton, and other essential goods. Since 2003, the SRB has employed a negative arbitrage strategy, capitalizing on price disparities between London and Shanghai, the latter being the world's second-largest copper futures market. This strategy has gained traction among Chinese futures traders. Analysts note that profitability depends on the price differential between the two markets and the restricted access of foreign participants to the Shanghai market. Hedge funds' increased activity in London's copper market this year has reduced traditional price gaps, diminishing arbitrage opportunities. Prior to Liu's trades, the SRB faced scrutiny in China, including criticism from the national audit bureau in September amid rumors of losses on the London exchange. The extent of Liu's involvement in the trading strategy or the SRB's overall arbitrage activity remains unclear. Estimates from London dealers place Liu's short position in copper between 100,000 and 200,000 tons. Liu's current location is unknown, and attempts to contact him were unsuccessful. The SRB has recently taken steps that analysts interpret as efforts to lower prices, including transferring approximately 40,000 tons of copper to the Shanghai Futures Exchange warehouse and auctioning 20,000 tons. These actions may aim to demonstrate the SRB's ability to meet potential delivery obligations linked to Liu's trades. Copper prices closed at a record $4,200 per metric ton in London on Friday, up from $4,145 the previous day but below the day's peak of $4,243. Shai Oster in Beijing contributed to this report."

        "original_text": "It was always going to be hard to avoid controversy when the time came to mark this 60th anniversary of the defeat of Nazism. And President George Bush struck a very contemporary note over the weekend even as he paid tribute to the historic sacrifice of the brave Allied soldiers who secured final victory. True, liberation for western Europe meant the imposition of Soviet rule in the east - hence the current row between the Baltic states and Russia. But was the US really guilty of appeasement in the Yalta carve-up (and the long nuclear standoff of the cold war) as Mr Bush implied? The president was talking about Berlin 1945, but his subtext was Baghdad 2003. Yet there is no epic grand alliance onslaught that will topple today's tyrants in the manner of 1945. It would be good to hear from Vladimir Putin, hosting today's VE Day ceremony in Red Square, even some half-admission that the 1939 pact between Stalin and Hitler was at least regrettable. But that is sadly unlikely. For in Moscow, as elsewhere, remembering the war is still a national experience of finest hours and last hurrahs, with poppy wreaths at the Cenotaph, Churchill's low growl and Vera Lynn singing for Britain. France's celebrations saw a march down the Champs Elysées and homage to General de Gaulle. Germany, poignantly, held a festival of democracy at the Brandenburg Gate, where the new Holocaust memorial is to be opened this week amid intensifying re-examination of wartime guilt and victimhood. The bitter dispute between China and Japan over Japanese history textbooks is a reminder that this war still needs to be understood and remembered, above national prejudices, on the European and global level. A war that engulfed 60 countries and cost 55 million dead, including 27 million Russians and 6 million Jews, is too vast an event to encapsulate, except to recall that it set new standards for barbarity in the heartlands of the European enlightenment. It remains the war that shaped our lives, including those who were born long after it ended. We are all, to some degree, victims of Nazism and its legacy.",

        "original_text": "Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld travels to Beijing today in a bid to bolster ties with a Chinese military that many in Washington believe is becoming the U.S.'s biggest long-term threat. Mr. Rumsfeld's two-day trip, his first to China as defense secretary, will include meetings with Chinese President Hu Jintao and Defense Minister Cao Gangchuan. He also is scheduled to make what U.S. officials say is an unprecedented visit to the Chinese military's Second Artillery Corps headquarters, which oversees Beijing's nuclear and conventional missile operations. U.S. and Chinese military planners hope the visit can help underpin a Washington-Beijing defense relationship that has shown signs of fraying. Its low point came in April 2001, when Chinese jets forced down a U.S. spy plane off the southern Chinese island of Hainan. The incident sparked alarm within the Bush administration over what many conservatives say is the Chinese military's growing expansionist and confrontational stance. The Pentagon also charged Beijing in a recent report with overseeing a massive military buildup that risks destabilizing Asia. The Chinese, in turn, believe Mr. Rumsfeld and the Bush administration have been hyping the China threat as a means to crimp Beijing's rise as a military, economic and diplomatic power. It is within this context, a senior Pentagon official said, that Mr. Rumsfeld hopes to use the trip to allow U.S.-China military relations to \"come back full circle\" since the spy-plane incident. In particular, the Pentagon seeks to gain a better understanding of the pace and scale of China's military buildup, the official said. And Mr. Rumsfeld is seeking to work with the Chinese military to put in place systems and protocols that will allow for more regular contact and guard against a repeat of the 2001 crisis. \"Rumsfeld wants a positive outcome\" from these meetings and exchanges, said another senior Pentagon official who will be making the trip. \"We want to see improved military-to-military relations.\" Some Chinese analysts see Mr. Rumsfeld's visit as a step toward potentially rebalancing the relationship between the militaries. \"Rumsfeld's visit reflects a shift in his attitude towards China: At least he comes and is willing to communicate,\" said Niu Xinchun, a research fellow of American studies with the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, a Beijing think tank. Still, there remains deep skepticism within both the Pentagon and China's military establishment. American officials said they don't expect any communiques or agreements to be signed at the end of the trip. And one Pentagon official guarded against expectations of a \"euphoric encounter,\" noting that the U.S. takes a \"realistic\" view of China's intentions. Many in the Chinese government and academia, meanwhile, express uneasiness about Mr. Rumsfeld and what they view as his hawkish views on China's rise. They contrast these with what they call the constructive roles played by past U.S. defense secretaries, such as William Cohen and William Perry, who sought to expand military exchanges and joint exercises. But \"now it's all appearances, because Rumsfeld and the people under him are totally hostile towards China,\" said Chu Shulong, director of the Institute of Strategic Studies at Tsinghua University in Beijing. During the coming visit, \"both sides will pretend to be engaged, but neither side is really willing [to meet], and they won't talk about anything of real substance.\" Indeed, some independent analysts say they believe China's military remains decades away from posing a serious threat to the U.S. And they say it remains uncertain whether China actually wants to develop a global military capability similar to the former Soviet Union's.",

The Pentagon has previously noted concerns about China's military expansion in a recent report, while Chinese officials have countered that the U.S. exaggerates these developments. A senior Pentagon official stated that Rumsfeld seeks to improve communication and understanding between the two militaries to prevent future crises. No formal agreements or communiques are expected from the visit. Chinese analysts, such as Niu Xinchun of the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, view the trip as a potential step toward stabilizing military relations, though skepticism remains on both sides. Independent analysts note that China's military capabilities are still significantly behind the U.S. and question whether China intends to develop a global military presence comparable to historical powers."

        "original_text": "Pakistan and China have agreed to start joint production of a new fighter aircraft intended as a replacement for the ageing French and Chinese aircraft used by Pakistan's air force, a senior Pakistani air force officer said yesterday. The agreement comes only two months after the US offered to sell F-16 fighter aircraft to Pakistan, reversing sanctions applied almost 15 years ago in protest at Islamabad's nuclear weapons programme. The first four of the JF-17 \"Thunder\" aircraft would be delivered to Pakistan next year for trial flights, while the supply of a total of 150 aircraft would begin in 2007, said Air Vice Marshal Shahid Latif, director of the JF-17 project. China's Chengdu Aircraft Design Institute is the architect of the JF-17 while its prototypes, first flown last year by Pakistani test pilots, were made by the Chengdu Aircraft Company based in Sichuan province. \"The (JF-17) project is not only of strategic importance to the air force but it has far-reaching implications both for the national defence and economic prosperity of Pakistan,\" Air Vice Marshal Latif said. Pakistan and China were planning to produce at least 400 JF-17 fighters, with the balance of 250 of them on order for China's air force. Pakistani air force officials said that, under the agreement, half the fighters would be produced in China while the other half would be made in Pakistan. A Pakistani government official said the JF-17 project was being pursued with a view to exporting the fighter to other countries once the aircraft had established a service record with Pakistan. Western defence officials in Islamabad said the agreement underlined the collaboration between Pakistan and China, which have maintained defence ties for four decades. During a visit to Pakistan last month, Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, witnessed the ceremony for Pakistan's planned purchase of four naval frigates from China. One senior western official said there were reports that Pakistan was negotiating the purchase of another four frigates from China and was also considering the purchase of components for submarines.",

        "title": "Wal-Mart fights on eastern front",
        "original_text": "Wal-Mart's chief executive Lee Scott, back in the United States this weekend after a tour of his European operations, was quick to point out that his trip was educational, not acquisitional. Scott took in all the rivals giving Asda, his UK chain, a run for its money as the low-price option. He also visited Wal-Mart's competitors in Germany and its neighbours, paying a judicious call on Brussels while in the area. 'There is so much written about us, it is helpful for people to understand and for us to see how people see our company,' he says, implicitly acknowledging that Wal-Mart is principally known as an aggressive US giant thanks to headlines about its employment record and habit of driving competitors to the wall. They will never admit it publicly, but Tesco's bosses will have watched his grand tour with close interest. Scott's visit has implications for their business as well as his own. Other than Asda in the UK, Wal-Mart's significance in Europe is confined to Germany and this has widely been held to have been problematic, partly because the discount field is crowded by big players such as Metro, Aldi and Lidl. Now, with latest market share figures confirming that Asda is slipping against a revived Sainsbury's and could be number three in the UK by the autumn, it looks as if the UK is not going to deliver the kind of sales growth Wal-Mart demands. It does not enter new markets to be number three or four. Scott, like Tesco's Terry Leahy in the UK, knows that his home market is conquered and that there are limited options for growth, so he wants 30 per cent growth from his overseas operations over the next five years. Acquisitions will provide some of this, and Scott has a stated interest in developing new territories. Asda is finding that organic growth in existing markets is limited. It is a successful retailer by any measure and the indications are that Andy Bond, the new chief operating officer, has big ideas to expand further into non-food, but will continue to have to contend with restraining UK planning laws. Wal-Mart never sits still and Scott's observations have more significance than their casual tone first suggests. Wal-Mart's sales were $285 billion (£159bn) last year in America and nine other countries from Brazil to China. Tesco, by contrast, generated $67bn (£37.1bn) sales from 12 countries. Tesco insiders have, fairly, pointed out that Wal-Mart is the number one global retailer purely because it is number one in the US market and whoever leads there leads the world. Until, that is, the tussle for the oriental market is won - and that is before the battle for India has even begun. It would be surprising if Scott had concluded last week that Wal-Mart's best chances of European domination lay through its existing operations in the UK and Germany, which are very mature markets, or indeed in any other western European country. Global retailers want developing economies, not stagnant mature ones. So, unless he can pull off a sizeable acquisition, Scott is looking to Hungary and Poland among other regions. What would that mean for Tesco? Retail analyst James Anstead, of Citigroup-owned Smith Barney, says that Wal-Mart has the firepower and the will to make big acquisitions but would have to do so to rattle Tesco partly because the central European markets are relatively small. 'There is no reason why Tesco should be paranoid,' he said. 'It is almost six years since Wal-Mart bought Asda and there were warnings this would be the end of Tesco's UK dominance. In fact, the opposite has happened and the gap with Asda widened. If it came to a fight between them in central Europe, we would back Tesco.' Tesco has had a fairly free run at Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It is the market leader in Hungary and Slovakia - and Poland on some measures - with its hypermarket format adapted from the UK model to suit local markets and chains of smaller stores. Years of careful research, for which Leahy is famed, and of a type that propelled Tesco in the UK to where it seems invincible (last week its market share grew again to 30.4 per cent), have paid off. Leahy pulled out of France, leaving only a toe-hold in Calais, which mostly serves a UK market in any case, and has avoided the rest of western Europe because there was little percentage in taking on Carrefour, the world's number two retailer, in its heartland. 'We have been investing in prices in central Europe, mostly because we reflect what the consumer wants in those less-developed economies but also of course because we have an eye on the competition,' said Lucy Neville-Rolfe, a Tesco director. Tesco announced last month that it is ploughing millions into the region. But the Wal-Mart format that has delivered dominance in the US has many similarities to Tesco's approach in former communist countries. Tesco has had to become more of a discount retailer in those regions than it is in the UK - in other words, it has become more like Wal-Mart. It is only surprising that it has taken Wal-Mart so long to decide to take it on.",
        "debiased_text": "Wal-Mart CEO Lee Scott returned to the United States after visiting the company's European operations. Scott stated the trip was focused on education rather than acquisitions. During the tour, he observed competitors to Asda, Wal-Mart's UK chain, as well as rivals in Germany and neighboring countries. He also met with officials in Brussels. Scott noted the visit provided insight into how Wal-Mart is perceived internationally. Tesco's leadership likely monitored Scott’s activities, as the trip could impact their business. In Europe, Wal-Mart’s presence is primarily limited to the UK and Germany, where competition includes major retailers such as Metro, Aldi, and Lidl. Recent market data shows Asda losing ground to Sainsbury's, potentially dropping to third place in the UK market by autumn. Wal-Mart typically aims for top market positions in new regions. Scott has outlined a goal of 30% growth in international operations over the next five years, partly through acquisitions. Asda faces constraints on organic growth in the UK due to market saturation and planning regulations. Wal-Mart reported $285 billion in sales last year across 10 countries, while Tesco recorded $67 billion from 12 nations. Analysts note Wal-Mart’s global lead stems from its dominance in the U.S. market. Wal-Mart may explore expansion in Hungary and Poland, as Western European markets offer limited growth potential. Citigroup analyst James Anstead suggested Wal-Mart has the resources for significant acquisitions but noted Tesco remains strong in Central Europe, where it leads in Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland. Tesco has adapted its hypermarket model for local markets in the region, following years of research. The company withdrew from most of Western Europe to avoid direct competition with Carrefour. Tesco recently announced increased investment in Central Europe, focusing on pricing strategies tailored to local economies. Wal-Mart’s approach in former communist countries shares similarities with Tesco’s discount-focused strategy in those regions."

        "original_text": "Russia and China launched their first joint military exercise yesterday in a show of force calculated to dissuade the US from presuming a dominant role in global security. Fighter planes, bombers and more than 10,000 troops will take part in the week-long war games in Vladivostok and the Yellow Sea. While analysts say the exercises are mainly an excuse for Russia to showcase aircraft to its biggest military hardware client, the two countries are keen to erode Washington's image as a world policeman. Moscow and Beijing's interests converge in central Asia, where both hope to quell Islamic extremism, preserve trade interests and stifle US attempts to dominate the region. \"It's an attempt to remind the US that a different truth exists which can also be enforced by military might,\" said Ivan Safranchuk of the Centre for Defence Information. The Russians and Chinese have shown signs of forming a loose alliance against America in recent months, but defence officials were at pains to emphasise that the exercise, Peace Mission 2005, was not aimed at any country. \"The exercise will be carried out in the framework of the fight against international terrorism and extremism, to respond to new threats and challenges,\" said Liang Guanglie, chief-of-staff of China's armed forces. The manoeuvres would boost the countries' common interests and \"protect peace and stability in our region and the whole world\", he added. Yury Baluyevsky, Russia's chief of general staff, said the mission was \"an important event in relations between the two armies and countries\". The war game scenario will see forces from the two countries invade an imaginary state stricken by ethnic conflict in order to wrest control under a UN mandate. Russian paratroopers will join Chinese troops to land amphibious craft on the Jiaodong peninsula in the Yellow Sea, supported by long-distance bombing runs and cruise missiles. It is thought that China's nuclear submarine fleet and anti-submarine capability will also be tested. Ruslan Pukhov, a Russian military analyst, said the strategic bombers seemed out of place in a mock anti-terrorist operation, suggesting they were only included as potential purchases for Beijing. \"It looks more like a demonstration of aircraft to a potential client than a recreation of peacekeeping operations,\" he said. The state arms exporter Rosoboronexport announced yesterday that Russia's arms exports this year would match the £2.8bn sales made in 2004. Washington recently expressed concern at China's military build-up and the new commander of the US Pacific fleet, Admiral Gary Roughead, said yesterday he was \"very interested\" in the exercises. Mr Safranchuk said Moscow and Beijing were seeking to be guarantors of security in the region to protect trade interests and sources of cheap labour. They were also striving to ensure a \"share and a voice\" in lucrative pipeline deals, he said. The US state department spokesman Sean McCormack said Washington would not have observers at the exercises but hoped they would not be \"something that would be disruptive to the current atmosphere in the region.\"",

Liang Guanglie, chief-of-staff of China's armed forces, stated that the maneuvers aim to enhance shared interests and maintain regional and global peace and stability. Yury Baluyevsky, Russia's chief of general staff, described the exercise as significant for bilateral military and diplomatic relations.

        "original_text": "Michael Howard could not have done a better job of proving people like me wrong. He has missed no opportunity to demonstrate that, however much they agree on economic, foreign and defence policy, there is still a real difference between Labour and Conservative. His campaigns against Gypsies and asylum seekers, his ghoulish opportunism in hijacking other people's misery, remind us that we do still face a choice in the forthcoming election: between the nasty party and the even nastier one. Of course, this doesn't help us much. By voting in Labour to keep out the Conservatives, we would be exercising a positive choice as well as a negative one - or that, at any rate, is how the government would see it. We would be telling Tony Blair's people that we have accepted, as Peter Hain insists, that the government \"acted in good faith\" on Iraq; that we endorse its assault on habeas corpus and the right to protest; and that we approve of the private finance initiative and the endless expansion of airports. We might persuade ourselves that we can live with this, because there are some genuinely progressive measures in the current manifesto. But the Labour leaders will interpret our decision as they please. We will give them a mandate to increase foreign aid. They will use it as a mandate to sell arms to China. There is no easy way through this. But the route chosen by many prominent figures on the dissident left is to vote for the Liberal Democrats. Some of those I admire, such as Richard Dawkins, Rosie Boycott, Anita Roddick, Steven Rose and Sir Richard Doll, have signed up to the statement published by the musician and smart political thinker Brian Eno. He argues on his website that \"for the health of our democracy we need a real opposition. The Liberal Democrats are currently the only hope for that\". The first statement is true; the second statement might be. But neither addresses all the problems we confront. Like the choice between Labour and the Tories, a negative choice for the Lib Dems is also a positive one. As well as voting for their superior policies on class sizes, taxation and the environment, you would be voting for the further deregulation of business and continued support for the private finance initiative. And, if past performance is anything to go by, you would be choosing a good deal of slipperiness as well. They opposed the Iraq war in theory, but supported it in practice. They have done the same with road-building, airport expansion and the incineration of waste. The principal reason for these inconsistencies is that, while there are opportunities on the left, most of the constituencies they hope to gain or hold are contested with the Tories. They need to take their new votes from the right. A Labour government with a Lib Dem opposition would be pulled in both directions. And this introduces a particular problem for protest voters. By choosing the Lib Dems, you are sending an equivocal signal. Are you voting for them because you think Blair is too rightwing, or because you fear old Labour might resurface? Are you choosing them because you are a liberal Tory who detests Howard, or is it because you can't make up your mind, and they represent the middle position? There are, in other words, too many reasons for voting Lib Dem. Your voice is lost in the noise of conflicting intentions, and your decision becomes unintelligible. Whoever takes power after the next election cannot be sure why the votes fell the way they did. If, on the other hand, you were to vote Green, Plaid Cymru, Respect or Scottish Socialist, you would send an unequivocal signal about the kind of politics you are rejecting and the kind of politics you are embracing. The reason is that these parties, as far as Westminster is concerned, inhabit the political margins. It is precisely because none has the slightest chance of running the country that a vote for them is interpreted as a clear expression of intent: your choice must be ideological, rather than tactical. Paradoxically, a vote for a minor party can thus be far more powerful than a vote for a party with an eye on government. All four of them are solidly to the left of Labour. They have been consistently anti-war, anti-privatisation, pro-distribution and pro-environment. No one who has read their manifestos can doubt that a vote for one of them is a vote against the current deference to wealth and rank. Will this let the Conservatives in? No. A radical's choice for one of these parties, unlike a radical's choice for the Lib Dems, would not be added to the tally of fence-sitters and disillusioned Tories. With our grossly unfair electoral system, moreover, we can exploit the prisoners' dilemma. Most people won't vote for the minor parties because they expect other people not to vote for them, and therefore consider such a vote wasted. As a result, it is beyond the wildest dreams of the Greens (the strongest of the leftwing parties in England) to top 7% or 8%. If, somehow, this column were to persuade all the leftwing readers of the Guardian to vote Green rather than Labour, that would still fall a long way short of handing the country to the Tories who (again because of the unfair electoral maths) would need a large majority of votes to gain a slim majority of seats. (Of course, the prisoners' dilemma could produce the opposite outcome: that everyone to the left of Labour assumes that everyone else will not be voting Green or Respect, so feels he can safely do so, thereby knocking Labour out of office. But in 2005 this isn't going to happen.) A big vote for Plaid and an average of 7% or 8% for the other leftwing parties in the constituencies they contest would not tip Labour out of office. But it would send a clear signal to the party that it cannot afford to forget its manifesto promises on aid and the environment, that the war has not been forgotten and that it had better start shaking itself out on issues such as privatisation, taxation and corporate power. Though you would not be electing a new parliamentary opposition, you would still be pulling Labour to the left. This choice, unfortunately, is available only to some of us. The SSP is standing for all the Scottish seats, and Plaid for all the Welsh ones. But the Greens, who are short of cash, have candidates in only 164 of England's 529 constituencies, and Respect in only 24. Infuriatingly, they are standing against each other in 15 of these. Between them they have wasted 15 opportunities for the public to register its discontent. If you don't have an opportunity to vote for them, I would suggest taking the first stop on the following line: 1) a strong radical independent, such as Reg Keys in Sedgefield; 2) an anti-war Labour MP; 3) a faintly credible micro-party; 4) Liberal Democrat. It's a far from perfect choice. But it recognises that electing a new opposition might not be the best way of building one. www.monbiot.com",
        "debiased_text": "Michael Howard's campaign strategies, including his stance on Gypsies and asylum seekers, have highlighted differences between the Labour and Conservative parties ahead of the upcoming election. Some voters may consider supporting Labour to prevent a Conservative victory, which could be interpreted as endorsing Labour’s policies on Iraq, habeas corpus, protests, private finance initiatives, and airport expansion. While Labour’s manifesto includes progressive measures, critics argue that a Labour win could be seen as approval of all its policies, including those that are controversial. Meanwhile, some figures on the left have advocated voting for the Liberal Democrats, citing the need for a stronger opposition in democracy. However, the Liberal Democrats have faced criticism for policy inconsistencies, such as their theoretical opposition to the Iraq war while supporting it in practice. Voting for smaller parties like the Greens, Plaid Cymru, Respect, or the Scottish Socialist Party could send a clearer political message, as these parties consistently oppose privatization, support environmental policies, and critique wealth inequality. Electoral dynamics under the current system mean that votes for these smaller parties are unlikely to result in Conservative victories, but they could influence Labour’s policy direction. However, the Greens and Respect are fielding candidates in a limited number of constituencies, reducing voter options. Where these smaller parties are unavailable, voters might consider alternatives such as independent candidates, anti-war Labour MPs, minor parties, or the Liberal Democrats."

I would also like to thank the emergency services who have been magnificent today in every respect. There will now be the most intense police and security service action to make sure we bring those responsible to justice. I would also pay tribute to the stoicism and resilience of the people of London who have responded in a way typical of them. I also welcome the statement from the Muslim Council of Great Britain. We know these people act in the name of Islam but we also know the vast and overwhelming majority of Muslims here and abroad are decent and law-abiding people who abhor this act of terrorism every bit as much as we do. It is through terrorism that the people who have committed this terrible act express their values and it is right at this moment to express our values. I think we all know what they are trying to do - they are trying to use the slaughter of innocent people to cow us and frighten us out of the things that we want to do, of trying to stop us going about our business as normal as we are entitled to do. They must not and should not succeed. When they try to intimidate us, we will not be intimidated. When they seek to change out country or our way of life by these methods we will not be changed. When they try to divide our people, or weaken our resolve we will not be divided, and our resolve will hold firm. We will hold by our spirit and dignity and by a quiet and true strength that is in the British people that our values will long outlast theirs. The purpose of terrorism is just that - it is to terrorise people and we will not be terrorised. I would like again to express my sorrow and my sympathy for those families that will be grieving so tragically and unexpectedly tonight. This is a very sad day for the British people but we will hold true to the British way of life. Statement by G8, leaders of Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa, and heads of international organisations 1 We condemn utterly these barbaric attacks. We send our profound condolence to the victims and their families. All of our countries have suffered from the impact of terrorism. Those responsible have no respect for human life. We are united in our resolve to confront and defeat this terrorism that is not an attack on one nation, but on all nations and on civilised people everywhere. 2 We will not allow violence to change our societies or our values. Nor will we allow it to stop the work of this summit. We will continue our deliberations in the interests of a better world ... The world's leaders are striving to combat poverty and save and improve human life. The perpetrators of today's attacks are intent on destroying human life. 3 The terrorists will not succeed. 4 Today's bombings will not weaken in any way our resolve to uphold the most deeply held principle of our societies and to defeat those who would impose their fanaticism and extremism on all of us.

        "original_text": "THE MERGERS TRAIN just keeps rolling along. The past three months of mergers and acquisitions produced the most active period since the end of 2000, with corporations and investors putting down $665.9 billion for deals around the world, 53% more than the year-earlier period. From utilities and cable television to banks and real estate, companies showed they wouldn't shy away from doing deals even amid a lackluster stock market. If earnings improve and cash continues to pile up on corporate balance sheets, the next six months stand to produce a similar stream of deals, say the bankers and lawyers who put the transactions together. Still, there probably will be few blockbusters, such as the one announced yesterday: Bank of America's roughly $35 billion purchase of MBNA Corp. Instead, expect a procession of announcements driven by these M&A stalwarts: cost- cutting and modest geographic expansion. \"Boards are still cautious,\" says Boon Sim, head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas, at Credit Suisse First Boston. \"I don't think there are any 'concept' deals out there. The market is still pretty disciplined, and that trend will continue for the rest of the year.\" Still, activity in the second quarter picked up by nearly every measure. In the U.S. alone, the amount spent on deals surged 73%, compared with the second quarter of 2004, and rose 20% from this year's first quarter. Private-equity firms continued their march into the fray, accounting for 17% of global M&A activity, a sharp increase from 11% last year, according to data from Thomson Financial. Through the first-half of this year, the dollar volume of global deals involving retailers surged 137% according to data firm Dealogic, while oil and gas deals also leapt 137%, and technology rose 60%. \"It feels to us like there is more depth to the market than there has been even through last year and the beginning of this year,\" says Paul Stefanick, chairman of global M&A at Merrill Lynch. \"We saw some large transactions then. Now, the number of deals in the $500 million to $10 billion range feels higher.\" Some of the biggest deals came from outside the U.S. Among them were the $18.3 billion purchase by Italy's UniCredito Italiano SpA of Germany's HVB Group, the $6.8 billion acquisition by Italy's Banca Popolare di Lodi of Banca Antonveneta SpA, and the $3.5 billion acquisition by Spain's Telefonica SA of Czech Republic's Cesky Telecom AS. Those were just a warm-up. Perhaps the most discussed move of the quarter was the unsolicited $18.5 billion proposed purchase of Unocal Corp., El Segundo, Calif., by China National Offshore Oil Corp.'s Cnooc Ltd., an attempt to break up Unocal's more than $16 billion deal to be acquired by Chevron Corp., San Ramon, Calif. Cnooc's announcement came the same week as a $1.3 billion offer for Maytag Corp., Newton, Iowa, by Chinese appliance maker Qingdao Haier Ltd. and U.S. private-equity funds Blackstone Group and Bain Capital, which were trying to unseat an earlier $1.13 billion proposal from rival private-equity firm Ripplewood Holdings LLC. Those proposals were a sign of the overall confidence in the market, says Mark Shafir, Lehman Brothers global head of mergers. \"There is a lot less taint about busting up someone's deal. That's a part of doing business now, especially in the post-Sarbanes world,\" he says, referring to the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, which has made boards more responsive to higher offers in order to fulfill their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders. Should the second half of 2005 be as busy as the first, the year will go down as the most active since the fading days of the investing boom of 2000, when an overblown stock market produced total M&A volume of $3.4 trillion. Global deal volume is on pace to reach $2.5 trillion this year, according to Thomson. \"We're not seeing any slowdown because of an increase in oil prices,\" says Frank Aquila, an M&A partner at New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. Private-equity firms show no signs of slacking off. Total private- equity volume rose 54% from the year's first quarter, to $116 billion, according to Thomson. There had been some concerns that financing for a set of large U.S. private-equity deals in the U.S. -- the $6.6 billion purchase of Toys \"R\" Us Inc. and the $4.9 billion acquisition of Neiman Marcus Group Inc. -- would falter amid a jittery debt market. Those deals show little sign of falling apart. Private-equity buyers instead may have to pay slightly more in financing costs to get their quarry. \"The question for the second half of the year is whether capital markets will remain robust enough to continue to propel that level of activity,\" says Doug Braunstein, J.P. Morgan's head of investment- banking coverage and M&A. \"On a relative basis, interest rates will still be at an attractive level.\" An unexpected or large increase in interest rates could derail M&A activity, says Paul J. Taubman, Morgan Stanley's global head of mergers and acquisitions. Big changes in the stock and debt markets also could affect the overall corporate confidence that feeds deals. For now, there is nothing that looks like a serious threat, Mr. Taubman says. Across the economy, \"we have a degree of confidence, and [gross domestic product] growth is steady. [M&A]Activity doesn't seem to be out of line from where it should be,\" he says. The first half of the year has been a decisive one for Morgan Stanley, New York, which outpaced previous leader Goldman Sachs Group Inc., New York, as a mergers-and-acquisitions adviser, as measured by dollar volume of global deals announced. Morgan Stanley finished with $361 billion of deals advised, $21 billion more than Goldman Sachs. Finishing third globally was J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., followed by Merrill Lynch & Co., New York, and UBS AG, of Zurich. Inside the U.S., the players switched places somewhat, with Goldman Sachs in the lead, followed by Morgan Stanley, UBS, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., while the Banc of America Securities unit of Bank of America Corp. finished seventh, a strong showing that bested perennial players such as Citigroup Inc. and Lazard Ltd. New York's Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP was the busiest legal adviser in the first half of the year, advising on $209 billion of deals. New York rival Sullivan & Cromwell LLP placed second, followed by Shearman & Sterling LLP of New York, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP of New York and London's Clifford Chance LLP. --- Largest Announced Mergers in the Second Quarter World-wide mergers and acquisitions, excluding debt DATE DEAL Val.

        "title": "Leader: Bush in Europe",
        "original_text": "Europeans will be watching and listening closely when George Bush arrives in the old continent tomorrow. There is weighty symbolism in the fact that the president's first foreign trip of his second term takes him across the Atlantic. Dinner with Jacques Chirac and talks with Gerhard Schröder will bring him face to face with the bitterest European critics of the Iraq war. But the message he is bearing is one of dialogue and diplomacy - the themes that have already been highlighted by his new secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, on her recent fence-mending trip. The mood on this side of the pond is warily optimistic. European governments have been accentuating the positive, faute de mieux, since Mr Bush's re-election. They recognise sensibly that there is no point going on about how much they wanted a John Kerry victory. Bush II is with us all for the next four years and there are some extremely thorny issues on the global agenda. Best, in that case, to work out how they can be tackled multilaterally by the US and Europe, the two wings of an old but nowadays very unequal alliance. Timing, location and detail mean a lot when a US president travels abroad. With no disrespect to the Belgians, he would hardly be bothering to head their way if Brussels was not home to two important international institutions. Mr Bush has been to Nato before. Never before though has any American president visited the headquarters of the European Union. That is being seen, perhaps with some justification, as a sign that the US does now want to see Europe as Europe aspires to be: a more effective global actor - not so disunited that neocon unilateralists can cherry-pick willing allies like Poland, Britain and Italy and freeze out those Donald Rumsfeld sneered at as \"old\" Europeans. The EU is already an equal partner for the US in global trade and economic clout; but it has a long way to go before it can begin to match America in military strength, power projection or diplomatic muscle. It is in these areas that the transatlantic gap is still painfully wide and on these that people of goodwill on both sides need to see progress if that wary optimism is to be justified. The success of the Iraqi elections has convinced few Europeans that the war most of them opposed was a good idea; or that regime change, in Iran, Syria or other countries Mr Bush now calls \"outposts of tyranny\", should follow. There is however growing recognition that it is time to move on. Even France and Germany are likely to agree to boost training for Iraq's fledgling security forces - their contribution to the stability that is in everyone's interest. There are hopes too for movement on Israel-Palestine, but Europeans will need to be far more certain than they are at present that Mr Bush is not acquiescing in Ariel Sharon's hopes of holding on to most of the West Bank once he has evacuated Gaza. It is hard to see a way forward on Iran, where even if Washington's tone has softened, there is little enthusiasm for Europe's preference for diplomacy to persuade Tehran to come clean about its nuclear ambitions. But it will take two to perform this very difficult tango: Europeans may have to be prepared to get tougher too. Nor is it clear how the row over lifting the EU arms embargo on China will be resolved. Europeans have given up hope that the US will ever embrace the international criminal court they hold so dear. Mr Bush has signalled that he may have something new to say about climate change, despite his refusal to sign the Kyoto global warming treaty. Brussels would be a great place to announce even a modest green downpayment on the transatlantic dialogue that everyone agrees Europe, America - and the entire world - so urgently needs.",
        "debiased_text": "President George Bush will arrive in Europe tomorrow for his first foreign trip of his second term.

The itinerary reflects Brussels' role as the seat of major international institutions.\n\nThe EU and U.S. currently maintain equal partnership in global trade and economic matters, though differences remain regarding military capabilities and diplomatic reach.

        "original_text": "Hong Kong -- WHILE ECONOMIC developments in China draw most of the headlines these days, Rory Tapner's passport tells a broader story: The deal-making banker has spent more time this year in Southeast Asia than in China. \"China is critically important and will be even more so in five, 10 or 15 years, but the returns that [bank] shareholders demand today are being generated in Japan, Southeast Asia and Australia,\" says Mr. Tapner, the investment-banking chairman and chief executive for Asia at UBS AG. While China dominates any discussion of trade, commodities, manufacturing and more, Asian investment-banking activity offers a useful window on what's driving the region's economies and where they are headed. Throughout the region, companies are consolidating across borders to better compete with global players and to tap less- developed, high-growth markets. The footprint left by deals in the region underscores that growth and opportunity in Asia -- whether in Korean banking, Indonesian telecommunications or Indian outsourcing -- continue despite a global slowdown. Concurrently, Asia's developing economies are trying to integrate with one another to break away from a heavy dependence on exports to the U.S. and Europe. So far this year, Australia, Indonesia and South Korea have produced Asia's biggest merger-and-acquisition deals. Australia accounts for four of the 10 biggest mergers, and South Korea for two, according to market-data provider Dealogic. China has just one transaction in the top 10. \"Everybody loves to talk about China,\" says Paul Calello, Asia chairman for Credit Suisse First Boston, which advised Altria Group Inc.'s Philip Morris International on its $5.2 billion takeover of Indonesian cigarette maker PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna, the second- biggest transaction in Asia outside Japan so far this year. \"The rest of Asia is also very interesting. It doesn't get the focus it should.\" Each country or region has a different story to tell. South Korea's biggest deals this year have been driven by foreigners selling out of investments made in the aftermath of the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. In Southeast Asia, vigorous economic expansion and robust equity markets are attracting foreign and regional investors looking for growth. For instance, Hong Kong-based Hutchison Telecommunications International Ltd., a mobile-phone company with operations in several emerging markets, agreed to acquire a 60% stake in Indonesian cellular operator PT Cyber Access Communications in March. Australia has benefited in part from Southeast Asian companies seeking to expand their reach, as well as from domestic consolidation in such industries as natural resources, transportation and wine. Nobody is writing off China. With economic growth running at 9.5%, 1.3 billion people, and the world's lowest-cost manufacturing base, it remains very much at the top of bankers' agendas. Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd.'s $1.25 billion purchase of International Business Machines Corp.'s personal-computer business late last year was a watershed. Bankers say there is plenty afoot in China for the rest of the year. Still, the activity elsewhere in Asia shows there is other fertile ground for foreign companies seeking to tap Asia's fast-growing economies and large populations. In January, Malaysian investment bank CIMB Bhd. agreed to buy Singaporean brokerage firm G.K. Goh Holdings Ltd. to expand in the region. Similar moves are starting to pay off for companies such as Singapore Telecommunications Ltd., which announced higher-than- expected profit last week helped by acquisitions made last year in Indonesia and Thailand. And Philippine food-and-beverage maker San Miguel Corp. emerged victorious in a three-month bidding war against New Zealand's Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. to buy Australia's biggest dairy company, National Foods Ltd., with a $1.5 billion offer. In Korea, meanwhile, distressed-debt buyers and private-equity funds that bought in just after the Asian financial crisis are cashing out. And while Asia's third-largest economy is just beginning to recover from a consumer-credit crunch in 2002, deals in Korea this year have drawn competitive bidding from both foreign and domestic capital. Newbridge Capital sold Korea First Bank to Standard Chartered PLC for $3.2 billion in January. A Korean court is on the verge of selling Korea's largest spirits maker, Jinro Ltd., for $3.1 billion to a consortium led by the country's biggest beer maker, Hite Brewery Co. As this activity continues, UBS's Mr. Tapner will keep popping up in immigration lines around the region. \"The league tables, the surveys, the fee pools -- they all show the same thing: There's more to Asia than China,\" Mr. Tapner says. --- Plenty to Go Around While China's explosive growth grabs the world's attention, investment-banking deals around Asia show the rest of the region remains vibrant as well.

        "debiased_text": "Hong Kong -- Economic developments in China frequently make headlines, but recent investment activities indicate significant banking and deal-making across other parts of Asia. Rory Tapner, investment-banking chairman and CEO for Asia at UBS AG, reports spending more time in Southeast Asia than in China this year. He notes that while China remains important for long-term growth, current returns for shareholders are being generated in Japan, Southeast Asia, and Australia.\n\nDealogic data shows that Australia, Indonesia, and South Korea have accounted for the majority of Asia's largest merger-and-acquisition deals this year. Australia has four of the top 10 deals, South Korea has two, and China has one. For example, Philip Morris International acquired Indonesian cigarette maker PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna for $5.2 billion, the second-largest deal in Asia outside Japan this year.\n\nDifferent regions present distinct trends. In South Korea, foreign investors are divesting holdings acquired after the 1997-98 financial crisis. Southeast Asia attracts investment due to economic expansion and strong equity markets, with companies like Hutchison Telecommunications acquiring stakes in Indonesian telecom firms. Australia benefits from Southeast Asian expansion efforts and domestic mergers in industries such as natural resources.\n\nChina remains a priority for investment due to its 9.5% growth rate, large population, and manufacturing sector. The acquisition of IBM's PC business by Lenovo Group for $1.25 billion in late 2004 was a notable transaction. However, other Asian markets are also active, with foreign and regional investors pursuing opportunities in fast-growing economies. CIMB Bhd. purchased Singaporean brokerage G.K. Goh Holdings, and Singapore Telecommunications reported higher-than-expected profits, partly due to acquisitions in Indonesia and Thailand.\n\nIn South Korea, private equity firms are exiting investments, and domestic and foreign capital is competing for assets. Standard Chartered acquired Korea First Bank for $3.2 billion, and Hite Brewery is leading a consortium to purchase Jinro Ltd. for $3.1 billion.\n\nAccording to 2004 data, Japan accounted for 41.8% of Asia-Pacific investment banking fees, followed by Australia (18.6%), China (10.5%), and Southeast Asia (8.9%). These figures indicate diverse transactional activity across the region."

The foreign ministry said in a statement that the airbase at Karshi-Khanabad, which American forces use to support operations in and supply humanitarian aid to neighbouring Afghanistan, was only intended for combat operations in northern Afghanistan during the overthrow of the Taliban regime after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US. \"Any other prospects for a US military presence in Uzbekistan were not considered by the Uzbek side,\" the ministry said. Uzbekistan also claimed that the United States had not paid takeoff and landing fees for all flights to and from the base, and had offered virtually no compensation for additional costs incurred by the Uzbek authorities for guarding the base, new infrastructure, ecological damage and inconvenience to the local population. \"In the view of the foreign ministry of Uzbekistan, these considerations should be central to examining the prospects of the future presence of the US military force at the Khanabad air base,\" the statement concluded.

        "original_text": "[An Occasional Series] FOREIGN CAPITAL is trickling into Harbin, a northeastern city in the heart of China's Rust Belt, as investors seek more opportunity and fatter returns than they are finding in more-developed areas such as Beijing and Shanghai. But a deal for a Harbin pharmaceuticals company offers a window into how China's messy financial system and a lack of regulatory oversight in secondary cities can flummox Western investors. Chinese companies located in the interior often are less expensive and more eager to sign deals than are their counterparts on the prosperous coast. Such moves also benefit places like Harbin, because putting its best enterprises in the hands of foreign investors, who offer capital as well as modern management and know-how, can put them on the road to reform. Anheuser-Busch Cos. last year bought Harbin Brewery Group Ltd. for nearly $700 million after a bitter fight with SABMiller PLC. Mando Corp., a South Korean car-parts company, recently formed a joint venture with Harbin car maker Hafei Motor Co. And fresh signs of prosperity, from a planned new five-star hotel to foreign car dealerships, are popping up. The going isn't always easy for either side, as a deal for Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co. shows. The deal, if completed, would be one of the largest private-equity deals in China. Under its terms, U.S. investment firm Warburg Pincus LLC and Citic Capital, the Hong Kong financial arm of a Beijing government entity, are putting two billion yuan ($241.6 million) into the maker of antibiotics and nutritional products, giving the two a combined 45% stake. With the company's national distribution, low debt load and independently run divisions, Warburg and Citic see the potential for cutting costs and building a national brand. Closing the deal has proved difficult, though. Funds totaling 300 million yuan that belong to an investment company -- a local partner of the two foreign investors -- recently disappeared from a branch of the Bank of China in Harbin. The chairman of the investment company, which is controlled by the provincial power authority, died shortly after. Meanwhile, efforts to buy up Harbin Pharmaceutical's public shares outstanding have been caught up in a legal tangle involving Chinese regulators. \"There are always issues to address and obstacles to overcome. In many ways, it is these unrelated issues that have created the opportunity for us,\" says Chip Kaye, co-president of Warburg Pincus, noting that few competitors would have the appetite or the insight to deal with unexpected complications that can make the pursuit of even the best state-owned enterprises so difficult. Such problems are one reason that, up to now, foreign investment flows to secondary cities remain just a trickle. Outside investors frequently struggle with culture clashes in the workplace, layers of inefficient, often corrupt bureaucracy, and inadequate support systems, from transport to energy. Cong Guozhang, Harbin's deputy mayor in charge of economic matters and the force behind selling off much of Harbin's state-controlled businesses, says the city's economy has been expanding nearly 15% a year, although such statistics in China are difficult to verify. Yet, he says, \"over half of our economy is still state-owned enterprises. We need to solve this historical legacy.\" While restructuring a state-owned enterprise in China would be daunting, the problems are compounded in a relatively remote city such as Harbin. Direct airline flights from Hong Kong often are canceled for lack of sufficient passengers. The local population isn't as wealthy as in China's biggest cities, the work force isn't as educated in the ways of Western corporate management and corruption seems more intractable. Harbin is facing a brain drain, as its best and brightest move to Beijing and coastal cities, attracted by greater opportunities there, and private enterprise and the service sector remain underdeveloped. Harbin has strengths. It sits in the middle of a province that is rich in resources from coal to soybeans at a time when resource prices have risen, improving the area's clout in terms of trade. Recently, Harbin has become a beneficiary of Beijing's increased military spending, which is expected to boost the region's economic growth and income. For Warburg Pincus and Citic, Harbin Pharmaceutical has promise. In the past, each division of the company has been run separately, which means there is significant potential to cut costs and rationalize production, distribution and marketing. \"The margins are so high, the market is growing so rapidly and there is so much fragmentation,\" says Sun Chang, who oversees North Asia investments for Warburg. \"All we have to do is plug the holes. The potential value creation is huge.\" But supporting the company's business prospects has turned out to be the easy part. Under the agreement, the central government will continue to hold a 45% stake. The final 10% is meant to be in the hands of an investment company led by the power bureau of Heilongjiang province, where Harbin is based, with a pledge to put 400 million yuan into the deal. Because the investment fund is a step removed from the government, its participation gives comfort to outside investors that the government won't hold an outright majority stake in the firm. But a few weeks ago, the 300 million yuan disappeared, and shortly afterward, the chairman of the fund died in an apparent suicide. An executive at the fund, the Heilongjiang Chenneng HIT High Tech Venture Capital Co., confirmed that police are investigating the incident, but \"no one knows whether the two cases have any connection.\" Zhang Zhaofeng, an executive at Heilongjiang Chenneng's investment department, says the fund still plans to invest in Harbin Pharmaceutical. But the deal has been held up as the company seeks to find financing to replace the missing funds. There are other complications. The two foreign investors bought into the parent company. The parent holds 35% of a Shanghai-listed company called Harbin Pharmaceutical Joint-Stock Co., and the outside investors hope to acquire the rest of the public company. But China Southern Securities, a securities firm based in Shenzhen city near Hong Kong, bought virtually all of the publicly traded shares -- a move that Chinese securities regulators and the Shanghai Stock Exchange allege violated China's securities law. The Chinese authorities subsequently took over the brokerage house, and the foreign investors' plan to make an offer for the 65% stake awaits regulatory approval. Zhu Jiang, manager of China Southern Securities' news office, declined to comment. --- Qiu Haixu contributed to this article.",

A recent deal involving Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co. highlights challenges foreign investors may face due to China's financial system and regulatory environment in secondary cities.\n\nCompanies in China's interior regions often present lower costs and greater willingness to negotiate compared to coastal counterparts. Such investments can benefit cities like Harbin by introducing capital, modern management practices, and technical expertise.

The chairman of that investment company, controlled by the provincial power authority, died shortly afterward. Additionally, efforts to acquire Harbin Pharmaceutical's publicly traded shares have encountered regulatory complications.\n\nForeign investment in secondary cities like Harbin remains limited due to factors such as workplace culture differences, bureaucratic inefficiencies, and infrastructure shortcomings. Harbin's economy has reportedly grown nearly 15% annually, though verification of such figures is difficult. Approximately half of the city's economy remains state-controlled, according to Deputy Mayor Cong Guozhang. Challenges in Harbin include limited air connectivity, lower average incomes compared to major cities, workforce skill gaps, and migration of skilled workers to coastal areas.\n\nHarbin benefits from its location in a resource-rich province and has seen advantages from increased central government military spending, which may boost regional economic growth. For Warburg Pincus and Citic, Harbin Pharmaceutical presents potential for operational improvements across production, distribution, and marketing. However, deal completion depends on resolving outstanding issues. The Heilongjiang provincial power bureau's investment fund, intended to hold a 10% stake, still plans to participate despite the missing funds, according to an executive. Meanwhile, the acquisition of publicly traded shares is delayed pending regulatory approval amid an investigation into share purchases by China Southern Securities."

        "original_text": "Government departments across Whitehall are scrambling to pull together a financing package to ensure MG Rover closes a vital rescue deal with a Chinese car manufacturer. Officials from the Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have been assessing which grant, investment and tax-relief funding streams they can use to prop up the ailing Longbridge car maker and ensure that a deal with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation is sewn up. Ministers who visit China have been instructed to place the need for a tie-up with SAIC at the top of their agenda in meetings with government officials there. Science minister Lord Sainsbury visited China earlier this month and made clear the importance of the deal to Tony Blair and workers in the Midlands. One Whitehall insider said: 'When government ministers go to China, this is at the top of the agenda in discussion with officials. They make clear that the Prime Minister and [Trade and Industry Secretary] Patricia Hewitt's position is that they want this deal to go ahead.' Ministers and Midlands MPs are concerned that, with no deal imminent and the original timetable for talks set to expire, negotiations could falter in the run-up to a spring general election. The importance of an agreement was emphasised by MG Rover's auditors, who said failure to agree could place a question mark over the business as a going concern. They are also concerned that the company will need help in the interim: Rover sales are falling sharply and new models are unlikely to hit showrooms for at least 18 months, even if a deal is reached. Sources have indicated that ministers and officials are putting together a 'sweetener' package. One Whitehall insider said: 'There is a \"toolkit\" of things that the government has, whether it is grants, investment or what happens in relation to tax. There are a number of things that are possible, and the government has clear rules about what is permissible.' Another said: 'There are government programmes which present some potential for assistance.' Possibilities being examined include research and development tax credits that could be applied to any R&amp;D on new models carried out in the UK; regional selective assistance; learning and skills grants that could be targeted towards training; and planning assistance. However, any financial aid would be closely scrutinised by the European Commission. Last week, the government played down reports that it had promised SAIC a £100 million 'dowry' to save the deal. But union leaders are demanding the government provide at least as much aid as the £150m that was promised to BMW by then Industry Secretary Stephen Byers before it sold Rover to the Phoenix consortium.",

        "original_text": "Britain and the UN demanded an independent inquiry into the alleged massacre of hundreds of Uzbek civilians in the town of Andijan, hours after diplomats were prevented from visiting the site of the worst violence yesterday. The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, told the BBC: \"It is a matter of grave international concern that these killings took place.\" The Uzbek government has said 169 people, including militants and 37 troops but no civilians, died. The opposition has compiled a list of 745 names of the dead, and believes up to 1,500 civilians could have been killed. Mr Straw said: \"The government has one version; the opposition has another. It is of crucial importance for the stability of society in Uzbekistan, as well as for the credibility of the government of Uzbekistan, that we get to the bottom of what happened. Our judgment is that that has to be by an international and independent inquiry.\" The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Louise Arbour, echoed his demand. Their comments came after a group of diplomats were taken on a government tour of the town following a request by Mr Straw. Diplomats were driven around the area on a tightly controlled route and denied access to residents. Television pictures showed the people of Andijan behind closed gates and the officials - including the British ambassador, David Moran, and other diplomats from Romania, the Czech Republic, China and South Korea - talking to hospital workers. Heavily armed guards escorted the group during the two-hour tour and refused to take them to Middle School 15, the purported site of some of the worst violence. Witnesses have said troops opened fire on a group of unarmed civilians gathered outside the school on Friday, killing hundreds and then \"finishing off\" survivors with shots to the forehead. \"Write down in your story that they never took us to the school,\" one diplomat shouted to reporters from a bus taking the group and foreign journalists back to the airport. Mr Moran said the trip was \"not enough in itself. We were not able to walk around and talk to ordinary people.\" He said of the death toll: \"There are a number of reports from credible contacts that suggest it was in the hundreds.\" The trip was cut short by an hour and a half. According to Uzbek officials, this was because larger than expected numbers of attendees had made security a concern. The Uzbek interior minister, Zakir Almatov, tipped as a possible successor to the ageing president, Islam Karimov, led the tour and told the diplomats: \"We have already captured around 100 bandits. Some of them are already confessing.\" He showed the group around the local administration building, burned out after being occupied by a group of militants who staged a jailbreak on Thursday night, sparking the protests and massacre. On top of the building large metal letters spelled out: \"Uzbekistan is a country with a great future\". Mr Almatov said, according to Reuters: \"Rebels took hostages and kept in this building ordinary civilians. They tortured them.\" The US state department says that Uzbek police use \"torture as a routine investigation technique\".",
        "debiased_text": "Britain and the United Nations called for an independent investigation into reports of civilian casualties in Andijan, Uzbekistan, after diplomats were unable to access the site of recent violence. The Uzbek government reported 169 fatalities, consisting of militants and 37 security personnel, with no civilian deaths acknowledged. Opposition groups claim 745 casualties, with estimates reaching up to 1,500 civilians. UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw emphasized the need for clarity, stating differing accounts from the government and opposition must be resolved through an impartial inquiry. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour, supported this request. A government-organized tour for diplomats, including representatives from the UK, Romania, the Czech Republic, China, and South Korea, allowed limited access to Andijan under tight security. Diplomats were unable to speak with residents or visit Middle School 15, a reported site of violence. Witnesses allege security forces fired on unarmed civilians near the school. The UK ambassador, David Moran, noted the tour was insufficient for gathering firsthand accounts but mentioned credible reports indicating a higher death toll. The visit concluded early due to security concerns raised by Uzbek officials. Interior Minister Zakir Almatov, leading the tour, stated around 100 suspects had been detained, some confessing to involvement. He guided diplomats through a damaged administration building previously occupied by militants. The U.S. State Department has previously documented allegations of torture by Uzbek police during investigations."

        "original_text": "How disappointing to read an Indian parliamentarian's views on the recent overtures made by China toward India (\"Sour Turns Sweet\" by Jairam Ramesh,editorial page, April 18). Mr. Ramesh states that a Washington-Delhi partnership aimed at containing China would not be in India's national interest. This is naive at best, and quite possibly dangerous. While China's economy has progressed rapidly over the past quarter century, the same cannot be said of its progress toward democratization. China's adoption of a new anti-secession law that authorizes the use of force against Taiwan and Beijing's encouragement of anti-Japanese riots illustrate just how little the Chinese Dragon has changed. As America leads the global war on terror, China's investment in defense has been guided by a new strategic objective to create the means to project a credible military force beyond its borders. It has been developing a new class of attack submarine that came as a \"technical surprise\" to American defense analysts. They have also improved the expeditionary capabilities of the People's Liberation Army. At upward of $65 billion, China's annual defense budget is now the second largest in the world and is expected to expand fourfold in the next two decades. With China's rise as a military power looming over the Asia-Pacific region and Beijing suffocating the voices of dissent anywhere under its immediate control, the window of opportunity for democracy in East Asia is shrinking fast. The United States' offer for significant military aid to India is essential for eventually balancing power in the region. Since India already has a large military, a technology infusion would help modernize India's armed forces and make it a formidable presence in Asia. This is not to say India should not continue pursuing improvements in bilateral relations with China by encouraging free trade and resolving outstanding border disputes. However, India must realize that a militarily powerful but non-democratic China looms as a threat to peace and stability throughout the region. After independence India chose non-alignment during the Cold War instead of defending freedom and democracy. It must not make the same mistake this time. A marriage of the world's largest democracy and the world's largest power would go a long way in keeping Chinese ambitions in check. William T.

China's defense budget, now the world's second-largest at over $65 billion annually, is projected to increase substantially in the coming years. The country has also developed new military capabilities, including advanced submarines, which were noted by U.S. defense analysts. The United States has proposed military aid to India, which could enhance India's defense modernization efforts. India has a substantial military force, and technological upgrades could strengthen its regional presence. While India continues to engage with China on trade and border disputes, some observers highlight concerns about the regional implications of China's military expansion.

        "title": "A RISKY GAME: [BROWARD METRO EDITION]",
        "original_text": "Venezuela's quixotic president, Hugo Chavez Frias, is in the international limelight once again, this time for asserting that he's tired of \"subsidizing\" the U.S. government by selling Venezuelan crude to Citgo Petroleum Corp., a major supplier of gasoline and other oil products to the U.S. market.\nThe implication was that Venezuela is planning to sell Citgo, a Houston-based company wholly owned by Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA.\nCitgo is a profitable business that absorbs a large share of Venezuela's crude oil exports and generates billions of dollars for the Venezuelan Treasury through these crude purchases and the profits and dividends it pays to PDVSA. With its network of about 14,000 independently owned outlets, Citgo ranks as one of the biggest gasoline retailers in the U.S.\nIn statements made after the president's original comment, Chavez's spokesmen said that no decision had been made to sell Citgo.\nBut clearly the Venezuelans have decided it's a poor business selling crude at a discount (about $1.50 to $2 a barrel) to its own refining, marketing and retailing subsidiary in the U.S., and paying taxes to the Bush government, which Chavez has repeatedly identified as Venezuela's Great Satan.\nAfter all, rich gringos are getting the benefit of cheap Venezuelan oil (in Chavez's mind, at least), while millions of Venezuelans are suffering from enormous social problems at home.\nWhat can we make of this?\nWell, for one thing, the threat of selling Citgo and possibly depriving the U.S. market of Venezuelan crude fits nicely in line with Chavez's long-standing anti-American policy. Venezuela is interested in developing oil supply contracts with China and other countries, and has already signed some agreements. Venezuela also wants to diversify its contractor base, lessening its dependence on U.S. oil companies, which currently are helping this South American country to produce oil, its principal export product.\nIn general, there's nothing wrong with an oil producer diversifying its client base or seeking a share of the China market. But the muddled economic thinking that supports Chavez's \"diversification\" concept could cause serious financial losses to Venezuela.\nFirst of all, Venezuela bought Citgo in the 1980s to obtain a secure, nearby market for selling much of its crude. It now owns a piece of the world's largest oil consumer and, despite the ups and downs of the world petroleum industry, is as well placed in the U.S. as majors like Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell. Selling this asset would be a huge error.\nBy providing discounts to its own subsidiary, Venezuela is effectively giving itself an edge over other oil companies in reaching American consumers. Perhaps Chavez hasn't noticed that other big, vertically integrated oil companies also can use internal discounting of one type or another to gain a market advantage.\nMoreover, Venezuela invested hundreds of millions of dollars to convert Citgo's refineries into efficient machines for processing Venezuelan crude oils and turning out high value products. If it sells them, it may have to make unpleasant compromises with the new owners, most likely one of the majors with whom it now competes. And if these new owners don't trust Venezuela as a secure source of crude in the future (and perhaps they shouldn't), they could alter the refineries to handle other types of oil, leaving Venezuela to diversify markets to its heart's content.\nIf Venezuela decides to sell oil to China instead, it will find that China's refineries cannot currently process Venezuelan crudes - - and it will take years to adapt them.\nThen there's the distance thing. Carrying crude from Venezuelan ports to China costs far more than shipping it to Citgo via the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe Chinese, no fools, are actively looking for long-term supply contracts in the Middle East and other parts of the world. They also are aware that Venezuela's future oil production capacity has been compromised by Chavez's erratic polices.\nVenezuela, at best, could end up being a very small player in a very large game run by the Chinese.\nJoseph Mann is a business reporter at the Sun-Sentinel. For over two decades, he was based in Venezuela and covered that South American country's oil industry for the Financial Times of London, Oil & Gas Journal and other publications.",
        "debiased_text": "Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez Frias recently stated that Venezuela is considering selling Citgo Petroleum Corp., a Houston-based company fully owned by Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA. Citgo is a major supplier of gasoline and other oil products in the U.S. market and processes a significant portion of Venezuela's crude oil exports, contributing revenue to the Venezuelan Treasury through purchases, profits, and dividends. Citgo operates approximately 14,000 independently owned retail outlets in the U.S. \n\nFollowing Chavez's initial remarks, his spokespersons clarified that no final decision had been made regarding the sale. The discussion arises as Venezuela evaluates the financial implications of selling crude oil at a discount to its U.S. subsidiary and paying U.S. taxes. \n\nVenezuela has expressed interest in diversifying its oil supply contracts, including potential agreements with China and other nations, to reduce reliance on U.S. markets. The country is also exploring ways to broaden its contractor base beyond U.S. oil companies, which currently assist in oil production, Venezuela's primary export. \n\nSelling Citgo would mark a significant shift, as the company was acquired in the 1980s to secure a stable market for Venezuelan crude. Citgo's refineries have been upgraded to efficiently process Venezuelan oil, representing a substantial investment. If sold, Venezuela may need to negotiate refinery usage with new owners, who could reconfigure facilities for other crude types. \n\nShipping oil to China presents logistical and technical challenges, as Chinese refineries are not currently equipped to process Venezuelan crude, and transportation costs are higher compared to supplying U.S. markets. Additionally, China is securing long-term oil contracts globally, and Venezuela's future production capacity remains uncertain due to shifting policies. \n\nReports indicate that while diversification is a common strategy for oil-producing nations, Venezuela’s potential withdrawal from the U.S. market could have financial repercussions."

        "original_text": "Playlist Discovering politics with my father The Skye Boat Song, author unknown \"Speed bonnie boat like a bird on the wing / onward the sailors cry / Carry the lad who's born to be king / over the sea to Skye\" I learned this song at primary school and sang it to my father, who was tone deaf, which meant that all music was just an uncomfortable noise to him. Immediately, he asked me to say the words, and he explained they were about Bonnie Prince Charlie's flight after the battle of Culloden. I was too young to realise songs could have a political message. Later, he would sometimes ask me to sing it, and he'd recite the words, which would put me off the tune. Liz Shaw Snapshot My mother, my comrade, China, 1971 The photo brings back the memory when my mother and I were in the countryside, Henan Province in central China. I was 18. During that time, schools were closed when the Cultural Revolution was going on. All people in the city, students and officials, were sent to the countryside to be re-educated. One day, it was early spring, the sun was warm. One of my mother's colleagues said, \"Shall we go out to take a few pictures?\" He suggested the simple brick building he had designed as the background. He was a graduate of architecture at Qing Hua University, the top university for architecture in all of China. My mum and I sat on a small dyke by the canal in front of the red brick building which we had helped to build. I was thrilled to be pictured with my best costume of that time, a faded Chinese army uniform. My mother wore the uniform we were given doing the labour. I was so happy sitting with my mother, also my comrade. We enjoyed the early spring sun and breeze. I did not think what might happen in the future. Now when I look at the photo, I feel sorry for myself because I lost some of the best years of my life when I should have been studying at school. But on the other hand, I am glad to have had that experience. I learned many things from this hard life - and from the older people - which these days, young people in China do not seem to treasure.",

        "title": "Blair tries for elusive climate change deal to shore up plans",
        "original_text": "Tony Blair will seek an elusive Europe-wide consensus on a framework to limit climate change when he undertakes a four-nation tour to shore up his plans for a breakthrough on the issue at the G8 summit in Gleneagles next month. Downing Street confirmed yesterday that on Monday he will be visiting Vladimir Putin in Russia as well as the German chancellor, Gerhardt Schröder, in Berlin. On Tuesday he will hold talks with the French president, Jacques Chirac, in Paris and Jean Claude Juncker in Luxembourg, the current holder of the EU presidency. Mr Blair will seek to separate his G8 agenda issues of climate change and Africa from the row over the future of Europe during the tour. Officials said he believed the EU crisis should be discussed in other forums, but realistically the two agendas will intersect. Mr Blair believes he needs to do a lot more to secure a climate change agreement that the US would endorse. He admitted to MPs this week that any plan that lacked US support was largely worthless. Washington has refused to sing the Kyoto protocol setting targets for CO2 emissions. The US has proposed \"carbon intensity targets\", in which countries reduce the amount of carbon emitted for every dollar of gross domestic product. The administration has also set itself a target of an 18% improvement on this measure by 2012. But critics say these targets are voluntary and do not guarantee cuts in emissions. By contrast, Russia, the first stop on Mr Blair's tour, belatedly signed the Kyoto protocol last November, but the terms put little pressure on the world's third largest polluter to cut emissions. Russia is deemed in transition and free from any serious obligations. With the US determined not to sign up to Kyoto, Mr Blair needs to find a forum in which the US, Russia and developing countries such as China and India can be brought together. The US rejected the Kyoto agreement because it did not include the developing nations. The protocol ends in 2012 and experts nominated by more than 100 governments met in Bonn last month on the first lap of negotiations for a new deal. Yet Mr Blair needs some major commitment from the Russians, since many western economies will be dependent on Russian energy in the future. Imports from the increasingly undemocratic Russia already make up 26% of gas consumption in the EU and 25% of oil. President Putin is seeking technology deals with the west as part of the energy links. Mr Blair will find a more ready audience on climate change in Berlin later on Monday. The Germans have been leading the way on renewable energy and have been working with both the US and China to sign energy efficiency technology agreements. The German environment minister, Jürgen Trittin, has already said the Kyoto target-and-trade system \"has proved successful\". He has called for its continuation, with tougher emission cuts of 15% to 30% - up to six times existing targets - to be met by industrialised nations by 2020. But others have said it will be easier to persuade the remaining Kyoto opt-outs such as the US and Australia, and developing countries such as China, India and Brazil, to accept targets if they are not based on cuts in national emissions. The Germans have reached agreement to help the Chinese to reach an ambitious goal of generating 10% of electricity from water, wind, biomass and solar energy by 2010. The share is to be doubled to 20% by 2020. The Germans, unlike the US, are phasing out nuclear power, an issue on which Mr Blair may come to differ with Berlin.",
        "debiased_text": "Tony Blair will visit four countries to discuss a climate change framework ahead of the G8 summit in Gleneagles next month. According to Downing Street, on Monday he will meet with Vladimir Putin in Russia and German Chancellor Gerhardt Schröder in Berlin. On Tuesday, he will hold talks with French President Jacques Chirac in Paris and Jean Claude Juncker in Luxembourg, the current holder of the EU presidency. Blair aims to address climate change and Africa separately from discussions on the future of Europe, though officials acknowledged the topics may overlap. Blair has stated that U.S. support is necessary for any meaningful climate change agreement. The U.S. has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, which sets CO2 emission targets, instead proposing carbon intensity targets aimed at reducing emissions relative to GDP. The U.S. aims for an 18% improvement by 2012. Russia ratified the Kyoto Protocol in November but faces limited emission reduction requirements as a transition economy. The U.S. has opposed Kyoto due to the absence of binding commitments for developing nations like China and India. Negotiations for a post-2012 agreement began last month in Bonn. Blair seeks cooperation from Russia, as many Western economies rely on its energy exports, which account for 26% of EU gas and 25% of oil consumption. Putin has pursued technology partnerships with Western nations. Germany, Blair’s next stop, has promoted renewable energy and reached efficiency agreements with the U.S. and China. German Environment Minister Jürgen Trittin supports extending the Kyoto system with stricter emission cuts of 15% to 30% by 2020. Germany has also agreed to assist China in sourcing 10% of its electricity from renewables by 2010, increasing to 20% by 2020. Unlike the U.S., Germany is phasing out nuclear power, a potential point of difference with Blair."

In its posher incarnation, it's also the type of thing some people like to get for wedding presents or to collect and display in those strange little plate stands. For this type of person, Stoke-on-Trent is heaven: Wedgwood, Spode and Royal Doulton all have factories here, in the heart of the potteries. Nearby Stafford describes itself as a \"fine county town\" and is mildly more picturesque. Gown Staffordshire is committed to opening access to higher education. All school leavers in the region are guaranteed a place, as long as they meet minimum requirements. Of the two main campuses, Stoke is the larger, a short walk from the city centre and close to the train station. Stafford is smaller but prettier and more rural, a bus ride away from town. It boasts the multimillion-pound Octagon Centre, with hi-tech computing facilities. There is a third site at Lichfield, and Staffordshire University qualifications are offered to students studying as far away as China, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka. Courses are strongly vocational, with business being the biggest of the schools. Top-rated teaching departments Media studies, nursing and economics all do well. Makes a nod to the local speciality with courses in ceramics. Top-rated research departments Art and design, and communication, cultural and media studies were the top dogs in a so-so RAE in 2001, both getting a 4 rating. Celebrity academics Vice-chancellor Professor Christine King is founder and past chair of the Through the Glass Ceiling network of senior female managers, and co-author of the book of the same title. Head count At the last count there were 14, 675 students, 51% of them male. About a fifth of students are part-timers, and 40% are over 21. More than half of students come from within a 50-mile radius. Academic pay Towards the lower end in the pay tables. Professors of social sciences on around £42,000; lecturers in subjects related to medicine earn about £31,000. Climate Mostly temperate, if a tad damp. Transport links There's a regular bus between Stafford and Stoke, or the train, which takes less than 25 minutes. Not so handy in the dead of night, mind you. It's an hour or so up the M6 to Manchester, about the same the other way, to Birmingham. Trains from Stoke or Stafford will get you to London in a couple of hours; Manchester is 45 minutes from Stoke by train. Entertainment Neither Stoke nor Stafford could claim to be on the bleeding edge of entertainment, though Manchester and Birmingham are both close enough for a big night out. Should you feel disinclined to commute, however, you won't find it impossible to find ways to pass the time closer to home. The central location means that Stoke catches national tours on their way to Manchester and Liverpool - try the Regent theatre or Victoria hall in Stoke, or the Gatehouse in Stafford. The New Vic in nearby Newcastle (that's under Lyme, not on Tyne) is also worth a look. There are cinema multiplexes in Newcastle or at Festival Park; there's also the independent film theatre in Stoke. Nearby, there's Alton Towers - or the Peak District, for more sedate thrills. Failing all of that, you could always go and look at some china. Schools In Stoke, you could try Hillside primary. St Peter's CofE is a good choice after that; it's a specialist language college. St Joseph's is really good from 11 to 18 - if you can get in. Staffordshire LEA is a touch stronger. Try All Saints CofE for primary, then Thomas Alleyne's high school. House prices Stafford is the pricier of the two: an average detached house costs £254,000. A flat costs an average of £97,000 and, in between the two, you could get a semi for around £144,000. Over in Stoke you could snap up a terraced house for £67,000 or stretch to a detached at a mere £184,000. What to say in the common room \"Watch out!

The King's Cross to Manchester train the day before Passover, an El Al flight to Jerusalem for Rosh Hashanah, the drive from New York City to the Catskills, the Sunday morning expat bagel run from west London to Carmeli's in Golders Green ... this far we came before running out of steam. Now, though, thanks to the Hong Kong entrepreneur David Tang - a man with enough fingers in enough pies to shame an octopus on quality-control duty in the Ginsters factory - I think we're up to five. The latest is the Shabbas (Friday night) trip to the Dorchester, in the basement of which China Tang is to be found. The journey from the Park Lane entrance to the restaurant is something in itself. From the bouncer at the door via tuxedo-clad gents at the top of the stairs and past younger staff in variously coloured jackets at the restaurant door ... so closely did this welcoming committee resemble a wedding reception line that, for a few seconds, I heard myself wishing a woman I took to be the bride's mother the briefest of waits for a grandchild. Once inside, you swiftly appreciate Tang's talent for PR. This man should be chief election strategist for a political party, because he brilliantly understands the value of lowering expectations. Everything about this amazingly gaudy room warns you to expect little of the food. The style we might loosely call second Moishe Dynasty, or possibly third, with everything seemingly designed for a market one of us encapsulated as \"women with big hair and small husbands\". Heavily carpeted, with loads of black lacquer, shiny wood and smart bookcases that look fake but are not, the only authentic touches are the pieces of painted silk arrayed on the walls. Such a multitude of staff roam the area as to make the stairs seem unattended, while taking into account the solid silver chopsticks and the cut-glass decanters (for soy, rice wine, etc) on each table, and the natural assumption is that Tang has invested so mightily in the fripperies to deflect attention from the cooking. Then the food starts coming, and it is sensational. \"Mr Tang has arranged a starter for you,\" announced a suit. Oh, was that him at the top of the stairs? \"No, sir, Mr Tang is in Cuba.\" Nice of him to think of us from so far away, we thought, and set about four taster dishes - including fabulous mixed mushrooms and the sweetest barbecued pork with which this Jew has ever ushered in a Sabbath - that instantly established China Tang as a rival to Royal China, Hakkasan and the other usual suspects as the best Chinese in town. As other dishes began arriving, a party at a balloon-bedecked table struck up Happy Birthday, but with food of this quality, they could have sung a Tim Rice medley without provoking the AK-47-based fantasy traditionally stirred by those lyrics. Seafood dumplings were madly fresh and supple, stir-fried minced pigeon wrapped in lovingly sculpted lettuce leaves (a sort of iceberg origami) was divine, and \"classic steamed fish\" proved two majestic fillets of perfectly steamed sea bass (so for £34 they should be average?). One minor misfire, bland sliced lamb with leeks, couldn't begin to take the gloss off an MSG-free banquet to live in the memory, the highlight being the Peking duck. Presented on a platter while still in possession of its neck and head, alluringly crispy, and beautifully carved by a white-gloved waiter, this was as sumptuous and delectable a bird as ever wound up slathered with perfect hoisin sauce in a pancake (the leftovers came later with soft noodles). Almost as good was the \"classic fried crisp-skin chicken\" (£24), which did exactly what it said on the tin, and did it superbly, too. The lamb apart, it was difficult to find fault with anything, the high prices being justified by the service alone (it may be a 10-minute walk to Soho, but it still seems a very long way from Chinatown, where it's more a matter of Tong than Tang). Whether the written declaration \"Halal menu available\" will do much for trade I doubt, but this will be a destination joint for those of other Abrahamic faiths for many years to come.",

        "original_text": "China's third-largest oil and natural-gas company is eyeing Unocal Corp. -- the latest sign of how China's search for oil, commodities and consumer markets is fueling Chinese acquisitions overseas. The interest by China National Offshore Oil Corp. is highly preliminary, say people familiar with the matter, who add that there are no assurances a deal will be struck. It is unclear whether the company is interested in all or part of Unocal. Unocal, the ninth-largest U.S. oil company in terms of reserves, is viewed as a likely takeover target. The El Segundo, Calif., company has amassed an attractive array of oil and gas assets in Southeast Asia, but is still considered relatively underpriced. After selling off its refineries and gas stations in 1997, the company has focused purely on exploration and production, generally considered the high- profit part of the oil industry. Unocal spokesman Barry Lane declined to discuss whether there had been any discussions with Cnooc. \"As a matter of policy, we don't comment on market speculation and rumors,\" he said. Cnooc spokesman Xiao Zongwei declined to comment on a prospective deal between the company and Unocal. The Chinese company's interest was reported yesterday on the Web site of the Financial Times. The interest in Unocal comes at a time of growing Chinese investment overseas. Indeed, the notion that a Chinese state-owned company would be considering bidding for a 115-year-old publicly traded U.S. firm would have been largely unthinkable five years ago. But the booming Chinese economy -- and natural resources needed to sustain it -- have sent the country on an acquisition binge. Mergers and acquisitions activity in China, including Hong Kong, has increased dramatically since 2001, jumping from 799 deals valued at $30.4 billion, according to data from Dealogic, to 1,566 deals valued at $79 billion in 2004. That is still a pittance compared with the world-wide total, which reached nearly $2 trillion last year. The country's managers still lack much of the financial and legal experience to put together a sophisticated transaction of the size of Unocal. While relying heavily on advice from U.S. and European banks and lawyers, the country is \"handicapped by a cumbersome and time- consuming decision process on M&A,\" says Mason Cargill, an attorney at law firm Jones Day based in Shanghai. \"In M&A, big decisions have to be made quickly.\" Even with these limitations, Chinese companies have moved rapidly around the world to pursue different targets. Still, China hasn't closed a deal on major oil reserves despite its interest. China and Canada are nearing a general agreement on Chinese investment in Canadian oil resources that could be signed as early as this month by the two governments. Among its few details is potential investment in Canada's so-called oil sands in the province of Alberta, an industry executive who has seen a draft of the pact said. The accord mentions China's three major oil companies -- China National Petroleum Corp., China Petrochemical Corp. and China National Offshore Oil -- each of which has expressed interest in taking stakes in oil- sands projects, the executive said. Oil sands, gritty tar-like deposits that can be refined into crude oil, largely have been seen as a costly alternative to extraction from normal oil fields. But with improvements in technology and oil prices on world markets likely to remain high, refining oil from oil sands is becoming more commercially attractive, industry executives said. Separately, China Minmetals Corp., the country's state-controlled trading giant, has been in talks to buy Canada's Noranda Inc., the world's third-largest zinc and ninth-largest copper producer, though those discussions have bogged down in recent months. In Russia, Kremlin officials have said CNPC could become a minority investor in a new state oil company that would include Yuganskneftegaz, a big Siberian oil producer that by itself pumps about 1% of the world's crude, or about as much as Indonesia. Yugansk was a unit of OAO Yukos until Russian authorities forced a sale of the unit to cover $28 billion in back-tax claims against the former oil titan. In Africa, China has purchased several blocks to explore for oil and gas and has set up refinery operations as well. In Sudan, it runs a major drilling operation that has become an increasingly crucial supplier to its domestic market, and a cash cow for the Sudanese government. China recently signed a deal to rehabilitate old oil fields in Gabon in west Africa, an area where China has expertise thanks to declining production at its own oil fields. In Angola, it is providing the government with almost zero-interest loans in return for guaranteed oil sales. In South Africa, it has formed a new joint venture that aims to create oil out of coal, and that company is mulling an initial public offering to raise cash for additional investments. In South America, Chinese interest has boomed as Chinese companies seek to secure new sources of oil, iron ore and other raw materials -- as well as new markets for their products. Excluding Hong Kong, Latin America attracts the largest volume of foreign direct investment from China, according to a November 2004 report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, some $4.6 billion since 1993. That is still small compared with the nearly $30 billion U.S., Japanese and European firms invest annually in Latin America, but the figure is expected to grow rapidly. China National Petroleum and China Petrochemical, known as Sinopec, have moved into Peru, making China the second-biggest investor in the country's oil sector after Argentina. Both companies also have moved on to Ecuador and Venezuela. Interest from Cnooc (pronounced \"see-nook\") in Unocal makes sense for both parties, said many oil-industry observers. Unocal has very attractive assets in Asia, but is considered too small a company to get the most out of them. The market also has considered Unocal a likely takeover target for a while, in part because it is relatively undervalued in an otherwise expensive oil market -- at least until the stock shot up 7.7%, or $3.15, to $44.34 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading on news of a potential acquisition. \"They were cheap this morning,\" says John Segner, manager of the AIM Energy Fund for AIM Investments. The fund held 290,000 shares at the end of September, the last time it publicly disclosed its holdings. Unocal has a market value of $12 billion. Bernard Picchi, managing director of Foresight Research Solutions, says he thinks the company could fetch $54 a share, making it a potential $14.6 billion acquisition. If Cnooc offers less, he says it is possible another company could enter the fray. Other industry investors said the deal makes sense geographically, because most of Unocal's overseas assets are in Southeast Asia. \"I've been telling people for a while that China would ultimately buy Unocal, I just didn't think it would be this soon,\" said Rodney Mitchell, president of the Mitchell Group, a Houston-based energy investment firm. \"The whole thing just fits nicely.\" --- Charles Hutzler, Tamsin Carlisle, Joel Millman and Karby Leggett contributed to this article.",
        "debiased_text": "China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC), China's third-largest oil and natural-gas company, has expressed preliminary interest in Unocal Corp., according to sources familiar with the matter. No assurances exist that a deal will be reached, and it remains unclear whether CNOOC is interested in acquiring all or part of Unocal. Unocal, the ninth-largest U.S. oil company by reserves, holds oil and gas assets in Southeast Asia and focuses on exploration and production after divesting its refineries and gas stations in 1997. Representatives from both Unocal and CNOOC declined to comment on any potential discussions. The Financial Times initially reported CNOOC's interest in Unocal. This development aligns with a broader trend of increased Chinese overseas investment. According to Dealogic data, mergers and acquisitions involving Chinese companies, including those in Hong Kong, rose from 799 deals worth $30.4 billion in 2001 to 1,566 deals worth $79 billion in 2004. Chinese firms continue to seek overseas acquisitions, though challenges such as financial and legal experience in large-scale transactions persist. Separately, China is nearing agreements with Canada on oil investments, including potential stakes in Alberta's oil sands projects. Elsewhere, Chinese companies have pursued energy assets in Russia, Africa, and South America. In Peru, Chinese firms have become the second-largest oil sector investors after Argentina, while also expanding into Ecuador and Venezuela. Market analysts note that Unocal's Asian assets could be a strategic fit for CNOOC. Unocal's stock rose 7.7% to $44.34 following news of the potential acquisition. Industry estimates suggest Unocal could be valued at up to $14.6 billion. Some analysts speculate that if CNOOC's offer is insufficient, another bidder may emerge."

        "original_text": "A 10-foot tall animatronic rooster sits inside the glass-domed conservatory of the Bellagio, one of the swankiest casinos in Las Vegas. \"Hello, happy new year!\" it squawks in Mandarin. The Venetian, just down the strip, has wrapped a red and gold banner with Chinese characters around its 315-foot tower. Other casinos' lobbies are filled with orange trees festooned with lucky red envelopes. Today is the start of the Chinese new year - the year of the rooster - and Las Vegas, capital of the US gaming industry, is gearing up for one of its busiest periods. Tens of thousands of Chinese tourists from North America, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and mainland China are expected to flock to Nevada to eat, shop and gamble. Chefs from Asia have been drafted in to provide special menus. Slightly unfashionable Cantonese pop stars, such as Maria Cordero, and actors including Amanda Lee and Yat-Kit Choi have been flown in from Hong Kong to perform. The annual pilgrimage to Las Vegas is a growing phenomenon. As China's middle class prospers and travel restrictions loosen, the World Tourism Organisation estimates the country will become the fourth largest source of outbound tourists, with 100m travellers by 2020. By comparison, 12m tourists came from China in 2001. The holiday takes on added importance this year because it gives US gaming companies a chance to market their brands as they vie for a foothold in Asia, where they are planning casino developments in Macao, Singapore and beyond. The tiny enclave of Macao, near Hong Kong, took Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 1.9bn) in gambling revenue in 2003 - more than half the amount generated by Las Vegas - and is fast becoming a global gaming hub. Macao, which returned to Beijing's rule in 1999, is the only place in China where gambling is permitted. In 2001, the city ended Stanley Ho's 40-year gambling monopoly and opened the licence to international tender. Sheldon Adelson of the Las Vegas Sands group opened the Dollars 240m Sands Macao last spring and plans another resort. MGM Mirage expects to open a casino through a joint venture with Pansy Ho, the Hong Kong business mogul, in 2006, and casino icon Steve Wynn plans to open a Dollars 700m casino-resort in Macao next year. \"This is our first opportunity at cross-marketing,\" says William Weidner, chief operating officer of Las Vegas Sands, which owns the Venetian resort. \"We've taken what we've learned in Macao and have redesigned some of the things here in Las Vegas.\" Those modifications include developing private gaming rooms and beefing up high-end baccarat offerings, favoured by Chinese players. The Chinese new year is far longer than any other holiday of the year, leading to a spike in gambling revenues and hotel room rates for about 10 days. Mr Weidner says well over half the Venetian's 4,000 rooms are dedicated to Chinese New Year celebrants. Outside the holiday, Chinese gamblers account for fewer than 5 per cent of visitors. The evolution of Las Vegas as a more varied tourist destination helps draw overseas Chinese to the city. The Nevada Commission on Tourism and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority last June launched an office in Beijing to encourage tourism, but it cannot promote gambling, which is prohibited by the Chinese government. Instead, the office emphasises the plethora of dining, shopping and entertainment options that helped Las Vegas rake in Dollars 6.5bn in non- gaming revenue in 2003, exceeding gambling intake, according to the LVCVA. \"A significant number (of Chinese) can now afford to travel and have the desire to travel,\" said Chris Chrystal, spokesman for the Nevada Commission on Tourism. \"The market has enormous potential for us.\" The NCT is working with airlines to add more flights to Nevada, as well as with the US government to ease visa restrictions imposed after September 11 2001. The industry is already looking beyond Macao for other opportunities in Asia. Harrah's has submitted proposals to the Singapore government to build casino-resorts, as has MGM Mirage, owner of the Bellagio in Las Vegas. Thailand and Japan are among other countries where US gaming companies would like to expand. Executives will be taking heart from one new year greeting. \"It will be a prosperous year,\" squawks the Bellagio rooster.

The rooster greets visitors in Mandarin with \"Hello, happy new year.\" Nearby, the Venetian casino has displayed a red and gold banner with Chinese characters on its 315-foot tower. Several casino lobbies feature orange trees decorated with red envelopes. These displays coincide with the start of the Chinese New Year, which marks the Year of the Rooster. Las Vegas casinos are preparing for increased visitor traffic during this period, with expectations of tens of thousands of Chinese tourists arriving from North America, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and mainland China. Special menus featuring Asian cuisine have been introduced, and performers from Hong Kong, including Maria Cordero, Amanda Lee, and Yat-Kit Choi, have been scheduled to appear. Data from the World Tourism Organisation indicates that China is projected to become the fourth-largest source of outbound tourists by 2020, with an estimated 100 million travelers. In 2001, China accounted for 12 million outbound tourists. The increased travel coincides with US gaming companies seeking to expand their presence in Asian markets, including Macao and Singapore, where casino developments are underway. Macao, which permits legal gambling, reported $3.6 billion in gambling revenue in 2003, surpassing half of Las Vegas's total earnings at the time. Since Macao ended Stanley Ho's gambling monopoly in 2001, international operators like Las Vegas Sands, MGM Mirage, and Steve Wynn have entered the market with new developments. William Weidner, COO of Las Vegas Sands, noted adjustments made in Las Vegas to accommodate Chinese preferences, such as private gaming rooms and expanded baccarat offerings. During the Chinese New Year period, hotel occupancy and gambling revenues typically rise for approximately 10 days. Chinese gamblers represent under 5% of visitors outside this holiday window. Efforts to attract Chinese tourists include the establishment of a Beijing office by the Nevada Commission on Tourism and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority in June 2004 to promote non-gaming amenities, as gambling advertising is restricted in China. According to the LVCVA, non-gaming revenue in Las Vegas reached $6.5 billion in 2003. Chris Chrystal of the Nevada Commission on Tourism highlighted the growing affordability and interest in travel among Chinese nationals. The commission is collaborating with airlines to increase flight availability and working to streamline U.S. visa processing. Meanwhile, US gaming firms are exploring expansion opportunities in Singapore, Thailand, and Japan. Harrah's and MGM Mirage have submitted proposals for casino developments in Singapore."

First the good news: the company has unveiled a mobile processor designed for portable media players, reports VNUnet.com The low-power Au1200 chip integrates media handling facilities on the silicon to keep costs to a minimum. The chip maker said that it has already signed agreements with media player manufacturers to develop devices using the processor. Personal video recorder manufacturer TiVo is developing a series of handheld media players, dubbed TiVo-To-Go, that can download programmes from the recorders to view on the move... consumer electronics company GoVideo, First International Computer and Implicit Networks have also announced the development of players using the chip.

        "original_text": "THE MERGERS TRAIN just keeps rolling along. The past three months of mergers and acquisitions produced the most active period since the end of 2000, with corporations and investors putting down $665.9 billion for deals around the world, 53% more than the year-earlier period. From utilities and cable television to banks and real estate, companies showed they wouldn't shy away from doing deals even amid a lackluster stock market. If earnings improve and cash continues to pile up on corporate balance sheets, the next six months stand to produce a similar stream of deals, say the bankers and lawyers who put the transactions together. Still, there probably will be few blockbusters, such as the one announced yesterday: Bank of America's roughly $35 billion purchase of MBNA Corp. Instead, expect a procession of announcements driven by these M&A stalwarts: cost- cutting and modest geographic expansion. \"Boards are still cautious,\" says Boon Sim, head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas, at Credit Suisse First Boston. \"I don't think there are any 'concept' deals out there. The market is still pretty disciplined, and that trend will continue for the rest of the year.\" Still, activity in the second quarter picked up by nearly every measure. In the U.S. alone, the amount spent on deals surged 73%, compared with the second quarter of 2004, and rose 20% from this year's first quarter. Private-equity firms continued their march into the fray, accounting for 17% of global M&A activity, a sharp increase from 11% last year, according to data from Thomson Financial. Through the first-half of this year, the dollar volume of global deals involving retailers surged 137% according to data firm Dealogic, while oil and gas deals also leapt 137%, and technology rose 60%. \"It feels to us like there is more depth to the market than there has been even through last year and the beginning of this year,\" says Paul Stefanick, chairman of global M&A at Merrill Lynch. \"We saw some large transactions then. Now, the number of deals in the $500 million to $10 billion range feels higher.\" Some of the biggest deals came from outside the U.S. Among them were the $18.3 billion purchase by Italy's UniCredito Italiano SpA of Germany's HVB Group, the $6.8 billion acquisition by Italy's Banca Popolare di Lodi of Banca Antonveneta SpA, and the $3.5 billion acquisition by Spain's Telefonica SA of Czech Republic's Cesky Telecom AS. Those were just a warm-up. Perhaps the most discussed move of the quarter was the unsolicited $18.5 billion proposed purchase of Unocal Corp., El Segundo, Calif., by China National Offshore Oil Corp.'s Cnooc Ltd., an attempt to break up Unocal's more than $16 billion deal to be acquired by Chevron Corp., San Ramon, Calif. Cnooc's announcement came the same week as a $1.3 billion offer for Maytag Corp., Newton, Iowa, by Chinese appliance maker Qingdao Haier Ltd. and U.S. private-equity funds Blackstone Group and Bain Capital, which were trying to unseat an earlier $1.13 billion proposal from rival private-equity firm Ripplewood Holdings LLC. Those proposals were a sign of the overall confidence in the market, says Mark Shafir, Lehman Brothers global head of mergers. \"There is a lot less taint about busting up someone's deal. That's a part of doing business now, especially in the post-Sarbanes world,\" he says, referring to the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, which has made boards more responsive to higher offers in order to fulfill their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders. Should the second half of 2005 be as busy as the first, the year will go down as the most active since the fading days of the investing boom of 2000, when an overblown stock market produced total M&A volume of $3.4 trillion. Global deal volume is on pace to reach $2.5 trillion this year, according to Thomson. \"We're not seeing any slowdown because of an increase in oil prices,\" says Frank Aquila, an M&A partner at New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. Private-equity firms show no signs of slacking off. Total private- equity volume rose 54% from the year's first quarter, to $116 billion, according to Thomson. There had been some concerns that financing for a set of large U.S. private-equity deals in the U.S. -- the $6.6 billion purchase of Toys \"R\" Us Inc. and the $4.9 billion acquisition of Neiman Marcus Group Inc. -- would falter amid a jittery debt market. Those deals show little sign of falling apart. Private-equity buyers instead may have to pay slightly more in financing costs to get their quarry. \"The question for the second half of the year is whether capital markets will remain robust enough to continue to propel that level of activity,\" says Doug Braunstein, J.P. Morgan's head of investment- banking coverage and M&A. \"On a relative basis, interest rates will still be at an attractive level.\" An unexpected or large increase in interest rates could derail M&A activity, says Paul J. Taubman, Morgan Stanley's global head of mergers and acquisitions. Big changes in the stock and debt markets also could affect the overall corporate confidence that feeds deals. For now, there is nothing that looks like a serious threat, Mr. Taubman says. Across the economy, \"we have a degree of confidence, and [gross domestic product] growth is steady. [M&A]Activity doesn't seem to be out of line from where it should be,\" he says. The first half of the year has been a decisive one for Morgan Stanley, New York, which outpaced previous leader Goldman Sachs Group Inc., New York, as a mergers-and-acquisitions adviser, as measured by dollar volume of global deals announced. Morgan Stanley finished with $361 billion of deals advised, $21 billion more than Goldman Sachs. Finishing third globally was J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., followed by Merrill Lynch & Co., New York, and UBS AG, of Zurich. Inside the U.S., the players switched places somewhat, with Goldman Sachs in the lead, followed by Morgan Stanley, UBS, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., while the Banc of America Securities unit of Bank of America Corp. finished seventh, a strong showing that bested perennial players such as Citigroup Inc. and Lazard Ltd. New York's Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP was the busiest legal adviser in the first half of the year, advising on $209 billion of deals. New York rival Sullivan & Cromwell LLP placed second, followed by Shearman & Sterling LLP of New York, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP of New York and London's Clifford Chance LLP. --- Largest Announced Mergers in the Second Quarter World-wide mergers and acquisitions, excluding debt DATE DEAL Val.

Bankers and lawyers involved in these transactions noted that if corporate earnings improve and cash reserves continue to grow, a similar level of deal-making could persist over the next six months, though large-scale transactions like Bank of America's $35 billion acquisition of MBNA Corp. may remain rare.

        "title": "China braced for mass protests",
        "original_text": "The Chinese authorities are bracing themselves for further anti-Japanese protests which could become one of the biggest displays of people power there since the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989. Internet activists are calling for demonstrations in more than a dozen cities this weekend, prompting the US embassy to issue safety warnings to its citizens, and raising doubts whether the communist government is riding or being swamped by the rising wave of nationalism. In the past few days thousands of army veterans have rallied in Beijing for higher pensions, protesters beat up Japanese students in Shanghai, and villagers with machetes repelled 1,000 riot police in a bloody battle in Zhejiang province. But the main target of public anger is Japan. Last weekend more than 5,000 protesters marched against Tokyo's approval of a new history textbook which whitewashes the country's wartime atrocities. Some smashed the windows of Japanese restaurants, ripped down the posters advertising Japanese goods and stoned the country's embassy. The Japanese consulate general in Shanghai advised its citizens to \"be careful in remarks and behaviour in case of contact with Chinese people\", and \"avoid making provocative acts such as acting loudly in groups\". The US embassy issued a warning to its citizens which said: \"The demonstrations are purportedly against Japanese interests, but could involve foreigners in general.\" Instead of calling for calm, the two governments have intensified their war of words. Tokyo has demanded an apology and compensation and its economics minister called China \"a scary country\". Beijing blames Japan for the deterioration in relations. The prime minister, Wen Jaibao, said on Wednesday that China would oppose Japan's attempt to become a permanent member of the UN security council. Such comments have emboldened the young organisers of recent anti-Japanese rallies. Nationalist websites and bulletin boards are calling for further protests to greet the Japanese foreign minister, Nobutaka Machimura, who flies in this weekend on a hastily arranged fence-mending mission. According to one site, rallies are being planned on Saturday in Tiananmen Square and in the central districts of Shanghai, Tianjin and Hanzhou. There are calls for demonstrations in Hong Kong, Nanjing, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Jinan, Chengdu, Baoding, Changsha, Shijiazhuang, Nanchang, Haikou and Nanning on Sunday. Whether they will be allowed to proceed is uncertain. The ambivalence of the authorities was apparent in an unusual text message recently sent out in the name of the Shanghai public security office by China Mobile. \"Demonstrations need prior permission. Public displays of patriotism must be orderly, reasonable, and legal. Express your patriotic feelings in a right manner,\" it said. The Beijing police have issued a blunter statement on websites warning people that they will be punished if they join unauthorised marches. The organisers of previous anti-Japanese protests told the Guardian that they have had more freedom to operate and more publicity since the current leadership team of President Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao took power in 2003. Many analysts believe the communist authorities have stoked up or at least condoned the demonstrations to channel social discontent away from themselves and towards Japan. \"There is an uneasy collusion between the government and the protesters,\" said Linda Jakobson, senior researcher at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. \"The authorities may be worried that the protests could spill into something else, but if they wanted to stop the protests they could have done.\" Asia's two most powerful states are intense rivals for regional influence, energy resources and territory, exem plified by Japan's announcement this week that it will prospect for gas in waters near East China Sea islands calmed by both countries. But it appears to be the Chinese people rather than their government pushing the pace of the row. \"Compared to previous anti-Japanese protests, this is a very widely supported movement,\" said Wenran Jiang, an associate professor of Political Science at the University of Alberta. \"We must consider that as many as 30 million people signed a petition to deny Japan's UNSC bid.\"",
        "debiased_text": "Chinese authorities are preparing for potential anti-Japanese protests, with online activists calling for demonstrations in multiple cities this weekend.

Recent events include gatherings by army veterans in Beijing seeking higher pensions, altercations involving Japanese students in Shanghai, and clashes between villagers and riot police in Zhejiang province. \n\nPublic demonstrations have primarily targeted Japan following its approval of a new history textbook. Over 5,000 protestors marched last weekend, with some damaging Japanese restaurants, removing advertisements for Japanese goods, and throwing stones at the Japanese embassy. The Japanese consulate in Shanghai advised citizens to exercise caution, while the U.S. embassy warned that demonstrations, though focused on Japanese interests, could involve foreigners more broadly.\n\nDiplomatic tensions between China and Japan have escalated, with Tokyo demanding an apology and compensation, and Beijing blaming Japan for deteriorating relations. Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao stated China's opposition to Japan's bid for a permanent UN Security Council seat. \n\nPlanned protests aim to coincide with the visit of Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura. Demonstrations are reportedly being organized in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. Authorities have issued mixed messages, with Shanghai officials emphasizing the need for orderly and lawful expressions of patriotism, while Beijing police warned against unauthorized marches.\n\nAnalysts note that anti-Japanese sentiment has gained broad public support, with a reported 30 million signatures collected on a petition opposing Japan's UN bid. Some suggest the government has tolerated the protests to redirect social discontent, though authorities retain the capability to intervene if necessary. \n\nChina and Japan continue to compete over regional influence, energy resources, and territorial claims, as seen in Japan's recent announcement regarding gas exploration in the East China Sea."

        "title": "North Korea to rejoin nuclear talks",
        "original_text": "North Korea yesterday raised hopes for a peaceful end to its nuclear weapons programme by agreeing to return to six-party talks after a year's absence. The North Korean vice-foreign minister, Kim Gwe Gwan, reportedly told the US assistant secretary of state, Christopher Hill, that Pyongyang would attend the next round of talks in Beijing on July 25. The communist state walked out of the last round of negotiations in June last year after accusing the US of \"hostility\" and \"insincerity\". It had rejected US demands to begin dismantling its nuclear weapons in return for food aid and other assistance. It also claimed to fear a US invasion should it agree to abandon its existing nuclear weapons. Chinese officials reportedly persuaded North Korea to return to the negotiating table during bilateral talks over the weekend. Speaking after a meeting in Beijing with the Chinese foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, said: \"We agreed that this is only the first step, and the real issue is to make progress in the talks.\" AFP quoted a US official accompanying Ms Rice as saying that North Korea had agreed that the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula should be a goal of the talks. Pyongyang prompted international outrage earlier this year when it claimed to have developed its own nuclear weapons. North Korea said it had decided to rejoin negotiations after receiving US guarantees that it would not be attacked. It appeared to have forgiven Ms Rice, who in January described the North as an \"outpost of tyranny\". At a news conference in the Chinese capital Ms Rice refused to be drawn on whether the recent breakthrough would be followed by the resumption of diplomatic ties with Pyongyang. \"The issue now is for North Korea to make the strategic decision to give up its nuclear weapons programmes,\" she said. \"Let's do that and we will see what else comes. But the nuclear programme has to be dealt with.\" The other countries taking part in the talks - Japan, the US, Russia, China and South Korea - welcomed the change of heart. Japan, which considers itself high on the list of potential targets for a North Korean nuclear strike, urged its foe to be \"sincere and constructive\". \"The six-party talks are the best forum for reaching a peaceful resolution to the standoff over North Korea's nuclear programmes,\" said Hatsuhisa Takashima, a foreign ministry spokesman. In South Korea, the deputy foreign minister, Song Min-soon, called for \"sincere and active negotiations\". The North Korean official news agency, KCNA, said productive talks about rejoining the negotiations between officials from the two countries in New York recently augured well for a similar approach on nuclear weapons. \"The outcome of the [Korea-US] contact clearly proves that it is possible to settle any problem when the parties concerned directly come out to solve it.\" Promising to do its \"utmost\" to resolve the crisis, Pyongyang said it had reconsidered its position after US officials in Beijing made it clear that Washington recognised North Korea as a sovereign state, would not invade it, and would hold bilateral talks within the framework of the six-party talks.",

The announcement was made after discussions between North Korean Vice-Foreign Minister Kim Gwe Gwan and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill.

Earlier this year, North Korea’s claim of possessing nuclear weapons drew international criticism. North Korea stated it rejoined talks after receiving U.S. assurances against attack. Rice declined to comment on potential diplomatic ties with Pyongyang, highlighting the priority of North Korea’s decision to abandon its nuclear programs. The other participants in the talks—Japan, the U.S., Russia, China, and South Korea—expressed approval of North Korea’s decision. Japan, citing security concerns, urged constructive engagement. South Korea’s Deputy Foreign Minister Song Min-soon called for active negotiations. North Korea’s KCNA news agency reported that recent bilateral discussions in New York indicated potential progress on nuclear issues, stating that direct dialogue could resolve disputes. Pyongyang affirmed its commitment to resolving the crisis, citing U.S. recognition of its sovereignty and assurances against invasion as factors in its decision to return to talks."

        "title": "Martin Jacques: Victims of the convulsions now transforming China",
        "original_text": "The case of Lu Banglie, who was beaten up by a mob near Taishi in southern China - as reported in yesterday's Guardian - is not unusual. There has been a rapidly growing number of conflicts between villagers and the authorities, often over the sale of agricultural land on the edge of a town or village to a developer. These conflicts are a graphic illustration of the tensions involved in China's transformation. The essence of industrialisation is the shift from the countryside to the towns involving, in China's case in particular, a huge migration to the urban centres. The cities and towns are growing apace and gobbling up the adjoining land in a ceaseless process of expansion. In the early phase of Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms the farmers were the main beneficiaries, but by the end of the 80s the rural communities began to lose out to the cities, a process that has accelerated in recent years and is the single biggest cause of the alarming growth in inequality. The sense of rural injustice and grievance, fuelled by widespread corruption, is reflected in the huge increase in protests reported last year compared with previous years. Part of the problem faced by the peasants is that the legal status of the land they farm by right and custom is unclear. It is therefore open to municipal authorities to sell the land to developers for what are relatively huge sums, to the financial benefit of both local authorities and, all too frequently, local officials. There are countless examples of mayors and officials being accused of pocketing large amounts of money through such corrupt deals. A similar picture can be seen in the sale of state-owned enterprises, with former managers making off with state assets at bargain basement prices. This is one of the inherent dangers of privatisation in a state-owned economy in which the law remains the creature of political power. Russia is the classic example of this process going wrong and becoming hopelessly corrupt. China is nowhere near this, but the dangers are evident. Nor can these matters be kept secret in the way they once were. Chinese websites are inundated with details of corrupt land deals and the identity of the beneficiaries: in the summer, a rumour spread like wildfire that the son of a former prime minister was involved in one such deal. The press is also increasingly carrying such stories. The once staid but now transformed China Daily carries frequent articles on corruption, often in copious detail and with a muckraking tone. There are two reasons for this change: first, the problem is now too serious and widespread to be kept under wraps; and second, the party leadership recognises that, if corruption is left to go unchallenged, it could begin to undermine the party's legitimacy. That point has not arrived yet; the protests are invariably directed at corrupt local officials rather than national government, but nobody knows where the tipping point might be. The dilemma facing the party is that those who have the greatest opportunity to engage in corruption are its own members. It is they who run the local authorities, the state-owned companies and the major public institutions. Once the perks of party membership were tempting but hardly overwhelming. But now party membership can offer - at least for some - the prospect of enormous riches if the member is prepared to take advantage of the increasingly blurred line between public and private wealth afforded by privatisation; in their new role as developer, officials make off with the state silver or perhaps take an illicit cut from a deal. The ability of the party leadership to fight and contain such corruption is limited by the fact that it has become so endemic. Once the old Maoist shibboleths would have been enough to maintain moral virtue, but the new God is Mammon and holding the line and preventing the party becoming too corrupt has become a far more difficult, though not yet impossible, task. The problem facing the peasants in Taishi - and replicated in numerous examples across China - is not only a local authority that is about to be enriched by selling off farmland, but also a group of village officials who would appear to have a big financial stake in the deal. According to yesterday's report, among the gang who beat up Lu Banglie were uniformed police. In other words, local officials are using the police in nefarious and covert ways to try to intimidate local opposition to the deal. The growing rural opposition coincides with the first sprouts of democracy in China in the form of the newly elected village representatives, of whom Lu Banglie is one. Not surprisingly, this movement is deeply unpopular with the local-authority chiefs; it demonstrates the potential of the new village councils as representatives of the people in the face of corrupt local power. Taishi is a microcosm of the convulsive changes and resulting conflicts taking place in China. The peasants may be fighting a rearguard action, but their protests have worried the national leadership and could yet persuade it to take a tougher line on corruption and inequality. · Martin Jacques is a visiting scholar at Renmin University, Beijing Martinjacques1@aol.com",
        "debiased_text": "A case involving Lu Banglie, who was reportedly assaulted by a group near Taishi in southern China, has been documented. Such incidents reflect broader tensions arising from land disputes between villagers and local authorities, often related to the sale of agricultural land for development. These disputes occur amid China's urbanization and industrialization, which have led to significant rural-to-urban migration and urban expansion. Agricultural communities have increasingly faced challenges in retaining land rights, with municipal authorities often selling land to developers. Legal ambiguities regarding land ownership have contributed to these disputes. Reports indicate a rise in protests linked to corruption allegations involving local officials and land sales. Corruption has also been noted in the privatization of state-owned enterprises. While media coverage of corruption has increased, addressing these issues remains a challenge for local and national authorities. In Taishi, local officials, including police, were reported to be involved in the altercation with Lu Banglie, who is an elected village representative. This incident highlights tensions between newly established village councils and local authorities. The situation in Taishi mirrors broader conflicts in China related to governance, land use, and economic disparities."

        "original_text": "THE MERGERS TRAIN just keeps rolling along. The past three months of mergers and acquisitions produced the most active period since the end of 2000, with corporations and investors putting down $665.9 billion for deals around the world, 53% more than the year-earlier period. From utilities and cable television to banks and real estate, companies showed they wouldn't shy away from doing deals even amid a lackluster stock market. If earnings improve and cash continues to pile up on corporate balance sheets, the next six months stand to produce a similar stream of deals, say the bankers and lawyers who put the transactions together. Still, there probably will be few blockbusters, such as the one announced yesterday: Bank of America's roughly $35 billion purchase of MBNA Corp. Instead, expect a procession of announcements driven by these M&A stalwarts: cost- cutting and modest geographic expansion. \"Boards are still cautious,\" says Boon Sim, head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas, at Credit Suisse First Boston. \"I don't think there are any 'concept' deals out there. The market is still pretty disciplined, and that trend will continue for the rest of the year.\" Still, activity in the second quarter picked up by nearly every measure. In the U.S. alone, the amount spent on deals surged 73%, compared with the second quarter of 2004, and rose 20% from this year's first quarter. Private-equity firms continued their march into the fray, accounting for 17% of global M&A activity, a sharp increase from 11% last year, according to data from Thomson Financial. Through the first-half of this year, the dollar volume of global deals involving retailers surged 137% according to data firm Dealogic, while oil and gas deals also leapt 137%, and technology rose 60%. \"It feels to us like there is more depth to the market than there has been even through last year and the beginning of this year,\" says Paul Stefanick, chairman of global M&A at Merrill Lynch. \"We saw some large transactions then. Now, the number of deals in the $500 million to $10 billion range feels higher.\" Some of the biggest deals came from outside the U.S. Among them were the $18.3 billion purchase by Italy's UniCredito Italiano SpA of Germany's HVB Group, the $6.8 billion acquisition by Italy's Banca Popolare di Lodi of Banca Antonveneta SpA, and the $3.5 billion acquisition by Spain's Telefonica SA of Czech Republic's Cesky Telecom AS. Those were just a warm-up. Perhaps the most discussed move of the quarter was the unsolicited $18.5 billion proposed purchase of Unocal Corp., El Segundo, Calif., by China National Offshore Oil Corp.'s Cnooc Ltd., an attempt to break up Unocal's more than $16 billion deal to be acquired by Chevron Corp., San Ramon, Calif. Cnooc's announcement came the same week as a $1.3 billion offer for Maytag Corp., Newton, Iowa, by Chinese appliance maker Qingdao Haier Ltd. and U.S. private-equity funds Blackstone Group and Bain Capital, which were trying to unseat an earlier $1.13 billion proposal from rival private-equity firm Ripplewood Holdings LLC. Those proposals were a sign of the overall confidence in the market, says Mark Shafir, Lehman Brothers global head of mergers. \"There is a lot less taint about busting up someone's deal. That's a part of doing business now, especially in the post-Sarbanes world,\" he says, referring to the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, which has made boards more responsive to higher offers in order to fulfill their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders. Should the second half of 2005 be as busy as the first, the year will go down as the most active since the fading days of the investing boom of 2000, when an overblown stock market produced total M&A volume of $3.4 trillion. Global deal volume is on pace to reach $2.5 trillion this year, according to Thomson. \"We're not seeing any slowdown because of an increase in oil prices,\" says Frank Aquila, an M&A partner at New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. Private-equity firms show no signs of slacking off. Total private- equity volume rose 54% from the year's first quarter, to $116 billion, according to Thomson. There had been some concerns that financing for a set of large U.S. private-equity deals in the U.S. -- the $6.6 billion purchase of Toys \"R\" Us Inc. and the $4.9 billion acquisition of Neiman Marcus Group Inc. -- would falter amid a jittery debt market. Those deals show little sign of falling apart. Private-equity buyers instead may have to pay slightly more in financing costs to get their quarry. \"The question for the second half of the year is whether capital markets will remain robust enough to continue to propel that level of activity,\" says Doug Braunstein, J.P. Morgan's head of investment- banking coverage and M&A. \"On a relative basis, interest rates will still be at an attractive level.\" An unexpected or large increase in interest rates could derail M&A activity, says Paul J. Taubman, Morgan Stanley's global head of mergers and acquisitions. Big changes in the stock and debt markets also could affect the overall corporate confidence that feeds deals. For now, there is nothing that looks like a serious threat, Mr. Taubman says. Across the economy, \"we have a degree of confidence, and [gross domestic product] growth is steady. [M&A]Activity doesn't seem to be out of line from where it should be,\" he says. The first half of the year has been a decisive one for Morgan Stanley, New York, which outpaced previous leader Goldman Sachs Group Inc., New York, as a mergers-and-acquisitions adviser, as measured by dollar volume of global deals announced. Morgan Stanley finished with $361 billion of deals advised, $21 billion more than Goldman Sachs. Finishing third globally was J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., followed by Merrill Lynch & Co., New York, and UBS AG, of Zurich. Inside the U.S., the players switched places somewhat, with Goldman Sachs in the lead, followed by Morgan Stanley, UBS, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., while the Banc of America Securities unit of Bank of America Corp. finished seventh, a strong showing that bested perennial players such as Citigroup Inc. and Lazard Ltd. New York's Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP was the busiest legal adviser in the first half of the year, advising on $209 billion of deals. New York rival Sullivan & Cromwell LLP placed second, followed by Shearman & Sterling LLP of New York, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP of New York and London's Clifford Chance LLP. --- Largest Announced Mergers in the Second Quarter World-wide mergers and acquisitions, excluding debt DATE DEAL Val.

        "debiased_text": "The past three months marked the most active period for mergers and acquisitions since late 2000, with global deal volume reaching $665.9 billion, a 53% increase compared to the same period the previous year. Activity spanned multiple sectors, including utilities, cable television, banking, and real estate. Bankers and lawyers involved in these transactions suggest that if earnings improve and corporate cash reserves continue to grow, similar deal activity may persist over the next six months. However, major deals like Bank of America's $35 billion acquisition of MBNA Corp. are expected to be rare, with most transactions driven by cost-cutting and moderate geographic expansion. \n\nAccording to Boon Sim, head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas at Credit Suisse First Boston, boards remain cautious, focusing on disciplined deal-making rather than speculative transactions.

        "original_text": "Taiwan prosecutors are investigating whether opposition politicians are guilty of treason by agreeing with Beijing to work towards closer cross-Strait ties. The Taiwanese cabinet said yesterday that it would tighten enforcement of restrictions on cross-Strait trade and investment and postpone planned liberalisation steps to reflect its fury over China's new anti- secession law. Taipei's move is part of an attempt to assert its jurisdiction amid growing pressure from the opposition and the business community to expand economic exchanges with China. Shih Mao-lin, justice minister, said yesterday that prosecutors were investigating Chiang Pin-kung, the Kuomintang vice-chairman who led the delegation to Beijing last week, for alleged treason. \"Individuals or private groups are prohibited from forging agreements with foreign governments under the criminal code,\" Mr Shih said. Treason carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Separately, Mr Chiang is being investigated under the Mainland Relations Act which carries fines of up to TDollars 2m (Dollars 63,000, Euros 49,000, Pounds 33,700) or jail sentences of up to five years for citizens or non-governmental bodies who negotiate with Chinese authorities without government authorisation. The items mentioned in the KMT's \"consensus\" with the Chinese leadership - such as pledges to protect Taiwanese business interests in China, increase agricultural exports to the mainland or work towards direct cross-Strait flights - were no more than vague targets the Taiwanese government named as policy goals. But as the KMT's visit came after China passed an anti-secession law enshrining its threat of force should the island seek permanent separation from the mainland, the government perceives the opposition's move as a challenge to its jurisdiction that could proliferate. In addition, the government claims China is holding Taiwanese business interests on the mainland hostage by asking them to declare their support for anti-secession. Taiwanese companies have invested more than Dollars 70bn (Euros 54bn, Pounds 37bn) on the mainland. China has surpassed the US as Taiwan's biggest export destination. Hsu Wen-lung, founder of the Chimei Group recently publicly revoked his support for Chen Shui-bian, Taiwan's pro-independence- minded president, lauded the anti-secession law and backed Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of China. Mr Hsu had been the last prominent businessman openly committed to Taiwan independence in spite of the island's growing economic dependence on China. Other Taiwanese companies have quietly circumvented restrictions on investment in China. Only half of the Dollars 70bn estimated by the central bank is approved by the Taiwanese government. The cabinet said yesterday that in the face of the pressure on the island's sovereignty created by the anti-secession law, it would adjust its cross-Strait economic policies. \"Our legislation defines China as a hostile regime. But the state of economic exchanges across the Strait is out of step with this,\" said Cho Jung- tai, cabinet spokesman. For areas of cross-Strait contacts in which Taiwanese laws were difficult or impossible to enforce, liberalisation steps would be delayed and enforcement strengthened, he said.",
        "debiased_text": "Taiwan prosecutors are examining whether opposition politicians violated laws by engaging in discussions with Beijing regarding cross-Strait relations. The Taiwanese cabinet announced it would enhance enforcement of existing cross-Strait trade and investment regulations and delay planned liberalization measures following China's enactment of an anti-secession law. Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin stated that prosecutors are investigating Kuomintang vice-chairman Chiang Pin-kung, who recently led a delegation to Beijing, for potential legal violations. Under Taiwan's criminal code, private agreements with foreign governments are prohibited. Treason convictions can result in life imprisonment. Separately, Chiang is being investigated under the Mainland Relations Act, which imposes penalties of up to T$2 million or five years' imprisonment for unauthorized negotiations with Chinese authorities. The Kuomintang delegation's discussions with Chinese officials included topics such as protection for Taiwanese businesses in China, increased agricultural exports, and direct cross-Strait flights—objectives that overlap with some Taiwanese government policy goals. The investigation follows passage of China's anti-secession law, which authorizes the use of force if Taiwan seeks permanent separation. Taiwanese officials have expressed concerns about businesses being pressured to declare support for the anti-secession law. Taiwanese investment in mainland China exceeds $70 billion, with China now being Taiwan's largest export market. Chimei Group founder Hsu Wen-lung recently withdrew support for President Chen Shui-bian and expressed agreement with Beijing's position on Taiwan. Estimates suggest approximately half of Taiwanese investment in China has been officially approved. The cabinet stated it would reassess cross-Strait economic policies in response to the anti-secession law, with spokesman Cho Jung-tai noting that current economic exchanges with China present challenges relative to Taiwan's legal framework defining China as a hostile regime. Enforcement will be strengthened in areas where Taiwanese law is difficult to implement, and liberalization measures will be postponed."

        "title": "Jackie Ashley: It isn't treason to discuss the future of the leadership",
        "original_text": "Here are some news stories so predictable they are barely worth reporting: spring arrives eventually; the Queen wears a hat; the Conservatives have a bit of leadership turmoil; and the parliamentary Labour party gives a ringing endorsement to the prime minister. The PLP is a fine institution, but these days it is about as likely a forum for robust dissent as Louis XIV's breakfast salon. Although yesterday's meeting was, by all accounts, less stage-managed than usual, Tony Blair will have welcomed its support after weeks of being shouted at by impertinent voters and broadcasters. But there are also signs that he is too shrewd a man to be totally reassured by it. For the reality is that unease is widespread in the parliamentary party; and for very good reasons. There is no projected coup d'etat, nor any likelihood of one, nor would it be in the interests of the government or anyone else... except those squabbling Tories. Brownites are not assassins. Gordon Brown may grumble about Blair's behaviour, but on every occasion, whether it was difficult votes before the election campaign or the day-in, day-out support he gave during it, he has been supportive, not destructive. Both men grew up in the shadow of Margaret Thatcher's political dominance; both know how destructive the coup against her was to the Conservative party. So forget the notion of a clutch of grim cabinet ministers filing into Blair's Commons office to tell him to go this autumn. Forget stalking horses or a campaign of disruption. The chancellor wants to inherit a united, confident party, not the demoralised aftermath of a private punch-up. And yet a strange notion has got about that the election victory makes any talk of Blair quitting little less than treason, and certainly unconstitutional. This is bizarre. For one thing, under what part of our constitution does a general election confer individual and personal authority rather than parliamentary authority? The people who now treat the prime minister as if he had stood under the American system as president are the same people who routinely criticise the presidentialism creeping into British politics. In which case, let's just drop it. But second, even if you do regard a parliamentary election as having mutated into a national leadership election, how can you simply say that Blair won it? Day in, day out, and particularly on the bad days, Brown was alongside him, protecting him. Every poll showed that Brown was more trusted, more popular. He tore up his schedule to come to Blair's rescue, and even backed him over the Iraq war and its run-up. Is it not a bit early to erase all this from the collective memory? Indeed, let us be clear: had the election somehow been a referendum on Blair, without the Labour party featuring on ballot papers, he would have lost it. This victory, which would have been far greater without Iraq, was Labour's victory and not simply Blair's. He may have kept some voters with the party. He undoubtedly lost others. You don't have to go back to Bennite notions of the absolute power of general management committees to feel that Labour, collectively, has an absolute right to discuss the future of its own leadership. That might have been called treason in Bourbon France, but here and now it's democratic politics as usual. The real question is: what is best done to renew and strengthen Labour, expand the party's shrunken base of support and ensure that at the next election the Tory total falls back again? There are three key areas to look at. First, on public services, \"choice\" has proved to be an abstract and increasingly dangerous way of selling improvement. In most parts of the country, it makes neither economic nor practical sense to have a large choice of secondary schools or major hospitals. What people want is a better local service. Labour has put in the money, knows the system, and can deliver on this. To get distracted by what is essentially an ideological argument about increasing private-sector involvement smacks of the politics of contending thinktanks. \"Personalisation\" is just jargon: if it means helping people as individuals then fine - though under the old NHS was a person not treated like a person? If it means bringing the full force of the consumerist choice that we get in the high street into the public services, then it is nonsense. If Labour in power wants to expand support for its vital programme of rebuilding the public services, it needs a period of unideological, self-confident advance, giving more authority to local managers and headteachers. Then Europe - the next obvious crisis coming towards us. The French, the Dutch or others could scupper the new EU constitution, but a British referendum seems likely. This remains a strongly Eurosceptic country, but the mix of Euroscepticism is changing. It is a bit less the dandruff-on-blazer brigade and a bit more the economic and business fear of being locked into a sclerotic economic bloc, just when the challenge from China and India, never mind the flat-tax countries of eastern Europe, is building to a head. One way or another, the EU will have to be rethought a bit by leaders who are economically literate, tough-minded and not in love with Brussels. Brown is undisputedly the best-placed man in government to reassure British voters. Last, what lay behind the worries about \"Iraq\" and \"trust\" in this election, and drove so many Labour people to vote Liberal Democrat, was a more profound worry about the style of government, the belief that it had become too presidential, too reliant on a cabal of advisers and cronies, and insufficiently interested in cabinet or Commons. This worry was strongly articulated by the Butler report; it seethes poisonously on the pages of the Daily Mail; it has strongly resurfaced following the post-election reshuffle. If Labour is to be well placed to win a fourth term, and to deserve it, then a striking shift of style is needed. The strongest argument made against the chancellor is that he too has worked with a clique or cabal, and has not been notable in reaching out - indeed, that he is naturally authoritarian and dogmatic. But Brown knows very well that these arguments have become central to his likely success or failure as prime minister, if and when he gets the job. He has already begun to talk about restoring parliamentary authority. None of this is treason. None of it is plotting. All of it is obvious to the vast majority of Labour MPs. It is the future they are discussing and which Blair needs to confront head-on. He told the PLP yesterday of his desire for a \"stable and orderly transition\". Aside from the headbangers who want Blair to go tomorrow and the headbangers who want him to serve four more years, that's what most of the PLP wants too. Amid all the emotion swilling about, let's remember the election slogan - forward, not back.",
        "debiased_text": "The Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) recently expressed support for Prime Minister Tony Blair following a meeting that was reportedly less stage-managed than usual. This comes after weeks of public criticism directed at Blair by voters and media outlets. While no leadership challenge is anticipated within the Labour Party, there are indications of unease among some MPs regarding the party's direction. Chancellor Gordon Brown has consistently supported Blair, including during difficult votes and the election campaign. Both leaders, having experienced the Conservative Party's internal conflicts during Margaret Thatcher's tenure, appear unlikely to engage in disruptive leadership disputes. Brown is said to prioritize party unity over internal conflict. Following Labour's election victory, discussions have emerged about the appropriate timing for leadership transitions. Under the UK's parliamentary system, electoral victories are won by parties rather than individual leaders. Polls indicated higher public trust in Brown compared to Blair during the campaign. Labour's election success is attributed to the party collectively, with both leaders contributing to the outcome. Current discussions within Labour focus on three policy areas: improving public services through local management rather than ideological debates about privatization, addressing concerns about the EU constitution ahead of a potential referendum, and reconsidering governing styles following criticisms about centralized decision-making. Blair has mentioned plans for a \"stable and orderly transition,\" a position reportedly shared by most PLP members."

        "original_text": "HONG KONG -- China's export juggernaut picked up momentum in August, dashing any expectations that a small currency revaluation on July 21 would act as a speed bump to slow it down. When China allowed a 2.1% appreciation of the yuan against the dollar in July, many economists predicted that such a small move would have negligible impact on exports. In fact, exports showed no sign of slackening in the first full month after the revaluation. Exports in August hit $67.82 billion, which was 3.4% higher than July's $65.6 billion and 32% higher than those of August 2004. Imports in August totaled $57.78 billion, up 23% from a year earlier, giving China a monthly surplus of $10.04 billion, according to data announced yesterday by the Ministry of Commerce. China now faces the prospect of more-intense pressure from the U.S. and other major trading partners for a steeper currency appreciation. Economists warn that support in the U.S. Congress for protectionist trade policies, muted somewhat after China's revaluation, could bubble up again. Chinese trade negotiators are heading to the U.S. at the end of this month to try to reach a textile agreement in the face of unilateral curbs on surging Chinese exports. Their goal is to negotiate an accord similar to one agreed to with the European Union that guarantees steady expansion of China's textile exports within quota limits. An earlier EU-China textile agreement ran aground when annual quotas were filled within weeks as European retailers rushed to fill their shelves before the winter shopping season, leaving some 80 million items of surplus clothing piling up at European ports. The top EU trade official, Peter Mandelson, negotiated a compromise deal last week to allow the excess into Europe, and the pact was quickly approved by EU member governments. The EU's executive arm, the European Commission, yesterday approved the textile accord, paving the way for the stranded bras, sweaters and trousers to be released beginning tomorrow. Also yesterday, China's National Bureau of Statistics said the country's consumer prices in August rose 1.3% from a year earlier, down from annualized growth of 1.8% in July, largely as a result of falling food prices. Slowing inflation also reflects a market glut of everything from steel to autos and household appliances as a result of overinvestment. For the first eight months of this year, consumer prices grew 2.1% from a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said in a statement. The August trade data offered some comfort to Beijing authorities as the pace of imports picked up. Imports are the key to bringing down China's trade surplus, which has ballooned this year because imports have grown far more slowly than exports. Rising imports could indicate that Chinese companies are building up inventories again. Many companies had put off overseas purchases on expectations that the yuan could strengthen more, making imports cheaper in local currency terms. At the same time, corporate spending has been crimped by a government-orchestrated austerity program that kicked in last year to cool the economy, particularly in real estate. In recent years huge trade surpluses with the U.S. and Europe have been largely offset by deficits with much of Asia, giving China only modest overall surpluses. Investment has been the main driver of growth. For the first eight months of this year, China's trade surplus totaled $60.22 billion, the Commerce Ministry said, compared with a deficit of $1.1 billion during the same period last year. The surplus for all of 2004 was $32 billion. Chinese exports usually surge during the final quarter of the year as factories rush out Christmas orders. That means the surplus for the whole of this year easily could exceed $100 billion. In the January-to-August period, exports rose 32% from a year earlier to $475.67 billion, while imports were 15% higher at $415.45 billion, the Commerce Ministry said.",
        "debiased_text": "HONG KONG -- China's exports increased in August following a 2.1% appreciation of the yuan against the dollar in July. According to data released by the Ministry of Commerce, exports reached $67.82 billion in August, a 3.4% increase from July's $65.6 billion and a 32% rise compared to August 2004. Imports for the same month totaled $57.78 billion, up 23% year-on-year, resulting in a trade surplus of $10.04 billion. The U.S. and other major trading partners may exert further pressure for additional currency adjustments. Chinese trade negotiators will travel to the U.S. later this month to discuss textile export restrictions and aim to reach an agreement similar to the one signed with the European Union. A previous EU-China textile agreement encountered logistical challenges when annual quotas were quickly exhausted, leading to a surplus of clothing items at European ports. EU officials later approved a revised agreement to address the backlog. Separately, China's National Bureau of Statistics reported a 1.3% year-on-year rise in consumer prices for August, down from 1.8% in July, partly due to declining food prices. Over the first eight months of 2023, consumer prices increased by 2.1% compared to the previous year. The trade surplus for January to August amounted to $60.22 billion, a significant increase from a $1.1 billion deficit during the same period in 2024. Exports for this period rose 32% year-on-year to $475.67 billion, while imports grew 15% to $415.45 billion."

        "title": "China admits toxic spill is threat to city's water",
        "original_text": "A river of toxic water was coursing towards one of China's biggest cities last night, threatening to contaminate local pipes and forcing millions of residents to prepare frantically for four days without water supplies. The government admitted that water supplies in Harbin, in north-eastern China, could be compromised by a chemical spill that released more than 100 times the safe level of benzene into a major river 10 days ago. Toxic fears spread hundreds of miles along the Songhua river from Heilongjiang province across the Russian border, but the panic was most intense in Harbin itself, where local media said crowds were fleeing the city through the railway station and airport. The mains were temporarily reopened during the morning so local people could fill bath tubs and buckets with water to see them through the next few days. But from this morning - when the pollution hits the city - 3.8m residents in the centre of Harbin will be unable to turn on a tap or flush a toilet. There have been no reports of illnesses, but hospitals have been ordered to prepare for possible contamination victims and hundreds of schools have been closed due to fears about sanitation. To minimise the risk of dehydration, municipal officials are using tankers to provide 16,000 tonnes of drinking water and have ordered the reopening of 368 old wells. While the true extent of the risk to human health remains unclear, the public's sense of unease has been heightened by mixed signals coming from the authorities, who have taken more than a week to raise the alarm. The toxins were released into the Songhua river on November 13 by an explosion at a chemical plant hundreds of miles upstream in Jilin province. Five people died in the blast at the factory, which is owned by the China National Petroleum Company - one of the biggest corporations in the country. The state environmental protection agency said it had started monitoring water safety levels within three hours of the explosion at the plant, yet its report - that 108 times the safe level of benzene seeped into the river - only became public knowledge yesterday. The pollution belt now stretches for more than 50 miles. Although the toxins have been diluted by tributaries, the most recent survey showed benzene and other toxins were still at 30 times normal levels. With the river moving slowly, at only 5mph, the toxic waste is expected to hit Harbin at 5am this morning and stay for several days until it is flushed away over the weekend. The contaminated waters could reach the Russian border and the connected Amur river early next week, though they will be increasingly diluted by then. Russian officials said they were taking no chances, but added that the threat was insignificant. \"The distance from here to Harbin is too big,\" said Alexander Burgas, of the emergency ministry in the city of Khabarovsk, 620 miles to the east. But in China, questions about the environmental disaster are spreading beyond Harbin. According to the Xinhua news agency, the provincial government is so concerned that it has warned city residents to stay away from the river to avoid possible exposure to airborne toxins. Upstream, there have been reports that many fish have died and, contrary to earlier denials, it appears that at least two cities, Songhua and Jilin, have shut down water supplies because of health fears. But the Chinese authorities have been reluctant to acknowledge what happened. Until yesterday, the official explanation for the prolonged water cut was \"maintenance work\". Officials said reports of contamination were \"just rumours\". Even though Harbin authorities now admit pollution is the main fear, the neighbouring province of Jilin still refuses to acknowledge the explosion caused dangerous levels of contamination in the river. It would not be the first time that local authorities in China attempted to cover up an economically damaging pollution scandal. In recent years, local media have exposed several \"cancer villages\" and \"black rivers\" caused by toxic outflows from poorly regulated chemical factories. The environment agency estimates that 70% of China's main rivers and lakes are so polluted that their water is undrinkable. Conservation groups believe the contamination and overexploitation of water supplies pose a major threat to the growth and environmental wellbeing of China. \"Factory owners must be more responsible and the authorities must release information about pollution more quickly to those likely to be affected,\" said Li Feng of the World Wildlife Fund. In Harbin, locals faced a choice - fill up or flee. At the local airport, travel agents have reported a sharp increase in passengers leaving the city. \"We are running out of tickets,\" said Wang Hongwei, at the D800 agency. \"There are three times more people than usual coming to buy tickets ... many people are leaving.\" Those who cannot afford to leave are ready to dig in. \"We have filled our bath and buckets with enough water for 10 days so I am not worried,\" said a local taxi driver who did not give his name. \"But it is an inconvenience. How can we do without water? It is more essential than food.\"",
        "debiased_text": "A chemical spill in northeastern China has led to concerns about water supply contamination in Harbin, a city with 3.8 million residents. On November 13, an explosion at a chemical plant in Jilin province released benzene into the Songhua River at levels reported to be 108 times the safety standard. Authorities stated that water monitoring began within three hours of the incident, but public notification occurred more than a week later. The pollution has created a 50-mile contamination zone along the river, with benzene levels currently measuring 30 times above normal. Authorities anticipate the contaminated water will reach Harbin, leading to a temporary suspension of water services starting in the morning. Municipal measures include distributing 16,000 tonnes of drinking water via tankers and reopening 368 wells. No illnesses have been reported, but hospitals have been instructed to prepare for potential cases, and hundreds of schools have closed as a precaution. The spill has also raised concerns in neighboring Russia, though officials there indicate the threat appears minimal. Upstream reports indicate fish deaths and water supply disruptions in at least two cities, though provincial authorities initially attributed Harbin’s water shutdown to maintenance work. The broader impact of industrial pollution on China’s water systems has been noted by environmental groups, with reports suggesting many rivers and lakes face significant contamination. In Harbin, some residents have prepared by storing water, while others have left the city, contributing to increased demand for travel tickets."

        "original_text": "Hong Kong -- MANY OF CHINA'S stock investors live in fear the government will cook up new ways of selling its huge holdings in listed companies. So it came as a surprise last week when shares in some publicly traded Chinese businesses bounced higher on hints the state is planning another stab at a big sell-down. Beijing twice before has tried to unload state shares, which can't be traded publicly, and it made a mess of it each time. The last attempt, in 2001, was abandoned after the market plunged 30% and spawned a threat of social unrest. Two-thirds of China's stock-market capitalization is locked up in state shares, leaving only $150 billion to be freely traded -- although much of that is in institutional portfolios and doesn't change hands. The fear is that any selloff would flood the market and make prices tumble. However, Beijing needs the money from share sales to fund social-welfare programs, and regulators recognize they must resolve the problem of state shares if China's ailing stock market is to turn around. Some investors and analysts hope Beijing has learned from the mistakes of its two aborted attempts. If that's so, fund managers say, a third effort to dispose of state shares could present an opportunity. Foreign investors can now access China's yuan-denominated Class A share markets through a special system that gets around Beijing's strict capital controls. Under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor, or QFII, program, Beijing has issued quotas to foreign institutions to buy shares valued at some $3.8 billion. Ke Shifeng, who looks after $300 million of Class A shares for U.K.- based fund manager Martin Currie, says he achieved a 3.2% return last year, despite a 15% fall in the main Chinese market index. He says there is real value to be found among Class A shares bought through the QFIIs, and he is bullish on moves to sell state shares. \"QFII investors will benefit,\" Mr. Ke says. The official Xinhua news agency created a stir last Tuesday by quoting a stock-market regulator as saying the overhang of state shares \"possesses the conditions to kick off trial reforms.\" A few days later, Premier Wen Jiabao sounded contrite and sympathetic to investors in remarks bemoaning the collapse of China's stock markets, now nudging six-year lows. Mr. Wen blamed \"our lack of know-how and experience\" and \"inadequate stock-market regulations.\" The premier said nothing about sales of state shares, but Friday the minister in charge of managing China's state-owned industrial assets, Li Rongrong, threw his support behind a trial sale of such shares. Still, investors hoping Beijing will quickly end the uncertainty surrounding state shares may be disappointed. Chinese officials don't agree on what role the state should play in industry. Some believe the state should get out of listed companies altogether or just keep small minority stakes. For now, there is little prospect the government will relinquish control of companies with monopolies in \"strategic\" industries such as energy and the media. Stephen Green, a Shanghai-based economist with Standard Chartered Bank, says China doesn't want to follow Russia and see large concentrations of state assets fall into the hands of a few private businessmen. Nor will it be easy for Beijing to take control of state companies away from bureaucrats. Analysts say the ideal scenario would be for the government to pick well-run companies to launch the trial. Attractively priced state shares would be willingly picked up by investors, including foreigners, in a market desperately short of quality stock. The government has given no details on how any sales will be managed or which companies will be selected. But a list of 50 stocks thought to be targets for trial sales is circulating among investors. Companies on it include steel titan Baoshan Iron & Steel, leading car maker Shanghai Automotive and China Minsheng Banking. --- Friday's Market Activity Japanese stocks took a tumble, completing a negative week. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 1.23%, or 2.57, to 205.71. Excluding the U.S., the index fell 0.83%, or 1.41, to 169.37. In TOKYO, the Nikkei Stock Average fell 1.7%, or 192.48 points, to 11370.69, matching the record set March 29 for the biggest one-day point fall so far this year.

        "debiased_text": "Hong Kong -- China's stock market experienced fluctuations following indications of potential state share sales. Historically, the Chinese government has made two attempts to sell state shares, which are not publicly tradable, but both attempts were discontinued due to market declines, including a 30% drop in 2001. Approximately two-thirds of China's stock-market capitalization consists of state shares, with around $150 billion available for free trading, though much is held in institutional portfolios. The government aims to use proceeds from share sales to fund social-welfare programs and improve the stock market's performance. Some investors and analysts speculate that lessons may have been learned from past attempts, potentially making a third effort more successful. Foreign investors can access China's Class A share markets through the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) program, which has allocated quotas totaling approximately $3.8 billion. Fund manager Ke Shifeng reported a 3.2% return in 2023 despite a 15% decline in the main market index, expressing optimism about state share sales benefiting QFII investors. Recent remarks from a stock-market regulator cited by Xinhua News Agency suggested trial reforms for state shares may be possible, though no concrete plans were announced. Premier Wen Jiabao acknowledged stock market challenges but did not address state share sales directly. Separately, Li Rongrong, responsible for managing state-owned industrial assets, endorsed trial sales of state shares. Disagreements among Chinese officials persist regarding the state's role in industry, with some advocating for reduced state ownership except in strategic sectors such as energy and media. Standard Chartered economist Stephen Green noted China’s reluctance to consolidate state assets among private entities, similar to Russia. Analysts suggest selecting well-managed companies for trial sales could attract investors. No official details have been provided regarding potential sales or participating companies, though a list of 50 possible candidates, including Baoshan Iron & Steel, Shanghai Automotive, and China Minsheng Banking, is circulating.

        "original_text": "A bilateral agreement between Pakistan and China, signed on Tuesday in Islamabad, proved both countries are \"among the key players who are playing a major role in the emerging world order\", according to Taimur-ul- Hassan in the Statesman. \"Even though friendship and cooperation between Pakistan and China ... is decades old, the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Good Neighbourly Relations takes their relationship to a higher stage,\" said Dawn, which highlighted China's \"clear and unambiguous\" assurances to defend Pakistan's \"sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity\". The treaty was a triumph for the government of President Pervez Musharraf, said the Islamabad Daily Mail: \"We should be proud of the fast-expanding co-operation with China ... which, in the words of Gen Musharraf, is deeper than oceans and higher than mountains.\" The Nation noted the different attitudes to Pakistan of China and the US. \"The US has generally relied on Pakistan to do its bidding every now and then to meet its strategic objectives in the region, while cultivating India for the long term, in return for which Pakistan has been given little more than economic pats on the back,\" it said. China, on the other hand, \"has engaged Pakistan more positively\". Thus Gen Musharraf \"is justified in laying emphasis on taking ties with China to new highs\".

Media outlets noted differences in the approaches of China and the U.S. toward Pakistan, with some highlighting China's positive engagement. Chinese state media characterized the relationship as an 'all-weather strategic partnership' and cited Premier Wen's visit as a step to further strengthen ties."

        "original_text": "Alaska's 2005 morel season actually started in the summer of 2004, when the state experienced its largest recorded wildfires. More than 6.7 million acres burned, much of it around the towns of Fairbanks and Tok in Central Alaska. Fairbanks locals wore dust masks for weeks, and a resident of Chicken, 60 miles from Tok and on the fire line, expressed the opinion that \"there are two seasons in Alaska, winter and smoke.\" What was a trial for humans and wildlife was a treat for mycelia, the underground fungal webs that produce mushrooms. In a process known as mycorrhiza, mycelia form a symbiotic relationship with the roots of trees and other plants, the fungi receiving sugars and amino acids they need to grow, the roots receiving water and minerals. But morels are clever, as one theory has it, and instead of dying when trees do - in a fire or by insect infestation or other major disturbance - they tap into a rush of nutrients from the decomposing roots and thrive. Of course, dependent as it is upon acts of God or accidents of nature, the mushroom trade carries risks for traders. However, colloquially known as \"cash in the woods\", it also carries great appeal in equal measure. In 2004, Alpine Foragers' Exchange, a Portland-based purveyor of wild and exotic mushrooms, purchased more than 200,000lbs of chanterelles for as little as $1.50 (86p) a pound and sold them for as much as $6.50 (£3.75) a pound. But it can just as easily be ruinous: this year's morel harvest in Oregon was one of the worst on record. Most species that grow on the US west coast, though, are reliable: every spring there will be morels from Northern California to British Columbia; chanterelles flourish in the Pacific Northwest's coastal regions in late summer; and come autumn in central Oregon there's the matsutake, a mushroom so highly prized by the Japanese that it has sold for $1,200 (£690) pound. But Alaska is the great unknown on the international mushroom circuit, having produced them on a commercial scale only once, after fires in 1990 resulted in what are often recalled as \"carpets of morels\" near Fairbanks and Tok. If this ever happened before, no one had paid much attention, but by the spring of 1991 wild mushrooms had become a culinary essential, and a few prescient buyers made their way to the state. They were amply rewarded - that year, the 98,000-acre Tok River fire yielded a morel harvest of 300,000lbs. By comparison, this year's burn area is almost 70 times larger. \"This is huge, this is vast,\" says Casey Jonquil as he spreads a US Department of Agriculture Forest Service map showing the extent of the fires over the counter of his kitchen in Portland, Oregon. \"The wilderness and the distance and the inaccessibility is very daunting, but the good news is, there are roads going right through it.\" His fingers trace byways near Fairbanks and Tok. \"The ground is proven, Tok especially. Tok had a fire 15 years ago, and 14 years ago they kicked ass. This is the same damn ground.\" Jonquil, who's been in the wild mushroom business for 16 years and owns Alpine Foragers' Exchange, started planning his Tok operation in December. \"The guy that gets the prime, killer spot can make a big difference in how the buy goes,\" he explains, adding that he's just returned from a week in Alaska, \"shaking hands and writing cheques\". The day before, he sent a barge carrying 3,000lbs of supplies to Tok, including hundreds of 5kg plastic mesh picking baskets, the sort of thing that might cost 99 cents at a cornershop but is impossible to secure in quantity in Alaska, and several of what he calls \"blue Chinese dryers\", large upright boxes in which fans continuously blow warm air across racks of fresh mushrooms, drying them and thus extending their shelf life from days to years. He's also hoping to ship them fresh, so he's lined up a refrigerated van to keep the product cool. Fresh morels are more profitable but harder to handle, because they tend to mold and melt. \"Morels are like little nuclear materials,\" says Jonquil. \"You get a bunch of them together without refrigeration ... they get this exothermic thing going. I mean, you stick your hand in there and it's hot.\" Jonquil's best-case scenario is that he pays no more than $2 (£1.15) a pound, that he buys and dries 4,000-6,000lbs a day, and that at the end of an estimated two-month season he sells $250,000 (£144,000) worth. \"Worst case is it rains cats and dogs, and the mushrooms will come in wet and heavy and dirty.\" Unpredictable weather and the perils that attend a cash business, and still, Jonquil lives well. \"Mushrooms have been very, very good to me,\" he says. Jay Southard, a buyer for Alpine Foragers' Exchange, is wearing a dusty Carhartt vest and ignoring a cup of coffee at a cafe in a shopping plaza outside Portland. It's late April, a week before he leaves for Tok, and he's just back from Washington state, where he tried to persuade some pickers he's worked with to make a 2,000-mile detour. Professional mushroom pickers in the US, known as circuit pickers, are on no one's payroll or schedule. Predominantly Mexican, Laotian and Cambodian, they sell for cash what they pick each day. Many do not maintain permanent residences, but follow the seasonal mushroom trail. \"I suggested that they carpool because of the price of gas,\" Southard says. \"What scares me about this trip is getting my hardcore pickers up there.\" He's been buying mushrooms for Jonquil and others for nearly 20 years, and knows a lot of pickers. He also knows what he doesn't want to see happen in Tok: \"local yokels\" manhandling the product. \"Every time you go into a new community like this, ma and pa go out there and they do it wrong,\" he says. \"They pull 'em, they pack 'em in bags, they put 'em in their trunk when it's 80 degrees out and they melt down ... It's always the local guy, he knows what he's doing, he's been tipping a few back and there's always an argument. [His mushrooms] are crawling with maggots, they're covered in dirt. 'They're fine,' he says. 'Yeah? Well then, you eat them' ... It's always that same guy. It's the same guy in every town.\" The transient nature of the wild mushroom business ensures that the animosity flows both directions. Pickers pull into town, set up camps or park their camper vans, leave rubbish in the woods and fire guns - if not at each other, then to signal their location, as they often spread out for miles. Then there's the money. The wild mushroom trade is frequently cited as the largest legal cash transaction in the US. Southard often carries $100,000 (£57,500) or more in cash, which is why he is licensed to carry a firearm, and does. \"If we did this job in the city,\" Southard says, \"somebody'd gun us down in a heartbeat.\" Jonquil is hoping to do good business this season in fresh morels, which should get to market within 48 hours of being picked. This means they must be driven to Anchorage, where there are direct flights to Portland. But before any of this happens, there has to be enough product to make this rush profitable. So far, there isn't, so Alpine is drying almost all the morels instead. He hopes to get $65 to $75 (£37-£43) a pound for dried, but the final price also depends on global markets. \"It's a real moving target,\" says Jonquil. \"We have to see what happens in China and India and Pakistan and Turkey - though we know Turkey did not have a good season. China just keeps getting better and better at what they do every year, and in India and Pakistan they dry the morels over dung fires - which I like, they taste great, kind of with a bacony flavor - but Europe doesn't want them smoked like that any more.\" Back in Portland, the dried morels will be sorted, conicas and grays and jumbos, and two additional grades that go to Europe, \"extras\", which have stems, and \"specials\", which are stemless and bring a higher price. \"Of course, the pickers pick them with stems, because they weigh more,\" Jonquil explains. Other weight-gain methods include a \"river-dip\" and stuffing each morel with a pebble. Buyers, too, have their tricks, from the egregious - a sponge placed beneath the scale so it weighs light - to the plebeian, such as wide-screen TVs, loud music and women in low-cut tops at the buying stations to distract the pickers. \"This is the dark side of this business,\" says Jonquil. \"It's the Wild West in the woods.\" © Nancy Rommelmann",
        "debiased_text": "In 2004, Alaska experienced its largest recorded wildfires, with over 6.7 million acres burned, primarily near Fairbanks and Tok. Smoke from the fires affected air quality in the region, including in Fairbanks, where residents used dust masks for weeks. One resident of Chicken, located 60 miles from Tok, noted that in Alaska, 'there are two seasons, winter and smoke.' Wildfires can create conditions favorable for morel mushrooms, which may thrive by accessing nutrients from decomposing roots after trees die. The mushroom trade involves financial risks but also potential profits. In 2004, Alpine Foragers' Exchange, a Portland-based mushroom supplier, purchased over 200,000 pounds of chanterelles at low prices and sold them at higher rates. However, yields can vary significantly, as seen in Oregon’s poor morel harvest this year. Mushroom production on the U.S. West Coast is generally consistent, with morels appearing in Northern California and British Columbia each spring, chanterelles in the Pacific Northwest in late summer, and matsutake mushrooms in central Oregon in autumn. Matsutake mushrooms are highly valued in Japan, with historical sales reaching $1,200 per pound. Alaska’s role in the mushroom market is less predictable. The state saw significant morel production only once before, after fires in 1990 resulted in large quantities near Fairbanks and Tok. By 1991, wild mushrooms had gained culinary popularity, leading buyers to Alaska, where the Tok River fire yielded 300,000 pounds of morels. This year’s burn area is nearly 70 times larger than the 1990 fires. Casey Jonquil, owner of Alpine Foragers' Exchange, examined U.S. Forest Service maps of the burned areas and noted roads near Fairbanks and Tok could provide access. Jonquil, who has 16 years of experience in the wild mushroom business, began planning a Tok operation in December, emphasizing the importance of securing optimal picking locations. He recently shipped supplies, including picking baskets and drying equipment, to Tok. His goal is to purchase and dry 4,000-6,000 pounds of morels daily, targeting $250,000 in sales over a two-month season. Challenges include weather conditions and handling fresh morels, which require refrigeration to prevent spoilage. Jay Southard, a buyer for Alpine Foragers' Exchange, is preparing to travel to Tok and has been recruiting pickers, many of whom follow seasonal mushroom harvests. He expressed concerns about inexperienced pickers mishandling mushrooms. The mushroom trade is largely cash-based, leading some buyers, including Southard, to carry significant amounts of money. Jonquil hopes to sell fresh morels, which require quick transport to Anchorage for flights to Portland, but current yields are insufficient, so most morels are being dried. Prices for dried morels vary based on global markets, including demand from China, India, Pakistan, and Turkey. In Portland, dried morels are sorted by type and quality, with stemless varieties fetching higher prices. The industry has faced issues with pickers and buyers using methods to artificially increase weight or manipulate transactions. Jonquil described these practices as 'the dark side of the business.'"

Hengyang county police arrested seven officials from the Hengyang County Social Welfare Institute on Monday [21 November] and confiscated a vehicle from the premises. The suspects included the institute's director, accountant and driver, the Beijing News reported. Twenty others involved with social welfare institutes in the county were brought in for questioning. The arrests came a day after police arrested a local kidnapper who allegedly sold babies to the social welfare institute for 800 to 1,200 yuan each. The institute allegedly used the new babies to justify requests for more government funding. It is then said to have sold the children to other orphanages and individuals for 8,000 to 30,000 yuan. The paper reported the institute was operating the \"business\" for a few years and that the babies were sold to Changsha, Guangxi, Guangzhou, Chenzhou and Zhuzhou. One of the institute's regular customers was a social welfare institute in Changsha that allegedly paid 60,000 yuan for five babies and gave two vehicles as gifts. An officer from the Qidong county police bureau yesterday said the suspects were still being interrogated at the station. She declined to comment on the number of babies involved. An official at the social welfare institute said a new director had been appointed after the former bosses \"got into trouble\". He said the institute's services were focused on the elderly. He added that it sometimes transferred babies to other centres with better care, but that babies were never sold. Dong Yingzhong, director of the Changsha No 2 Social Welfare Institute, said he was not aware of the arrests and that the centres could not offer adoption services to the public under normal circumstances. \"I'm sure it's just an individual case.\"",

        "title": "TUTORING FILLS GROWING NICHE ; NOW A BIG BUSINESS, OCCUPATION OFFERS FLEXIBILITY AS CAREER OR SUPPLEMENTAL JOB: [THIRD EDITION]",
        "original_text": "Tutor, a Latin word, is one of those slightly stuffy sounding occupations calling to mind the Jane Austen character Henry Tilney from the novel, \"Northanger Abbey.\" But today, tutoring is anything but stuffy in fact, it is a big business and, for many professionals, a great supplementary job or even a career in its own right.\nKaplan Inc., for instance, which provides tutors that focus on improving students' SAT scores as well as a wide range of other subjects, has seen revenue grow from $89 million a decade ago to $1.35 billion today.\nFor individuals, this means a lot of opportunity. For instance, Jessica Walton, who runs a program in urban design at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design, says tutoring has proven to be the perfect adjunct to her day job.\n\"I have always had to work my way through school,\" with positions that involved helping students write better or teaching adults with literacy problems, the Swarthmore graduate said. Now she is employed as a part-time one-to-one tutor by Summit Educational Group Inc. \"I started looking at Summit when my son was born, and I realized I wanted to transition from what I do to actively teaching,\" she explained. However, having just moved into a new house, it was also important for her to make as much money as possible, she said.\nWalton said she teaches students across a range of ages and abilities. \"I have some students that are still struggling to understand the difference between a noun and a verb and others who are already scoring 720 or 730 on the exam and want to do better,\" she said. More to the point, though, Walton says the pay is great, and if she chose to work full time for Summit at her current $26 per hour, it would add up to about the same as her earnings at Harvard.\nAnd tutoring, it turns out, fits perfectly. \"I'm exhausted at the end of the day, but when I'm heading off to sleep I remember all over why I'm doing this,\" she said.\nTutoring as a part time and supplemental activity is also just right for Bob Christie, who is an independent sales agent for AFLAC Insurance most of the time but spends his unscheduled time tutoring for Summit. \"I have very flexible hours with AFLAC, and it's the same thing with Summit,\" Christie said.\nHowever, for Louis Zirin, a retired MIT engineer who spent much of his career at General Electric, the attraction of responding to the Summit ad was not so much the opportunity to supplement his income as it was remaining active. \"I'm not one to play tennis and golf all the time, and I have always been interested in teaching, even when I was at GE, so I thought it would be fun to help students trying to get into prep schools or college,\" he said.\nZirin says he typically sees between six and eight students a week, always one-on-one and always at their homes. In fact, Zirin says that brings to mind the only big downside of the job: driving. Zirin says while 80 percent of his students are located either in his own town, Swampscott, or in nearby Marblehead, he sometimes travels as far as Beverly or even Andover. Zirin tutors in preparation for the SAT, the SSAT (an admission test for private prep schools), and also the ACT college admission test. He says because of the test schedules, he is busy most of the year, except the late spring and early summer.\nBesides providing testing help, Zirin says he works with some students on more specific issues, including physics, chemistry, and math.\nOf course, tutoring does become more or less of a full-time job for some people. Julia Colton, for example, left behind her position as a Bearing Point consultant \"for personal and family reasons\" and now works 30 or more hours a week tutoring for Summit. Like Zirin, she finds the driving required to get to students frustrating but agrees the satisfaction derived from working one-to-one makes up for that.\nThen there's Aimee Demora, employed full time as a center director for a one of the 167 K-10-focused Kaplan Score centers based in Winchester. Since 1992, Score centers have provided help in math, reading, writing and other areas to more than 250,000 students of all learning levels. Demora said Kaplan recruited her out of college, where she majored in political science and minored in Spanish. She says it helped that she has spent some of her time as an undergrad tutoring fellow students and then teaching English to local children during a semester at the University of Seville in Spain.\nSince she joined Kaplan, she has continued to tutor but has also taken on management responsibilities scheduling and supervising a staff of full-time and part-time employees. But for Kaplan, the focus remains on tutoring. \"It is the best of both worlds, I get to work with kids from age 4 to 14, and I do everything from remediation of basic skills to working with advanced kids coming in for additional challenges,\" Demora said.\nOf course, tutoring is by no means only the domain of name brand businesses it's also a cottage industry. Emma Lee, originally from Taiwan, started teaching Mandarin Chinese in the adult education program for the town of Franklin when her daughter was nine months old. \"I was supposed to get an accounting job because I took accounting courses a few years ago and was doing quite well, however, I had a 7-year-old son and a little girl to take care of and I just needed a manageable night job,\" that wouldn't take too much time, she said. Because she had majored in both Chinese and in teaching English as a second language, she realized she might be qualified to teach Chinese, too. She ended up teaching a local adult ed class and then began to teach students individually.\nLee has now decided to continue to focus on teaching Chinese and has even written a textbook to teach both Chinese culture and language. The inspiration, however, came from the students she tutored.\n\"People always think Chinese is very hard to learn, but working with my students, I have found if someone is determined and takes the right approach it's as easy as ABC,\" says Lee.",
        "debiased_text": "Tutoring has become a significant industry and a supplementary or primary career for many professionals.

She teaches students of varying ages and skill levels. Walton stated that tutoring provides competitive pay, with her current rate at $26 per hour. \n\nBob Christie, an independent sales agent for AFLAC Insurance, tutors during his flexible hours for Summit. Louis Zirin, a retired MIT engineer, tutors students in preparation for standardized tests such as the SAT, SSAT, and ACT. He works with six to eight students weekly, primarily in their homes. Zirin noted that commuting is a drawback of the job. \n\nJulia Colton, a former Bearing Point consultant, now tutors for Summit 30 or more hours per week.

        "title": "Nobel scientist warns on bird flu",
        "original_text": "Avian flu - caught directly from birds, and which kills in seven cases out of 10 - could suddenly sweep through the human population, killing 70 million people according to World Health Organisation estimates, a Nobel laureate warned yesterday. Peter Doherty, of the University of Melbourne, who shared the 1996 Nobel prize for medicine, was speaking at an assembly of laureates in Lyon, France, 50 years to the day after the first announcement of an effective vaccine against the crippling disease poliomyelitis. World health teams hope to eliminate polio altogether by the end of 2005. But, Prof Doherty warned the Biovision conference, there were more immediate hazards. Avian flu has killed people who worked with poultry in south-east Asia. Prof Doherty warned that a simultaneous epidemic of human and bird flu could prove a lethal mix, opening the way for the two viruses to mutate into a dangerous infection that could spread swiftly through the human population. \"If it comes, it will probably come out of somewhere like south-east Asia and it will probably come very fast,\" he said. \"It is highly lethal in birds, and in humans, when they catch it, it is something like 70% lethal. So it is very dangerous.\" Influenza is a very simple virus with a genetic code in eight segments that can only replicate in an infected host. If a human infected with flu from ducks was also infected with human flu, then the two viruses could reassort themselves: swap genes. It happened 30 years ago, with Hong Kong flu, which also began in ducks, he said. In countries like Cambodia and Vietnam, where influenza vaccines were rare, a human version of avian flu would spread rapidly. Governments had begun to stockpile an antiviral called Tamiflu, which was effective if taken early enough. \"But if we got a real outbreak ... with massive numbers of cases there would probably be enough Tamiflu to protect key medical professionals, perhaps politicians ... it is whether there is enough of it around,\" he said. Scientists in Britain, China and the US were racing to devise new vaccines. Researchers at the National Institute for Biological Standards in London are using a new technique called reverse genetics, to detach proteins from the surface of a standard strand of flu vaccine, and replace it with proteins from avian flu. This would mean that vaccines could be \"grown\" very swiftly. \"The interesting thing is that it would be, as a vaccine, a genuinely genetically modified organism, a GMO. Will the Europeans take a GMO when it is injected in their arms and saving their lives from flu? We shall see,\" Prof Doherty said. Three years ago, severe acute respiratory syndrome - Sars - had been dangerous but slow to infect, he said. But influenza moved swiftly. In the world's most catastrophic pandemic, the Spanish influenza outbreak of 1918, the global death toll was estimated at more than 40 million. People travelled slowly then - by sea - but the virus still reached almost the entire world. Now people moved from one continent to another in a day, the global population had trebled, and people were more likely to defy attempts to impose quarantine. \"We may duck the bullet. We may be lucky. But I think it is a reasonably high probability, because you have a lot of human flu,\" Prof Doherty said. \"We will always have flu epidemics. Once the thing hits, we would deal with it extraordinarily well.\"",
        "debiased_text": "A Nobel laureate has discussed the potential risks of avian influenza to human populations based on World Health Organization estimates. Peter Doherty, a professor at the University of Melbourne and recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Medicine, spoke at a laureate assembly in Lyon, France. The event coincided with the 50th anniversary of the announcement of the first effective polio vaccine. Health organizations aim to eradicate polio by the end of 2005, but Professor Doherty highlighted more immediate concerns regarding avian flu.\\n\\nAvian influenza has resulted in fatalities among poultry workers in Southeast Asia. Professor Doherty noted that simultaneous human and avian flu outbreaks could create conditions for viral mutation, potentially leading to a new strain capable of rapid human transmission. 'If it occurs, it would likely originate in regions such as Southeast Asia and spread quickly,' he stated. The virus has shown high mortality rates in both birds and humans.\\n\\nInfluenza viruses have an eight-segment genetic code and require a host to replicate. Professor Doherty explained that if a human contracted both avian and human flu simultaneously, genetic reassortment could occur. Similar events happened 30 years ago with the Hong Kong flu strain, which originated in ducks.\\n\\nCountries with limited access to influenza vaccines, such as Cambodia and Vietnam, could experience rapid spread of an avian-derived human flu strain. Some governments have begun stockpiling the antiviral drug Tamiflu, which is effective when administered early. However, Professor Doherty questioned whether supplies would be sufficient during a large-scale outbreak to protect medical professionals and key personnel.\\n\\nResearch teams in Britain, China, and the United States are developing new vaccines. Scientists at the National Institute for Biological Standards in London are employing reverse genetics techniques to modify flu vaccine strains by incorporating avian flu proteins. This approach could accelerate vaccine production. Professor Doherty noted this would create a genetically modified vaccine, raising questions about public acceptance in certain regions.\\n\\nComparing historical outbreaks, Professor Doherty referenced the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that caused an estimated 40 million deaths worldwide. While that virus spread primarily by sea travel, modern air travel enables faster global transmission. Population growth and reduced quarantine compliance could further complicate containment efforts.\\n\\n'While we may avoid such an outbreak through chance, the probability remains significant due to widespread human influenza,' Professor Doherty concluded. 'Flu epidemics will continue to occur, but we would likely respond effectively once an outbreak begins.'"

English teacher Clare Wei stuck to tea and salad. Clerk Chris Li was more timid and chugged just a Coke. \"It's risky to eat chicken right now,\" Ms. Li said. \"I haven't ordered food in KFC for days in case they have touched the chicken.\" Similar sentiments are spreading throughout China, where many diners are boycotting chicken in a panic over bird flu among poultry; yesterday, officials reported the sixth such outbreak in a month. Sales of chicken, duck meat and eggs throughout the country have plunged by as much as 60% in recent weeks, according to poultry farmers and suppliers. Yum Brands Inc., like McDonald's Corp. and other American fast-food chains, views China as one of the last regions on the planet where the fast-food business has room to grow rapidly. But on Monday Yum said October sales at its 1,500 KFC restaurants in China rose just 8% -- well below its long-term 22% target. Yum, which also operates Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, said it's too soon to know if bird flu is a factor in slowing sales growth, and instead blames them partly on an unpopular new fried chicken steak item. \"It didn't resonate with consumers,\" said Jonathan Blum, senior vice president for Yum, which is based in Louisville, Ky. Chinese residents have been treated to unappetizing pictures of mass incinerations of diseased chickens on their TV screens. Live-poultry markets have been closed in the capital city Beijing. World Health Organization officials say the disease is now proving almost impossible to control among China's massive poultry population -- with cases now cropping up on China's eastern seaboard, where more-affluent cities are located. Health officials are concerned that the virus could mutate into a form that passes to humans, possibly sparking a global outbreak. Chinese authorities have put 116 people under quarantine at the site of the recent outbreaks in Liaoning Province. Still, health experts say the panic is irrational. According to the WHO, it is safe to eat poultry even in areas with bird-flu outbreaks as long as it is cooked at temperatures above 150 degrees Fahrenheit. In other parts of the world, consumer anxiety about bird flu and eating poultry is mixed. In the United Kingdom, restaurants and supermarkets have seen little decline in demand for chicken and eggs. But some Southern European countries have been hit hard, partly because of the proximity to Greece, Romania and Croatia, where the disease has surfaced in bird flocks in recent weeks. Sales of chicken in Italy declined by about 50% in October, according to the country's poultry association. In the U.S., \"we've not detected any problems in demand for chicken because of the avian-influenza situation,\" said Richard Lobb, spokesman for the National Chicken Council, a Washington-based trade association for chicken suppliers. Yum is making contingency plans to deal with the bird flu issue. \"Like others, we are closely monitoring the avian flu situation around the globe,\" said David Novak, chairman and chief executive officer of Yum, in a statement. The company is preparing television ads that can be rolled out globally if a bird-flu epidemic emerges among humans. Mr. Blum said the ads simply state that eating cooked chicken is safe. \"They won't air, and I hope they never do,\" he said. KFC's China outlets now feature tray liners and posters assuring consumers that the chain's chicken comes from high-quality suppliers, and that all chicken is cooked at high temperatures. Mr. Blum said that the poultry the company buys in China and the U.S. is raised in shelters, protecting the flock from migratory birds that might carry avian flu. The scene is eerily similar to a couple of years ago, when bird flu was spreading across Asia. The situation was so serious in neighboring Vietnam that KFC restaurants substituted fish for chicken temporarily. Many poultry farmers are cutting back on chicken feed, said Cai Xiangmin, sales manager at feed company Hangzhou Huineng Bio- Technology Co., which reported a sales plunge of 10% to 15% last month. \"Most of the poultry farmers are in a wait-and-see attitude in terms of the bird-flu influence into the market, so they slow their pace for feeding, making chickens and ducks grow more slowly,\" Mr. Cai said. Any collapse in China's poultry industry would be bad news for the U.S. Farm Belt, since a lot of its feed is eaten by chickens in China. U.S. soybean prices already are down sharply due to the harvest of a larger-than-expected crop. So far, the U.S. grain industry hasn't seen any bird-flu-related slowdown in orders from China, which buys more than $2 billion of U.S. soybeans annually. \"We're not at that point yet,\" said Harry Baumes, an agricultural economist at Global Insight Inc., an economic forecasting concern in Eddystone, Pa. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said yesterday that it expects China to import 27.50 million metric tons of the world's soybeans in 2006, up 6.6% from this year. Even if China's demand for chicken feed were to soften significantly, a consumer shift to alternative meats such as pork might spur demand by China's hog industry for U.S. feed. China's economic growth also is fueling demand for soybeans for human food as well. KFC, which began operating in the country in 1987, has been frequently used as an example of success in China. KFC's first outlet was in a prime location near Tiananmen Square. Yum's growth in China was so rapid that the Shanghai-based subsidiary in 2004 posted more than $200 million in operating profit, surpassing the company's earnings last year from its entire U.S. KFC chain. Other fast-food companies are making plans in case consumers start shifting their tastes away from chicken. In an interview Wednesday, Matthew Paull, McDonald's chief financial officer, said \"we have seen no effect yet\" in sales because of bird flu, particularly in China. Nevertheless, the world's largest restaurant chain by sales has a team of executives at its Oak Brook, Ill., headquarters developing contingency plans. Mr. Paull offered few details about the plans. McDonald's has 5,700 restaurants across Asia, including about 700 in China. --- Zhou Yang, Deborah Ball,Scott Kilman and Candy Tang contributed to this article.",
        "debiased_text": "During lunch at a KFC restaurant in central Beijing this week, some customers avoided ordering chicken. English teacher Clare Wei had tea and salad, while clerk Chris Li chose only a Coke. 'I haven't ordered food at KFC for days in case they have touched the chicken,' Ms. Li said. Similar behavior has been observed in China amid reports of bird flu outbreaks in poultry. Officials reported the sixth outbreak within a month. According to poultry farmers and suppliers, sales of chicken, duck meat, and eggs nationwide have declined by up to 60% in recent weeks.\n\nYum Brands Inc., which operates KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, reported an 8% increase in October sales at its 1,500 KFC restaurants in China, below its long-term target of 22%. The company stated it is too early to determine if bird flu is affecting sales and attributed part of the slowdown to an unpopular new fried chicken steak item. 'It didn’t resonate with consumers,' said Jonathan Blum, a senior vice president at Yum.\n\nChinese television has shown images of mass incinerations of infected chickens, and live-poultry markets in Beijing have been closed. The World Health Organization has noted challenges in controlling the disease in China’s poultry population, with cases emerging in eastern coastal regions. Health officials are monitoring the risk of the virus mutating and spreading to humans. In Liaoning Province, 116 people have been quarantined near recent outbreak sites. Health experts say properly cooked poultry remains safe to consume.\n\nConsumer reactions vary globally. In the U.K., demand for chicken and eggs remains steady, while Italy reported a 50% decline in chicken sales in October, according to its poultry association. The U.S. has not seen a drop in demand, as stated by the National Chicken Council.\n\nYum is preparing contingency plans, including potential television ads promoting the safety of cooked chicken, though the company hopes they will not be needed. KFC China has introduced tray liners and posters assuring customers of its high-quality suppliers and high-temperature cooking standards.\n\nPoultry farmers are reducing chicken feed, with some suppliers reporting sales declines of 10-15%. Feed companies note that farmers are taking a cautious approach, slowing poultry growth rates. A significant downturn in China’s poultry industry could affect U.S. soybean exports, though no slowdown has been observed yet. The USDA projects a 6.6% increase in China’s soybean imports for 2026.\n\nKFC, operating in China since 1987, has been a notable success, with its Shanghai subsidiary surpassing U.S. earnings in 2004. Other fast-food chains, including McDonald’s, report no current sales impact from bird flu but are preparing contingency plans. McDonald’s has 5,700 restaurants in Asia, about 700 of which are in China.\n\nContributors to this report include Zhou Yang, Deborah Ball, Scott Kilman, and Candy Tang."

        "original_text": "The war of words between the US and North Korea, which has already broken every diplomatic nicety in the book, descended to new levels of insult yesterday when the Korean government called the US vice-president a \"bloodthirsty beast\". Responding to criticism from Dick Cheney - who had labelled North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, \"one of the world's more irresponsible leaders\" - a North Korean official hit back with some bald invective, saying the row would do little to revive the six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear weapons programmes. \"Cheney is hated as the most cruel monster and bloodthirsty beast, as he has drenched various parts of the world in blood,\" said the foreign ministry spokesman. The exchanges have escalated in recent weeks, with George Bush calling the Korean leader a tyrant. The Pyongyang government has shot back, calling the US president \"a half-baked man\" and \"a philistine\". Earlier in the week Mr Cheney told CNN that Mr Kim ran a police state. \"He's got one of the most heavily militarised societies in the world. He doesn't take care of his people at all. And he obviously wants to throw his weight around and become a nuclear power.\" The North Korean spokesman said Mr Cheney's words would discourage Pyongyang from returning to the nuclear talks it left almost a year ago. The US has joined China, Russia, Japan and South Korea in trying to bring North Korea into the fold through multi-party talks. But Pyongyang left the negotiations and declared it had nuclear weapons. In Washington, the White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said the comments from North Korea were \"more of the same kind of bluster we hear from [there] from time to time\", which served only to \"further isolate [them] from the international community\". He said: \"We all share the goal of a nuclear-free peninsula.\" Patience is wearing thin in Washington. US officials have said they might take the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN security council, which could impose sanctions if Pyongyang does not return to talks.",

        "original_text": "Efforts by Chinese regulators to create a more orderly market for new listings suffered a setback yesterday when shares in Huadian Power, an energy generator, surged 79 per cent on their first day of trading on the Shanghai bourse. Shares in the energy group, which raised Rmb1.93bn (Dollars 233m) with the first listing on the Shanghai exchange in five months, more than doubled from their IPO price of Rmb2.52 to Rmb5.35 in early trading, before falling back to Rmb4.51 by the close. The Huadian listing was the first to use a new, fairer system for pricing that was designed to prevent sharp rises in the price of shares on the first day of trade. Under the old IPO system, prices were often set artificially low in order to ensure a large jump on the opening day of trading, which would then be followed by a gradual sell-down to below the listing level. The result was that many retail investors applied for shares in the IPO and quickly sold the holdings in order to make short- term profits. With the Huadian IPO, the securities regulator introduced a more conventional book-building system, with local institutions setting a price for a portion of the shares on offer, and the remainder being offered using the institutional level as a guide. The objective was to create a stable, institutional shareholder base from the outset of the offering. Huadian, which is already listed on the Hong Kong market, is China's third-largest power generator and is based in Shandong, on the central eastern coast. Local analysts said one reason for the sharp jump in Huadian shares was the pent-up demand among retail investors for new offerings - following the five-month freeze in IPOs introduced by regulators last August while they developed the new pricing system. Several analysts said Huadian's share price was now likely to fall because of concerns over the company's performance this year. Huadian is particularly vulnerable to rising coal prices. The leap in Huadian shares contributed to an early 5 per cent increase in the Shanghai composite index, which also reflected renewed speculation about possible new measures to boost the domestic equity market. However the index later fell back, closing down 0.8 per cent. Huadian's Hong Kong-listed shares rose 2.1 per cent to HKDollars 2.40.",
        "debiased_text": "Chinese regulators introduced a new pricing system for initial public offerings (IPOs) aimed at creating a more orderly market. Yesterday, shares of Huadian Power, an energy generator, increased by 79% on their first day of trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

Huadian Power, China’s third-largest power generator and already listed in Hong Kong, is headquartered in Shandong. Analysts noted that demand for new offerings may have been influenced by the five-month IPO pause while regulators developed the new system. Some analysts suggested Huadian's share price could decline due to concerns over its performance and exposure to rising coal prices. Huadian's trading contributed to an early 5% rise in the Shanghai Composite Index, which later fell by 0.8% by the close. Huadian’s Hong Kong shares increased by 2.1% to HKD2.40."

Apologies for the confusion. Most people believe their government does not act according to their wishes, a worldwide opinion survey shows. Lack of confidence in governments is highest in the former Soviet bloc, where 75% say their country is not governed by the will of the people, but similar views are held by most Europeans (64%) and North Americans (60%). The findings come from one of the largest international polls ever undertaken. Commissioned by the BBC World Service, Gallup interviewed more than 50,000 people in 68 countries, representative of the views of 1.3 billion people worldwide. The main exclusions were China and most of the Middle East, where government restrictions make polling difficult or impossible. Overall, slightly less than half of those surveyed (47%) felt that elections in their country were free and fair. Confidence in elections was highest in Scandinavia (82%) and South Africa (76%), and lowest in West Africa (24%) and the former Soviet Union (25%). Worldwide, politicians represent the least trusted occupation in the survey, scoring only 13%. Religious leaders are the most trusted (33%), followed by military/police leaders (26%), journalists (26%) and business leaders (19%). Asked which types of people they would like to give more power to, 35% favoured \"intellectuals\" (writers and academics), followed by religious leaders on 25%. Behind the global figures there are wide variations between countries and regions. There is a low level of trust in all types of leaders throughout Europe. Almost a third of people expressed no trust in military, religious, business or political leaders or journalists. The media and journalists are particularly distrusted in Europe. Japanese people have very little trust in authority figures - only 1% have faith in military / police leaders and 3% trust religious leaders. Only 4% of Ukrainians and 8% of Russians said they trusted military or police leaders. Confidence in religious leaders varies widely. They are most trusted in Africa (74% against 33% globally), and in Nigeria 86% would give them more power. In the US 50% trust religious leaders and 40% would give them more power. Almost everywhere, people said family and friends were the most important influences on their personal decisions, but religious leaders were the most important influence for 13% in Africa and 12% in North America. Elsewhere, religious influence was small or negligible.",

        "title": "Fraser Newham in China, preparing to host Miss World for third year running",
        "original_text": "Two billion people are watching by live telecast, and American Miss World hopeful Nancy Randall is about to address the world in Chinese, a language notorious for its embarrassing pitfalls. \"I love you, Sanya!\" she says in Mandarin to the camera. \"I love you, China!\" The all-smiling anthropology graduate from Louisiana pulls it off. Around the auditorium, grey-suited party cadres break into applause, and the home crowd ripples with delight. If this is diplomacy, it's honey-coated - and when this Saturday the Chinese resort of Sanya once again plays host to this year's Miss World final, all involved will be hoping for plenty more of the same. Miss World is the largest live annual TV event on Earth, and this year's contest will be the biggest in its 55-year history. And with memories still fresh of the mass rioting in Nigeria in 2002, when the contest was forced at the last minute to move to London, Miss World may just have found a home in Sanya, the principal resort on Hainan - the subtropical island tourist chiefs like to call \"China's Hawaii\", and to which the contest is returning for the third successive year. The country's feminist groups may grumble, but there is little doubt that overall the Chinese are very happy hosts. The 115 contestants have been in China for weeks. The first stop on an ambitious month-long tour was the east-coast city of Wenzhou, an economic pace-setter but not a spot that tends to figure on tourist itineraries. With state media in hot pursuit, the girls visited a market, toured the local beauty spots and served as bridesmaids in a surreal televised mass wedding. The city's senior official, Mayor Xu, even stepped up to help judge the first of this year's fast-track qualifying rounds, the talent show. This represents a massive change in attitude, says Wang Zheng, an associate professor at the University of Michigan, who grew up in Shanghai. \"After the famine of the early 1960s, the official media began to promote a more frugal lifestyle,\" she says. \"Simplicity was seen as a virtue of the proletariat, and there was an emphasis on 'proletarian style' - army uniforms or peasants' and workers' outfits. Everything else was condemned as bourgeois.\" Wang Zheng recalls the onset of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. \"Groups of Red Guard students took to the streets to police women's clothing and hairstyles,\" she remembers. \"If they didn't like what a woman wore, they would cut up her clothes or shoes in public.\" Wang's elder sister was one such victim - a young teacher with naturally wavy hair. Her own pupils accused her of wearing a western-style perm, she was publicly criticised, and forced to hand over one of her favourite garments, a jean jacket with a sailor collar. Chances are, the Red Guards won't be much in evidence at the Sanya Sheraton on December 10. \"People here are very enthusiastic about Miss World, and beauty contests in general,\" says Steven Crane, managing editor of lifestyle magazine That's Shanghai. \"Most of these events sell out - and they receive wide coverage in the official Chinese media.\" While British coverage will be provided by the relatively obscure satellite channel Sky Travel, in China the event will go out live on state broadcaster CCTV, clearly with the support of party bosses. What's in it for them? Tourist dollars, for a start. Hainan may always have had the climate, but the island was once a corrupt, denuded outpost, far from the spoils of government in Beijing. It was a place of exile inhabited by wild aboriginal tribes such as the Li, whose women disfigured their faces with tattoos, supposedly to make themselves unattractive to their plundering neighbours. These days, Li women perform for tourists in the swanky international developments of Sanya town. For a regime keen to publicise its economic success and internationalist credentials at home and abroad, the month-long beauty-fest is propaganda gold dust. Miss World may not yet have her own float in the National Day parade in Tiananmen Square; but in a country where media content still falls under governmental control, the heavy coverage that the contest receives sends a powerful signal that the senior cadres feel the contest serves their ends. Domestic TV coverage has a clearly defined political function. In general, the Chinese media like to broadcast footage of resident westerners going about their daily lives. Inevitably the subject is shown praising China - and if, like last year's Miss USA Nancy Randall, they do so in endearingly elementary Chinese, all the better. This kind of material has a significance over and above the feelgood factor; it underlines the success of recent liberalising policies. Meanwhile on an international level the Miss World contest allows a carefully constructed Chinese message to be broadcast to an audience of two billion across the globe. Over the past 10 years the Chinese have worked hard to dispel once ubiquitous images of China, the bicycling factory state, and glamorous events like Miss World are a tonic. Not only that - the contest sends a strong message to the world about China's changing values and internationalisation, that the days of the Red Guards are over. \"This sort of programming helps build an international image that is unthreatening and somehow reassuring,\" says Crane. \"After all, beauty pageants were once considered as American as apple pie.\" China, it seems, is getting its money's worth from the relationship - and Miss World hardly has cause to complain. \"The Miss World Organisation receives two things: an exotic locale, and a public that doesn't yet view such contests as passe or sexist,\" says Crane. But does no one in China think this is all just a little odd? Organisations like the All-China Women's Federation, the largest women's organisation in China, have raised dissenting voices. Wang Zheng would like to hear a real debate. \"Miss World tells Chinese women that their appearance defines who they are. It tells them a woman's value hinges on the way she looks.\" But, at a time when state mouthpiece China Daily reports the establishment of the \"Chinese beauty standard\" (\"a Chinese beauty must have ... a distance of 35mm between the eyes\"), all the money points in the opposite direction. It's like a church leader denouncing the excesses of I'm a Celebrity; in other words, the old guard may get their platform - but in the end many young Chinese women seem more inclined to buy into the burgeoning world of beauty products and cosmetic surgery than listen to the old-sounding arguments of a once revolutionary generation.",
        "debiased_text": "Approximately two billion people are estimated to have watched the live broadcast of the Miss World pageant. American contestant Nancy Randall spoke in Mandarin during the event, stating, 'I love you, Sanya' and 'I love you, China.' The audience, including local attendees and officials, applauded the segment. The Miss World final is scheduled to take place in Sanya, China, marking the third consecutive year the event has been held in the city. Miss World is recognized as one of the largest annually televised events globally. The competition was relocated from Nigeria to London in 2002 due to unrest, but it has since found a consistent venue in Sanya. The 115 contestants have been touring China for several weeks, with their first stop in Wenzhou, where they participated in local activities and a televised group wedding. A local official assisted in judging a preliminary round of the competition. According to Wang Zheng, an associate professor at the University of Michigan, China's historical emphasis on frugality and proletarian aesthetics has shifted in recent decades. During the Cultural Revolution, certain clothing styles were discouraged, but such restrictions are no longer in place. The Miss World event is being broadcast live on China's state television network, CCTV. Steven Crane, managing editor of That's Shanghai, noted that beauty pageants are popular in China and receive significant media coverage. Hainan, where Sanya is located, has evolved economically and now hosts international events. The Chinese government's support for Miss World is seen by some as part of its broader international outreach. While organizations like the All-China Women's Federation have expressed concerns about the pageant's messaging, the event continues to attract interest. China Daily has reported on national beauty standards, reflecting ongoing discussions about appearance and value in Chinese society."

        "title": "Group to Pay $3.1 Billion for Bank of China Stake; Group to Pay $3.1 Billion for Bank of China Stake",
        "original_text": "HONG KONG -- Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC said it would lead a team including a unit of Merrill Lynch & Co. and Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing in investing $3.1 billion to buy 10% of Bank of China. Royal Bank of Scotland, the world's sixth-largest bank by market capitalization, said it will put in $1.6 billion itself. The sum appeared to relieve shareholders who have punished the stock in recent weeks on fears that the Edinburgh, Scotland, bank would make a much larger bet in the risky Chinese market. Bank of China, the country's top foreign-exchange bank, plans a stock-market listing valued at about $4 billion. It is likely to take place early next year. RBS, as the British bank is known, said it will end up with 5.16% of Bank of China, Merrill Lynch with 2.84% and Mr. Li with 2%, although RBS will control the entire investment and gain a seat on the board. Mr. Li's investment will be made through his private Li Ka-shing Foundation. The consortium agreed not to sell its stake for three years. The deal is the latest in a flurry by global investors eager to tap into China's $1.6 trillion in personal bank savings with products and services from credit cards to home insurance, ahead of the full opening of the Chinese banking industry to foreign players at the end of 2006. Investing in a big lender like Bank of China, which has 11,609 branches, gives foreign investors access to a mass market. The strategy isn't without risk. Bank of China took a government bailout of $22.5 billion in 2003 that allowed it to unload bad loans and become technically solvent. At the end of last year, 5.12% of its total loans were nonperforming, compared with 16.28% a year before. The bank's sprawling branch network, like those of China's other Big Four state-run commercial banks, is filled with hidden dangers because of weak oversight and corruption. In recent years, Bank of China has suffered a string of scandals involving rogue branch officials. A week ago, Chinese state media reported that a former head of Bank of China's listed Hong Kong unit was given a suspended death sentence for embezzlement. Such a sentence often is commuted to life imprisonment. In April, the bank disclosed a lending scandal that cost its Beijing branch about $78 million. A month earlier, one manager at a branch in Harbin fled the country after allegedly rifling as much as $120 million from customer accounts. Shares of RBS suffered as shareholders fretted that Chief Executive Fred Goodwin would risk too much of the bank's capital in a market in which it has little experience. RBS operates a small branch in Shanghai that deals exclusively with corporate customers. Media reports had suggested that the bank would pay $2.5 billion or more for a 10% stake. The British bank said its Bank of China investment would be funded by the sale of its stake in Spanish bank Banco Santander Central Hispano SA. RBS ruled out increasing its shareholding in the Chinese lender, China's second-largest bank in terms of assets. The bank's stock quickly rose on the news. \"We control the 10% -- and that gives us access to this marketplace in a way we haven't had in the 10 years that we've done business in China,\" Mr. Goodwin told a conference call. Other foreign banks are looking at the Bank of China. Zurich bank UBS AG has said it is in talks to invest $500 million. Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd., an investment company owned by Singapore's government, and the Asian Development Bank, a Manila-based, multilateral development bank, also are interested in possible Bank of China stakes, banking executives say. Industry analysts said the RBS announcement that it wouldn't be lifting its stake was designed to soothe shareholders. Other foreign investors have been keen to write into their agreements provisions allowing them to expand ownership. In June, Bank of America Corp. agreed to buy a 9% stake in China Construction Bank for $2.5 billion, with a clause permitting it to raise its share to 20% over time. When HSBC Holdings PLC took a 19.9% stake in the Bank of Communications last year for $1.75 billion, it secured the right to double its share if regulations allowed. At present, single foreign investors can take no more than 20% in a Chinese bank, with combined foreign investment capped at 25%.",
        "debiased_text": "HONG KONG -- Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC announced it would form a consortium with a Merrill Lynch & Co. unit and Hong Kong investor Li Ka-shing to acquire a 10% stake in Bank of China for $3.1 billion. Royal Bank of Scotland, the world's sixth-largest bank by market capitalization, will contribute $1.6 billion of the total investment. Bank of China, China's primary foreign-exchange bank, is preparing for a stock-market listing estimated at $4 billion, expected in early 2006. The consortium's allocation will result in Royal Bank of Scotland holding 5.16%, Merrill Lynch 2.84%, and Li Ka-shing 2%, with Royal Bank of Scotland managing the investment and securing a board seat. Li Ka-shing's participation will be conducted through his Li Ka-shing Foundation. The group has agreed to a three-year lock-up period for its shares. This transaction occurs as global investors seek opportunities in China's banking sector ahead of regulatory changes scheduled for late 2006 that will expand foreign participation. Bank of China maintains an extensive network of 11,609 branches. The bank underwent a $22.5 billion recapitalization in 2003 to address nonperforming loans, reducing its bad debt ratio from 16.28% to 5.12% by the end of 2004. The bank has faced operational challenges, including several high-profile cases of financial misconduct by branch officials. Most recently, a former head of the bank's Hong Kong subsidiary received a suspended death sentence for embezzlement. Royal Bank of Scotland's shares had experienced pressure due to investor concerns about the scale of its Chinese investment. The bank operates a limited corporate banking presence in Shanghai. Funding for the Bank of China investment will come from the sale of Royal Bank of Scotland's stake in Banco Santander Central Hispano SA. The bank has stated it will not increase its Bank of China shareholding beyond the current agreement. Other financial institutions including UBS AG, Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd., and the Asian Development Bank have expressed interest in Bank of China investments. Current Chinese banking regulations limit individual foreign ownership to 20% of a domestic bank, with total foreign ownership not exceeding 25%."

        "original_text": "China came under concerted pressure yesterday to use its leverage to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table and stop what the US fears could be preparations for Pyongyang's first underground nuclear weapons test. South Korea, Japan, Russia and the US are increasingly frustrated at North Korea's refusal to return to six-party talks, hosted by China, which have not convened since last June. Senior officials warned the deadlock could not continue for much longer. A senior US official told the Financial Times that if the communist regime did not agree to restart talks on its nuclear weapons capability by next month, then Washington was likely to consider other options, including referral to the UN Security Council for possible sanctions. No deadline had been set. Warning of the \"disastrous\" political and environmental repercussions of a North Korean test, Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Authority, said: \"I hope every leader who has contact with North Korea is on the phone today with North Korean authorities.\" At a meeting hosted by Japan yesterday of Asian and European foreign ministers, South Korea's Ban Ki-moon told Li Zhaoxing, his Chinese counterpart, that Seoul was \"increasingly concerned\" about the lack of progress. \"We requested a more proactive role by the Chinese government to resolve this situation peacefully,\" a South Korean official said. \"We believe China has the biggest influence. We believe that they can do more.\" Nobutaka Machimura, Japan's foreign minister, said Tokyo would be prepared to refer Pyongyang to the UN Security Council if there was no progress on restarting talks. \"We need to think about the Security Council as a next option,\" he told Mr Ban. China insisted its influence was limited. \"China has done a very good job but China alone is not enough,\" Mr Li told reporters. \"We should work with other countries and the international community to push for achieving the goal of anon-nuclear Korean peninsula and for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.\" The US official said North Korea might be preparing to test. But he stressed that intelligence was very uncertain. Last month, Washington urgently asked Beijing to try to stop a possible nuclear test. The New York Times yesterday quoted US officials as saying that a recent stream of satellite imagery appeared to show rapid, extensive preparations, including construction of a reviewing stand and tunnelling into a mountain near Kilju in the north-east. A senior European diplomat based in Pyongyang said he believed it was unlikely that North Korea would go ahead with a test against China's wishes. Opinion in Washington among experts is deeply divided. Some believe North Korea is more interested in improving its negotiating position to extract economic and political concessions in exchange for disarmament.",
        "debiased_text": "Several countries have urged China to use its influence to encourage North Korea to resume negotiations amid concerns about possible preparations for a nuclear test. Representatives from South Korea, Japan, Russia, and the U.S. expressed frustration over North Korea's continued absence from six-party talks, which China hosts and which last took place in June. A U.S. official stated that if North Korea does not agree to return to discussions about its nuclear program by next month, the U.S. may explore alternative measures, such as involving the UN Security Council, though no specific timeline has been established. Meanwhile, Mohamed ElBaradei of the International Atomic Energy Agency emphasized the potential consequences of a nuclear test by North Korea and called for diplomatic engagement. During a meeting of Asian and European foreign ministers in Japan, South Korean officials asked China to take a more active role in facilitating negotiations, citing China's influence in the region. Japan's foreign minister mentioned the possibility of bringing the issue to the UN Security Council if no progress is made. China responded by stating its influence is limited and that international cooperation is necessary to achieve a non-nuclear Korean Peninsula. U.S. officials noted unspecified intelligence suggesting North Korea might be preparing for a test, though they acknowledged uncertainties in the intelligence. Satellite images reportedly show construction activity near Kilju, but a European diplomat in Pyongyang doubted North Korea would proceed with a test against China's wishes. Experts in Washington remain divided on North Korea's intentions, with some viewing its actions as a strategy to strengthen its bargaining position."

        "original_text": "One of Gordon Brown's closest confidantes last night held up the example of the \"disaster\" of the Clinton-Gore transition as a warning of what could go wrong for Labour when Tony Blair steps down. Ed Balls, newly elected MP for Normanton, but better known as Mr Brown's former economic advisor and right hand man, told a party fringe \"there has never been a successful transition [of leader] in power.\" And he told the Fabian fringe the party would face a \"terrible temptation to look backwards\" when the time for a changeover came. His words of warning came after a weekend which saw a queue of ostensibly Blairite cabinet ministers - such as Tessa Jowell and David Blunkett - endorse the chancellor as the only possible successor to the PM. Ms Jowell suggested no leadership election might be necessary, calling it a \"waste of time and a waste of energy\". Patricia Hewitt, the health secretary, added: \"Everybody knows it will be, barring terrible accident, Gordon Brown who takes over.\" Meanwhile David Blunkett, the work and pensions secretary, said it was \"blindingly obvious\" that Mr Brown would take over. At last night's Fabian Society fringe, Mr Balls warned against assuming things would be so straightforward. He said: \"There has never been a successful transition in power\". He pointed to the traumatic replacement of Harold Wilson by Jim Callaghan - after which Labour lost the 1979 election and suffered 18 years in opposition - and the overthrow of Mrs Thatcher by her party, which he said was still \"unfinished business\", referring to the Tories' five leaders in eight years and current leadership battles. Mr Balls said the attempted handover in 2000 from US President Clinton to his deputy, Al Gore, was a disaster. He told a Fabian fringe meeting: \"There's a terrible temptation to look backwards, not forwards. To have debates, not unity of purpose. \"There are big, transitional challenges on the policy agenda - understanding poverty, China, India - and we need to face them in an open, forward-looking and unified way. \"It [the transition] needs to be orderly and respect the party.\"",

        "title": "Max Hastings: It's too easy to condemn Hiroshima bombing",
        "original_text": "The 60th anniversary of the dropping of the first atomic bomb falls a week today. The occasion will be marked by a torrent of prose from those who regard the destruction of Hiroshima and of Nagasaki three days later as \"war crimes\", forever attaching shame to those who ordered them. By contrast, there will be a plethora of dismissive comment from pundits who believe the nuclear assault saved a million allied casualties in 1945, by causing Japan to surrender without an invasion of its mainland. Plentiful evidence is available to both schools. In the spring of 1945, Americans fighting in the Pacific were awed by the suicidal resistance they encountered. Hundreds of Japanese pilots, thousands of soldiers and civilians, immolated themselves, inflicting heavy US losses, rather than accept the logic of surrender. It was well-known that the Japanese forces were preparing a similar sacrificial defence of their homeland. Allied planning for an invasion in the autumn of 1945 assumed hundreds of thousands of casualties. Allied soldiers - and prisoners - in the far east were profoundly grateful when the atomic bombs, in their eyes, saved their lives. On the other side of the argument is the fact that in the summer of 1945 Japan's economy was collapsing. The US submarine blockade had strangled oil and raw-materials supply lines. Air attack had destroyed many factories, and 60% of civilian housing. Some authoritative Washington analysts asserted that Japan's morale was cracking. Intercepts of Japanese diplomatic cables revealed to Washington that Tokyo was soliciting Stalin's good offices to end the war. The Americans were also aware of the Soviets' imminent intention to invade Japanese-occupied China in overwhelming strength. In short, the 2005 evidence demonstrates that Japan had no chance of sustaining effective resistance. If America's fleets had merely lingered offshore through autumn 1945, they could have watched the Japanese people, already desperately hungry, starve to death or perish beneath conventional bombing. Oddly enough, Soviet entry into the war on August 8 was more influential than the atomic explosions in convincing Japanese leaders that they must quit. In some eyes, this adds up to a devastating indictment against President Harry Truman, who launched the most murderous weapon in history against a nation already doomed. How is it possible, in the light of such facts, for students like me to retain sympathy - enthusiasm is impossible - for Truman's decision? The foremost answer is that much we now know was then uncertain. Amid their defeats in 1941-42, the allies had developed an exaggerated respect for their enemy's might. They did not comprehend in 1945 how close was Japan's industrial collapse. Second, although Tokyo plainly wanted to escape from the war, its terms remained confused. There is little doubt that if Washington had explicitly promised that the emperor might retain his throne, Japan would have bowed. But so faltering and divided was Japan's leadership that the US still possessed grounds for real doubt about Tokyo's intentions. And why should Washington offer guarantees for Hirohito's future when he had been at least the figurehead for Japan's terrible deeds? Many Japanese generals bitterly opposed surrender even after the Soviet invasion, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was not that they deluded themselves that they could win. Rather, they preferred death to humiliation. All wars brutalise all participants, but both sides in the Pacific had become exceptionally desensitised. The great war correspondent Ernie Pyle wrote shortly before his own death in combat: \"In Europe we felt that our enemies, horrible and deadly as they were, were still people. But out here I soon gathered that the Japanese were looked upon as something subhuman and repulsive, the way people feel about cockroaches and mice.\" Japan's occupation of China had cost 15 million Chinese lives. Civilians had been raped, tortured, enslaved and massacred, while British and US prisoners were subjected to hideous maltreatment. The Japanese had been waging biological warfare in China. Their notorious Unit 731 subjected hundreds of prisoners to vivisection. Many captured American airmen were beheaded. Some were eaten. A B-29 crew was dissected alive at a Japanese city hospital. Americans, in their turn, showed themselves reluctant to take prisoners. They subjected Japan's cities to the vast fire-bombing raids which began in March 1945, killing half a million people. Lawrence Freedman and Saki Dockrill, in a powerful analysis, argue that the nuclear assault must be perceived in the context of the deadly incendiary raids that preceded it: \"Nobody involved in the decision on the atomic bombs could have seen themselves as setting new precedents for mass destruction in scale - only in efficiency.\" More people - 100,000 - died in the March 9 Tokyo incendiary attack than at Hiroshima. We may dismiss conspiracy theories that Hiroshima was a first shot in the cold war, designed to impress the Soviets. Rather, the use of a \"total\" weapon reflected the inexorable logic of total war. Amid a conflict in which 50 million people had already died, those who dispatched the Enola Gay viewed the judgment with gravity, but without the sense of uniqueness that posterity perceives as appropriate. Uncertainty persisted in August 1945 about whether the bombs would work. This was one reason for Washington's reluctance to stage an offshore demonstration, though more potent was a desire to administer to the enemy a devastating shock, such as only city attacks were thought able to achieve. The decision-makers were men who had grown accustomed to the necessity for cruel judgments. There was overwhelming technological momentum: a titanic effort had been made to create a weapon for which the allies saw themselves as competing with their foes. After Hiroshima, General Leslie Groves, chief of the Manhattan Project, was almost the only man to succumb to triumphalism. He said: \"We have spent $2bn on the greatest scientific gamble in history - we won.\" Having devoted such resources to the bomb, an extraordinary initiative would have been needed from Truman to arrest its employment. Those who today find it easy to condemn the architects of Hiroshima sometimes seem to lack humility in recognising the frailties of the decision-makers, mortal men grappling with dilemmas of a magnitude our own generation has been spared. In August 1945, amid a world sick of death in the cause of defeating evil, allied lives seemed very precious, while the enemy appeared to value neither his own nor those of the innocent. Truman's Hiroshima judgment may seem wrong in the eyes of posterity, but it is easy to understand why it seemed right to most of his contemporaries. · Max Hastings, author of Armageddon: The Battle for Germany 1944-45, is currently researching a study of the war against Japan",
        "debiased_text": "The 60th anniversary of the first atomic bombing of Hiroshima will occur in one week, followed three days later by the anniversary of the Nagasaki bombing. Historical perspectives on these events remain divided. One view considers the bombings as actions that hastened Japan's surrender, potentially preventing significant Allied casualties that an invasion of mainland Japan might have incurred. Another perspective argues that Japan was already nearing defeat due to economic collapse, a naval blockade, and sustained conventional bombing campaigns. Archival records indicate that by mid-1945, Japan's industrial capacity was severely degraded, and Soviet forces were preparing to enter the conflict. Some historical analyses suggest Japanese diplomats were seeking mediated peace terms through the Soviet Union before the atomic bombings occurred. Military planners at the time projected high casualty estimates for a potential invasion of Japan. Contemporary documents show Allied forces were operating without full knowledge of Japan's deteriorating military situation or the potential efficacy of alternative strategies to force surrender. The decision to employ atomic weapons followed years of research and development during which Allied and Axis powers were competing to develop advanced weaponry. Post-war records indicate that conventional firebombing campaigns preceding the atomic strikes had already caused substantial destruction and loss of life in Japanese cities. Historical accounts document that political and military leaders made the decision to use atomic weapons within the context of ongoing total war, where previous boundaries on military tactics had been repeatedly expanded. Debate continues among historians regarding the comparative influence of the atomic bombings versus the Soviet declaration of war in compelling Japan's surrender."

        "title": "'Stick with Labour', Brown tells City",
        "original_text": "Gordon Brown today sought to highlight Labour's economic record as opinion polls show many voters increasingly prefer Tory policies on tax and public spending. Giving his last speech before Tony Blair's expected visit to Buckingham Palace today to start the general election campaign, the chancellor urged the City to stick with Labour. Addressing business leaders at a breakfast speech in the heart of the financial district, Mr Brown promised a third Labour term of investment in science to equip Britain to compete with China and India. Mr Brown painted the general election as a choice between a Labour party committed to ensuring Britain is ready to meet future economic challenges and a Conservative party unwilling to make the necessary investment. His comments came as the Guardian/ICM poll suggested Labour's lead over the Tories on tax and public spending has slipped by seven points, from 10 to three. In a speech which recounted the government's eight-year track record in office, with highlights from last month's budget, Mr Brown said: \"The government that has over eight years created the conditions for stability, employment and investment will seek a mandate to prepare and equip Britain for the next set of global challenges.\" Mr Brown highlighted the government's plans for investing long term in skills, science and enterprise, helping families trying to balance work and family life, and investing in and reforming public services. Mr Brown said that, above all, the government had a \"determination to be long-termist not short-termist\" and would take no risk with the stability created. He dismissed suggestions that there was little difference between the parties' economic policies. He said the next government faced the crucial challenge of ensuring long-term prosperity for the British people. He said it was a challenge which could either be \"seized or squandered\" and that could only be met if Britain had a government that was on the side of hard-working families and that would equip the country for the changing world. In his speech at the Bloomberg financial information agency, Mr Brown said the economy went to the heart of the issues of any election. \"An election is not just a choice about who is to govern, it is a choice about what is the future direction of the country, a contest not just of political organisation but of governing philosophies. \"And in the campaign ahead, Britain will face a fundamental choice that will not only define the future of our economy but the long-term strength of our society.\" Mr Brown said Britain had \"no time to lose\" in rising to the challenge set by the emerging Asian economies. He said a third-term Labour government would put Britain in a position to become \"one of the global economy's great success stories\" of the future. But he said a Tory government would put that at risk. \"In each of the economic responsibilities I have discussed - the responsibilities for stability, for investing in science, skills employment and business support - there are profound differences between our opponents and us over the direction which Britain must take. \"That is why Labour's manifesto will show how we will lock in stability, enhance flexibility and invest for success - success that would not be possible if we neglected science, abolished the New Deal and Small Business Service, and put money for universities, transport, housing and other vital infrastructure in a £35bn programme of cuts.\" The chancellor emphasised \"Britain's chronic post-war history of stop-go, inflation, short-termism and high unemployment\". He also emphasised how the economy was allowed to run out of control during the world downturn in the early 1990s. Mr Brown said he was pleased that forecasting organisations, which doubted the government last year and again this year, are now \"accepting our growth will be one of the highest of the major economies\". He added that, while this year's euro area growth was expected to be just over 1.5%, growth would be between 3% and 3.5% in Britain. Mr Brown cautioned against opposition policies that were \"bad for Britain's long-term future, that would complacently assume that our stability is a given that any party could maintain without risking the return of the old stop-go\".",
        "debiased_text": "Gordon Brown delivered a speech today addressing Labour's economic policies as recent polls indicate a shift in voter preferences toward Conservative positions on tax and public spending. Speaking before the expected start of the general election campaign, Brown urged business leaders in the financial district to support Labour. He outlined plans for long-term investments in science, skills, and enterprise to position Britain competitively against growing economies like China and India. Brown framed the election as a decision between Labour’s commitment to future economic preparedness and Conservative approaches to fiscal policy. The speech referenced a Guardian/ICM poll showing Labour’s lead on tax and spending had decreased from 10 to 3 points. Brown highlighted Labour’s eight-year record in government, citing stability, employment, and investment as key achievements. He emphasized the importance of long-term planning in skills, science, and public service reform. Brown rejected claims of minimal differences between party economic policies, stating the next government must address long-term prosperity. Speaking at Bloomberg, Brown asserted that elections determine a country’s economic and societal direction. He warned against policies he said could undermine stability, referencing past economic volatility in the 1990s. Brown noted that forecasters now project Britain’s growth to be among the highest of major economies, with estimates between 3% and 3.5%, compared to 1.5% in the euro area. He cautioned that opposition policies could risk economic stability."

        "title": "Press review: Deadly flu strain poses global threat",
        "original_text": "A virulent form of bird flu that has already caused dozens of deaths in Asia has prompted fears of a worldwide flu pandemic. But how great is the threat? What is pandemic flu and where does it come from? It is a completely new strain of flu, caused by a major shift in the genetic make-up of the virus, to which people would have no immunity and which would consequently spread rapidly round the globe ... [It would probably come] from the far east, where there is currently an epidemic of avian flu infecting chickens and other birds. Humans who live in close contact with the birds and develop human flu provide the ideal environment for the viruses to mingle and genetically \"reassort\" to produce a pandemic strain. · From the Irish Independent, March 2 Why the panic? Flu pandemics occur every few decades, the last one in 1968, and scientists have warned for years that we're due for another. Since 1997, when a flu virus that is deadly to chickens jumped species in Hong Kong and killed six of the 18 people known to be infected, the drumbeat has grown louder. Last year, avian flu swept across Asia, infecting poultry flocks in 10 countries and turning up in other species, including tigers, migratory birds and domestic ducks. Efforts to stop it, which include the slaughter of millions of chickens, have been unsuccessful. Scientists now say the virus, known to scientists as H5N1, is entrenched in parts of Asia. · Anita Manning in USA Today, February 28 Why are health officials so worried? There is currently no vaccine against H5N1, so it could spread easily in populations with no immunity to the virus. So far, there have been no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission (all victims so far have contracted it from chickens or ducks). But because the virus is so unstable, it may only be a matter of time before it becomes efficient at moving from person to person. Even if a vaccine were available, it would take months before the correct combination of viral-strain types could be incorporated into the shot. In the meantime, millions of people could get infected. · Alice Park in Time, March 7 Is it really serious? Asian bird flu has so far killed 40 people in China, Vietnam and Thailand, and it is now suspected of having spread from person to person, instead of just from birds to humans. It is fatal in at least two-thirds of cases and the World Health Organisation has warned the disease could mutate into a new form with the potential to kill millions. It said it is almost inevitable a pandemic will hit, and has warned that governments must be ready. · Rebecca Smith in the Evening Standard, London, March 1 What are the symptoms? The same as ordinary flu initially - headache, fever, muscle and joint pains. As the illness progresses, complications such as pneumonia could lead to death. · Jeremy Laurance in the Independent, March 2 What is the government doing? The government took out a £200m insurance policy ... Under political pressure and on the eve of a World Health Organisation meeting in Luxembourg to discuss flu preparedness, the Department of Health rushed out a plan based on buying 14.6m courses of the antiviral drug Tamiflu. The plan says that more than 53,000 people could die in a pandemic in Britain unless precautions are taken. The only sure defence is a vaccine, but that cannot be made until the precise make-up of any pandemic strain is known. · Nigel Hawkes in the Times, March 2 Is the risk overblown? Experts who assert that H5N1 is steadily progressing towards pandemic form are going too far, says Richard Schabas, former chief medical officer of Ontario ... \"We have no idea why some avian flu strains leap the species boundary to spread in humans,\" he explains. \"For all we know, there may be hundreds of viruses that have gone down this route [of infecting birds as H5N1 has] and didn't make the grade\" as human strains. If so, the odds that H5N1 will mutate into a Spanish flu lookalike may be much smaller than has been suggested by all the alarming headlines about it. · David Stipp in Fortune, March 7",
        "debiased_text": "A strain of bird flu that has resulted in multiple fatalities in Asia has raised concerns about the potential for a global flu pandemic. Pandemic flu is caused by a significant genetic change in the virus, creating a new strain to which humans have no immunity, potentially leading to widespread transmission. Researchers note that such strains often emerge in regions like East Asia, where avian flu outbreaks in poultry are occurring. Close contact between infected birds and humans with flu may facilitate genetic reassortment, increasing the risk of a pandemic strain. The most recent flu pandemic occurred in 1968, and scientists have indicated that another could occur. Since 1997, when a chicken flu virus infected humans in Hong Kong, avian flu has spread across Asia, affecting poultry and other species. Efforts to control outbreaks, including culling poultry, have not halted the virus, identified as H5N1, which is now considered endemic in parts of Asia. Health officials are concerned because no vaccine currently exists for H5N1, making populations vulnerable. To date, human-to-human transmission has not been confirmed, but the virus's instability increases the possibility of adaptation. Vaccine development would require months to match a pandemic strain. In Asia, H5N1 has caused fatalities, and limited person-to-person transmission is under investigation. The World Health Organization has stated that a pandemic is likely and urged governments to prepare. Common initial symptoms mirror those of seasonal flu, but severe cases may lead to fatal complications. Some governments have allocated funds for antiviral stockpiles as a precaution. Public health strategies emphasize vaccine development, but production depends on identifying a pandemic strain. Some experts caution that predictions about H5N1 evolving into a human pandemic strain remain uncertain, as not all avian flu viruses adapt to widespread human transmission."

        "title": "Violence flares as the Chinese rage at Japan",
        "original_text": "For most of the tens of thousands of anti-Japanese demonstrators who took to the streets of Shanghai yesterday, it was the first public protest they had ever seen, let alone taken part in. A few over the age of 35 remembered the pro-democracy campaign of 1989. A handful had joined small anti-American rallies in 1999. But for almost an entire generation this was their first chance to march for a cause. The result was a strongly worded Japanese protest to China, after the rampage saw the Japanese consulate attacked, restaurants shattered and at least two people severely beaten. 'I saw hundreds of people kicking and beating the two men. Police tried to intervene, but they couldn't get through the crowd,' said a businessman in his thirties who only gave his surname, Wang. 'Everyone said they had been killed.' The demonstrations had started small, scattered and peaceful. At 9am there were a few hundred students near the Bund, Shanghai's river-front, several thousand more in People's Square and hundreds more here and there throughout the downtown area. Some were singing the national anthem, others chanted anti-Japanese insults and vowed to defend China with their lives. A few wore T-shirts emblazoned with the blood-splattered face of Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Many handed out leaflets with a list of Japanese products to be boycotted. Banners called on Tokyo to face up to its wartime atrocities and give up islands that the two countries are both claiming. One slogan, however, was to prove particularly prescient: 'When the Chinese people get angry, the result is always big trouble.' By noon there were at least three groups - the smallest of 5,000, the largest in the tens of thousands. With people coming and going throughout the day, it was one of the biggest displays of people power that China has seen since the protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. It was also one of the most violent. On Hushanguan road, a mob threw a bicycle through the windows of a Japanese okonomiyaki restaurant. In a nearby shopping district, protesters broke windows at about 10 Japanese-style noodle shops and bars - many of them Chinese-owned. Several Japanese-made cars were pelted with bottles and gravel, regardless of the nationality of the drivers. When the largest group reached the Japanese consulate, they jostled with riot police who allowed them to throw bottles and stones at the building. The walls were splattered with black and red paint and solar panels on the roof were smashed. 'Japanese pigs get out!' they shouted in a stand-off that lasted hours. Among the participants was a group of three 11-year-old girls, carrying a banner reading: 'Boycott Japanese products.' Elsewhere, China was on the march. In Hangzhou and Tianjin, crowds - some in the hundreds, some in the thousands - staged anti-Japanese rallies. In Nanjing, a group of more than 300 students resisted police attempts to break up their rally for more than two hours, before the organisers were arrested. More demonstrations are reportedly being planned today in Shenyang, Jinan, Hong Kong, Chengdu, Shijiazhuang, Changsha, Baoding ... the list goes on. This is the third weekend of anti-Japanese protests and they have grown bigger each time. The immediate effect has been to plunge bilateral relations to their lowest point in 33 years. In the longer term, they may yet pose a threat to a communist government that has released a wave of nationalism that could prove difficult to reverse. Japan's Foreign Minister, Nobutaka Machimura, flies to Beijing today on what was supposed to be a hastily arranged fence-mending mission, but in several cities the Chinese authorities have prepared for his visit by bringing people onto the streets. Although the government insists the rallies are spontaneous, it could control them if it wanted. That much was apparent yesterday in Beijing, where students were reportedly confined to their dormitories and hundreds of police were checking the identities of people who attempted to enter Tiananmen Square. In Guangzhou, the authorities broke up a planned rally at a football stadium. But in Shanghai the police not only approved yesterday's demonstration, they actively encouraged it. At 4.30pm last Thursday, mobile phones in Shanghai buzzed with a text-message from the municipal security office calling on local people to show their love for their country in a law-abiding way. Many among the millions who received the message took it as a green light to join the demonstration. News about the rally was also broadcast by the Shanghai radio station, which informed people about the march while also announcing that it was unauthorised. During the past week the governments of both countries have stoked passions further. The Japanese Economics Minister labelled China 'a scary country'. On Wednesday, Tokyo deliberately provoked Beijing by announcing the start of oil and gas exploration in waters claimed by China. The same day Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao announced that his country would oppose Japan's bid to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The spark for the latest row was Tokyo's approval of a new history textbook that whitewashes Japan's wartime atrocities, including the massacre of tens - possibly hundreds - of thousands of civilians in Nanjing in 1937; the forced recruitment of 'comfort women' who were made to work as sex slaves in Japanese army brothels; and the infamous Unit 731's deadly tests of biological weapons on entire Chinese villages. The offending books, which are published by a right-wing nationalist group, are used in fewer than 1 per cent of Japan's schools because the vast majority of teachers agree that they distort history. But their very existence is seen by the country's neighbours as proof that Japan's leaders refuse to face up to the past. Such claims are nothing new, but the latest dispute is about far more than history. It is the result of a tectonic shift in East Asia as China grows more powerful and Japan moves closer to the United States to protect its interests. Long-term trends, including a rise of nationalism and an increase of militarism throughout the region, are pushing the two East Asian giants further apart and raising the risk of conflict. For the first two decades after the two countries restored diplomatic relations in 1972, Japan treated China as a pitiful backward nation in need of charity. But in the past few years this friendly-but-patronising view has been replaced by one of suspicion and fear. In the 1990s China's economy surged forward by more 9 per cent per year, while Japan's crawled along at a rate of 1 per cent. Although Japan is still far richer than its giant neighbour, the gap is closing. The two are now locked in competition for regional influence and resources. Beijing is racing Tokyo to sign free trade pacts with other Asian nations. As the world's second- and third-biggest oil consumers, they are also rivals for energy, which has led to tetchy rows over a Siberian oil pipeline and gas fields in the South China Sea. Chinese anger is not limited to a specific issue or location. In August 2003, demonstrators in the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang took to the streets after the agonising death of a construction worker who uncovered a Japanese chemical bomb left over from the Second World War. The same month a million people signed an internet petition against a Japanese bid to build the lucrative Shanghai-to-Beijing high-speed rail link. Fury erupted again in September 2003 when the media reported that 400 Japanese tourists had hired 500 Chinese prostitutes for a two-day orgy in the south-eastern resort of Zhuhai. Hopes that the rapid spread of the internet in China would lead to an increase of open democratic debate also appear to have proved wide of the mark. While many sites promoting human rights and religious beliefs are blocked, a plethora of anti-Japanese sites have been largely free to promote hatred. Last year Japan's trade with China rose by 27 per cent to £89 billion - a boom that has been credited with lifting Japan out of recession. But a growing number of young Chinese consumers are now refusing to buy 'enemy' products. This has prompted the China Chain Store and Franchise Association, which accounts for about 10 per cent of retail sales, to advise its members to remove Japanese-made goods from store shelves. Nongunshan Jituan, a chain of 1,200 supermarkets, has declared that it will stop selling products made by companies deemed to be sympathetic to the new textbooks. Such problems might be quickly resolved if the leaders of the two nations had the sort of relationship in which they could privately exchange views. But the Chinese President, Hu Jintao, and the Japanese Prime Minister, Junichiro Koizumi, are barely on speaking terms. China has refused Japanese requests for a bilateral summit since 1999. Beijing is particularly enraged by Koizumi's insistence on making an annual visit to the Yasukuni war shrine, which honours - among millions of others - terrible war criminals. According to the Japanese media, the two leaders are not even in telephone contact. What meetings do take place are snatched - and often bad-natured - talks on the sidelines of multilateral summits, the last of which was more than five months ago. Japan's efforts to make amends for the past have been at best hamfisted, at worst insincere. When the two nations restored diplomatic relations in the early 1970s, Japan dodged the issue of wartime responsibility with a statement of regret and a promise to provide huge sums of economic aid. China agreed to waive all claims for compensation - instead of haggling over its population's right for recompense, Beijing settled for new bridges, dams and airports. At the time this must have seemed a brilliant face-saving compromise for Tokyo, but it has proved a public relations disaster. Despite numerous apologies by its leaders, Japan is still seen as the country that cannot say sorry. And because billions of dollars of compensation went quietly to Beijing in the form of cheap loans and aid grants, few Chinese people are aware of the contribution made by Japan to their country's economic development. Instead they read newspaper headlines about elderly comfort women and the relatives of germ warfare victims being denied justice in Tokyo's courts. The development aid that served as a substitute for compensation is now drying up. After a decade in which Japan's economy shrank while China's surged forward, politicians in Tokyo are refusing to pay for their neighbour's friendship. Last year Japan announced a 20 per cent cut in cheap loans it provides to China - the third straight annual reduction. Koizumi has said such aid will soon end. A shift in ideology in China is making matters worse. Communist cadres openly acknowledge that nationalism is replacing Marxism as the raison d'être of the ruling party. 'Nobody understands Marxism. It is ridiculous,' says Li Rui, a former secretary of Mao Zedong. 'The ideals of the past don't exist any more. So it is right to turn to nationalism. It is the means by which the party can maintain its system and ideology.' There is certainly a deep well of public hostility towards Japan that the government can tap whenever it wishes to score diplomatic points against its neighbour or distract attention from domestic problems. That much was evident at last weekend's demonstrations, which were approved and carefully controlled by the authorities. In a tactic that reflected the long-term priorities of the government, riot police steered the protesters away from Tiananmen Square - the main focus of domestic unrest - and towards the Japanese embassy, where they stood by idly as the demonstrators stoned the windows. For the government, incidents of urban students abusing foreigners are far less threatening and more controllable than those of peasants beating up police in impoverished villages, as was the case in Zhajiang province last week. But China's leaders are not alone in whipping up nationalist feeling. It is no coincidence that bilateral relations have worsened since Koizumi took power. Under his leadership, Japan has moved to revise its pacifist constitution and redefine the role of the self-defence forces. Most controversially, it named Taiwan for the first time as a shared strategic concern under its security treaty with the United States. This has led many in Beijing to fear that Japan is being encouraged by the US to abandon its pacifist stance so that it can help contain a resurgent China. Wenran Jiang, an associate professor of political science at the University of Alberta, said the recent protests in China and South Korea showed the folly of Japan's actions: 'It is clearly a wake-up call for Japan's hardline leadership that its China policy in the past four years has backfired. Koizumi's wishful thinking that he could prevail and China would have to live with what he does regarding Yasukuni and other things is now replaced by the reality that the damage is severe.' Tokyo has watched with alarm as China's military spending has surged forward at double-digit pace for almost two decades. Beijing is equally concerned that it was named for the first time as a potential threat in the latest Japanese defence white paper. The most likely flashpoints are Taiwan or the tiny islands in the East China Sea that the two nations are both claiming in order to expand their territorial waters. War is not on the horizon, but smaller-scale clashes are a distinct possibility. One could have occurred last November, when Japan mounted only its second maritime policing operation since the Second World War in response to the intrusion of a Chinese Han-class nuclear submarine in waters close to the disputed islands. No shots were fired but with Beijing's fleet growing bigger and bolder as the country becomes richer and more defiantly anti-Japanese, the same might not be true next time. With the exception of trade, almost all the trends in the bilateral relationship are pointing in a worrying direction. Tokyo has failed to overcome its past, yet it is rushing to embrace an American - rather than Asian - future. Beijing is cursed with a backward political system, yet instead of reform it has spawned a virulent nationalism as a substitute for ideology. And all the time, the power balance is shifting as China rises and Japan declines. 'Unlike past rows, this is not just a passing phenomenon. There has always been a rabid anti-Japanese minority in China, but such views have now spread to moderates and people who would usually consider themselves non-political. It is hot now to be anti-Japanese,' says Linda Jakobson, senior researcher at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. 'In the long run, Japan-China relations will be a major source of worry for East Asia.' Many of the protesters agreed that their activism was no passing fad. 'I've sold my Japanese car and I'm going to replace my Sony laptop with an IBM,' said He Pei, an American-educated Shanghai woman in her thirties. 'I've even stopped using Japanese cosmetic products for three months, which was really hard because they are the best.' Asked why the demonstrations were taking place now rather than in the past, she paused for a moment. 'Maybe this is happening because China is becoming more powerful.'

        "original_text": "The new Iraqi government was sworn in on Tuesday against a backdrop of another wave of insurgent attacks. The latest violence in a week of bloodshed saw at least 60 Iraqis killed in a suicide bombing at a police recruitment centre in the Kurdish city of Irbil yesterday. The historic formation of a cabinet \"came not with a bang, but a shrug\", said Fawaz Turki in the Saudi Arab News. \"Many Iraqis, especially democrats weary of a government that derives its legitimacy from ethnic representation, and that has excluded all former Ba'athists ... are concerned over whether Iraq is headed toward civil war and whether the new prime minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, can summon the vision to avert disaster.\" \"Each of Mr Jaafari's faltering steps towards achieving national unity,\" said John R Bradley in the Singapore Straits Times, \"has been matched by the leaps and bounds of the insurgents.\" The violence - in all its forms - had made Iraq \"a living hell for many of its long-suffering people\", said the Financial Times. Civil war, warned the South China Morning Post, remained \"a very worrying possibility\". Missing from the cabinet sworn in this week were a handful of permanent ministerial appointments earmarked for the minority Sunnis - most important among them, observers agreed, being the defence portfolio. Sunni nominees had been vetoed by Shias \"because of [their] alleged Ba'ath party past\", explained Trudy Rubin in the Philadelphia Inquirer. The test of \"whether calmer Shia heads have prevailed\", she said, \"will be whether a respectable Sunni is found to head the defence ministry. Soon.\" \"The hope still is that by bringing credible Sunni figures on board, the government may be able to start winning political ground away from the insurgents,\" said the Qatar-based Gulf Times. But \"by prolonging the wrangling\", it added, \"it is the Iraqis who stand to lose. They ... can ill afford to lose any further.\" For the New York Post columnist Amir Taheri, however, delays did not necessarily mean failure. Instead, he suggested, they \"should be regarded as a positive sign that the new Iraqi leadership is learning the art of power-sharing\".",

On the same day, a suicide bombing at a police recruitment center in the Kurdish city of Irbil resulted in at least 60 Iraqi fatalities. The cabinet formation included several temporary appointments, with some permanent positions for minority Sunnis remaining unfilled. Observers noted the defense ministry position, in particular, had not been assigned. Reports indicated that Sunni nominees were rejected by Shia officials due to alleged past affiliations with the Ba'ath party. Some analysts suggested that involving credible Sunni leaders could help reduce insurgent influence, while others viewed delays in appointments as part of the negotiation process for power-sharing."

        "title": "Leader: Time for a cut in interest rates",
        "original_text": "The Bank of England ought to cut interest rates - currently 4.75% - by 0.25% when its monetary policy committee ends two days of deliberations tomorrow. The reason is simple: the dangers arising from a sharp slowdown in economic growth are now significantly greater than the risks associated with higher inflation. The UK economy has been on a roll for an unprecedented period and is still growing faster than most European countries. But it is not growing nearly as fast as the government needs in order to fulfil its budget targets and to finance the higher level of public spending to which it is committed. Demand for goods and services from industry and individuals has weakened for six consecutive quarters. The Bank was not too worried about this weakness when it was confined to goods, but in recent weeks it has spread to the service industries as well. New figures published yesterday show that manufacturing output contracted by 1.9% in the three months to May. This makes it unlikely that output will meet the budget's target expansion of 1.75% this year. Although manufacturing is a comparatively small proportion of the economy these days - and may get even smaller now that China is aiming cheap cars at the European market - it remains vital to the export effort. The Treasury forecast of a 6.25% surge in exports this year looks unattainable now. It has been something of a miracle that a prolonged consumer boom in the UK has not yet generated the kind of inflation that it used to do. When the history books are written this will probably be attributed to globalisation (in the form of cheap imports), strong monetary policy and immigration, which have enabled firms and individuals to use cheaper labour from eastern Europe as a buffer against wage increases. The benefits of this may be starting to come to an end. The consumer price index is now recording annual inflation of 1.9% compared with 1.1% earlier in the year, despite a sharp slowing down in housing prices. But this is still below the government's target of 2% inflation and, since the Bank allowed inflation to undershoot the 2% target for a long time, maybe it should be just as relaxed if it goes over the target for a temporary period. The long-term threat to inflation is not great (unless immigrants leave en masse), but the short-term threat to manufacturing and the service industries is considerable. The main debating point at the bank today and tomorrow ought to be not whether interest rates should be cut, but whether there may have to be a second cut fairly soon as well.",
        "debiased_text": "The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will conclude two days of deliberations tomorrow, with interest rates currently set at 4.75%. Recent economic data shows the UK economy growing faster than most European nations, though below the government's budget target growth rate. Demand for goods and services has declined for six consecutive quarters, initially in manufacturing and recently extending to service industries. Yesterday's figures revealed a 1.9% contraction in manufacturing output for the three months leading to May, making the budget's target expansion of 1.75% unlikely to be met this year. While manufacturing represents a smaller portion of the economy today, it remains significant for exports, with the Treasury's forecast of 6.25% export growth now appearing challenging. The consumer price index shows annual inflation at 1.9%, up from 1.1% earlier in the year, though still below the government's 2% target. Housing prices have shown a significant slowdown. The Monetary Policy Committee will discuss potential interest rate adjustments during its meeting."

        "title": "Leader: The budget",
        "original_text": "Gordon Brown will deliver his ninth budget on Wednesday in surprisingly resilient circumstances. For most of the past year his political critics, and most forecasting bodies, have predicted a black hole in the accounts as a result of ailing tax revenues failing to fund his big spending plans. In fact, a surge of tax income from corporations and North Sea oil has - as the Treasury said a year ago - come to his rescue. Instead of being forced to raise taxes, Mr Brown could have a billion to give away in pre-electoral largesse without breaking his \"golden rule\" that all spending (other than for investment) must be met by tax revenues. Whether all this is down to Mr Brown's good judgment or good luck is a matter for future debate. Politically, all it means is that accusations of a £10bn to £11bn deficit have been put back a year. The Conservatives now claim that taxes will have to be raised next year, and paint the unlikely scenario (strongly denied by the Treasury at the weekend) that the government is planning a capital gains tax on first homes. As taxes go, one levied on capital gains is a pretty fair one since it is only taxing fortuitous, unearned, increases in wealth caused by a housing shortage. But the idea that it would be imposed by a Labour government desperate to attract the upwardly mobile middle classes and deeply anxious to avoid a housing crash is, as one Treasury official commented yesterday, \"barking\". Although the budget will undoubtedly distribute pre-electoral goodies to help the poor (such as pensioners facing steep council tax bills) as well as those whose political support Labour needs (the floating middles), it will also be a surprisingly long-term budget for a party that is beginning to become worried about the prospect of losing an election. Mr Brown's visit to China has strengthened his belief - and he is absolutely right - that Britain has to hugely upgrade its skills base to have any chance of competing with the highly skilled, but low- paid, graduates coming out of Indian and Chinese universities by the millions. But this highly focussed concern for the micro-economy - which sets this chancellor apart from nearly all his predecessors - exists side by side with a compulsion to plug any gaps that might enable the Tories to offer something new. Hence Mr Brown is under pressure to lift the threshold at which inheritance tax is paid on homes and to reduce stamp duty for first time buyers. This would be fine for getting a good headline - but lowering stamp duty might simply increase the number of first-time buyers making a purchase, thereby putting prices up. Far better to spend the cash on new homes - thereby increasing supply. More important is what is going to happen to the economy. Mr Brown has yet again confounded his critics because growth in 2004 unexpectedly hit the range of 3% to 3.5% laid down in last year's budget at a time when independent forecasters, as well as opposition politicians, thought otherwise. It will be more difficult to do this in future because public spending is planned to slow down after the surges of recent years. This will make it easier to keep within the golden rule (as will clamping down on tax avoidance) but it will reduce the thrust of a key engine of growth when manufacturing is under the cosh and the housing market vulnerable. There is no case for the Bank to raise interest rates in the run-up to the election. There is no sign that excessive growth will push inflation above the 2% target two years from now (the time needed before rate changes fully affect inflation). The Bank should therefore keep rates on hold. Since inflation was allowed to sink to almost 1% without causing alarm, a temporary rise above the 2% target two years hence would not be a disaster. Monetary policy is not a budgetary matter - but it could determine whether the budget succeeds or not.",
        "debiased_text": "Gordon Brown is set to present his ninth budget on Wednesday. Over the past year, various forecasting bodies and political critics have anticipated a budget shortfall due to lower-than-expected tax revenues. However, increased tax income from corporations and North Sea oil has improved the financial outlook, as previously indicated by the Treasury. Reports suggest that Mr. Brown may have approximately £1 billion available for pre-electoral spending without violating his fiscal rule requiring current spending to be funded by tax revenues. The opposition Conservatives argue that tax increases are likely in the coming year and have raised concerns about potential changes to capital gains tax on primary residences, though the Treasury has dismissed these claims. The budget is expected to include measures aimed at assisting pensioners with council tax bills, among other provisions. Mr. Brown has also emphasized the need for Britain to enhance its skills base to remain competitive globally, following his visit to China. Additionally, discussions have surfaced regarding potential adjustments to inheritance tax thresholds and stamp duty rates for first-time homebuyers, though the economic implications of such changes remain uncertain. Economic growth in 2024 reached between 3% and 3.5%, contrary to some forecasts. Future economic performance may be impacted by a planned slowdown in public spending. The Bank of England faces no immediate pressure to raise interest rates, as inflation expectations remain within target."

        "title": "Fred Halliday: It's time to bin the past",
        "original_text": "The thinkers and managers of world hegemony met amid the snow in Davos, Swizerland, last week while the anti-globalisation forces convened in the tropical summer of Porto Alegre, Brazil. As they assembled, the international system presented a much clearer picture than that through which the world had moved in the 14 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. In America we can see a President resolute in international bellicosity and a national consensus arrogantly indifferent to external concerns. We can also see the impact, within the US and internationally, of 9/11. The battle lines are drawn. Al-Qaeda does not have the capacity to destroy the West, but it does have the capacity to mobilise for years to come. In Ariel Sharon and George Bush it has found two stalwart recruiting sergeants. More important still has been the consolidated rise of China. After five centuries when the Atlantic was the strategic and economic centre of the world, the focus has shifted to East Asia and the Pacific. This, not Iraq, is the dominant story of 2004. Last year marked the end of the interregnum following the end of the Cold War, the third chapter in the great European civil war in which the two world wars marked the initial two chapters. Yet this apparent distance between the contemporary world and the Cold War is delusory and dangerously so. The intellectual challenge is how to characterise this condition. We have had some grand, if preposterous, theories: the New World Order, the New Middle Ages, the End of History, the Clash of Civilisations, now the War Against Terrorism. In an attempt to comprehend the contemporary international system, this article proposes another narrative: the Three Dustbins Theory. The Three Dustbins Theory rests on the claim that, despite the receding of the Cold War, we remain, in key respects, prisoners of its legacy and will, unless we face up to these questions, remain so. As with all unacknowledged influences from the past, these repositories of conflict and myth are all the more powerful because unacknowledged. Dustbin Number One contains the legacies of the Soviet and communist periods. Among its contents are: an array of uncontrolled and unmonitored nuclear materials; a set of unresolved, sanguinary inter-ethnic problems inherited from the Soviet period - Bosnia, Kosovo, Transdniestr, Nagorno-Karabakh, Chechnya, Eritrea-Ethiopia - in all of which the costs of ethnic expulsion and fragmented government have provided a context for entrenched mafioso power; and the consolidation, in nearly all of the former Soviet Union and much of former pro-Soviet Africa (as in the Horn of Africa and Mozambique) of corrupt elites, a transition not to democracy but to post-Marxist kleptocracy. Most significant of all of these is the political character of the two most important states to have undergone the communist experiment: the neo-authoritarian dictatorship of Vladimir Putin in Russia, and the politically immobile dictatorship of the communist leaders in China. No transition to democracy here and none likely, not least because these two groups of rulers play the coquette to Washington in the matter of their 'wars' against Chechen and Sinkiang opponents. The Second Dustbin is that of the West, and the US in particular. One of the costs of winning the Cold War is that the West has failed to rethink its assumptions about the conduct of international relations. Instead, and above all with the Bush administration, we have seen the recycling, often by veterans of the confrontations with the Soviet Union in the 1970s, of policies that were as wrong then as they are now: the fabrication of threats, accompanied by dire warnings about how time 'is running out', about hostile states; the repetition ad nauseam of platitudes about the role of force in international affairs that no first-year student could get away with; a suspicion, if not disdain, for international institutions, notably the UN and international law; a facile, historically short-sighted and grossly exaggerated set of claims about how many states conform to an acceptable model of democracy (the 'Free World' of the 1950s and 1960s recycled). Of the cruel, and intellectually bankrupt, certainties of neo-liberalism, which has undermined the social provision and regulation roles of the state across the world, there is no need to say more. Meanwhile, US neo-conservative family planning policy, by blocking the use of contraception and abortion, is in league with the patriarch of St Peter's Square, condemning millions to avoidable death. However, the greatest, and least acknowledged, legacies of the Cold War on the Western side lie in two other domains. Here pervasive denial, compounded by self-righteous declamation, reign supreme. One such legacy concerns the origins of the terrorist threat itself: al-Qaeda and its like did not arise suddenly in 2001, or from the subconscious of the Islamic or Arab minds, but from the Cold War, in particular the financing, training and arming of tens of thousands of jihadi militants by the US, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan for the war in Afghanistan in the 1980s. That war was to the early 21st century what the Spanish Civil War was to the mid-20th, the devils kitchen in which the criminal practices later unleashed on the world were first brewed. It is the greatest, if not the only, solecism of Bush's anti-terrorist campaign that he is incapable, as is American public opinion as a whole, of recognising how far the US helped to prepare this movement, as it did the Unita murderers in Angola, the Contras in Nicaragua, and, at one remove, Renamo in Mozambique. The other, now more evident than ever, legacy of Cold War on the Western side is both simple and all-pervasive: the mental attitude accompanying the exercise of power over other peoples, and the discussion of it, by Washington, one predominantly of arrogance, ignorance and instinctive resort to force. This mindset, often decked out with frothing claims about 'imperial burdens' and 'grand strategy', was evident in the Cold War itself, not least in the grotesque continuation of a nuclear arms race over four decades, but also draws in the US, as it does in much of post-imperial Europe, on the unacknowledged cultural legacy of colonialism. The West has still not learnt to treat the rest of the world on an equal footing, a point most graphically illustrated by the photographs from Abu Ghraib: it is, above all, not because the victims were Muslim, Arab, or even non-white, but because they were from a subordinate people that they were subjected with such levity and sadism to their tortures. It might be thought prudent to stop the argument there, with a denunciation of the powerful in East and West. But the unacknowledged legacy of the Cold War does not stop there, and is equally to be found among those protesting against globalisation and meeting in Porto Alegre. The Third Dustbin is that of the contemporary global protest movement, to a considerable degree a children's crusade of intellectual demagogues, recycled 1960s bunkeristas with their fellow travellers in literary circles, dreamers and political manipulators, of the old and new lefts, whose claim to moral and analytic superiority too often masks a set of unexamined, and themselves often recycled, platitudes from the Cold War period and, indeed, from the ideology of the communist world. It is as if, having appeared to die in Moscow in 1991, the anti-capitalist world movement leapt from the coffin, like James Joyce's corpse Finegan at his Wake, at Seattle in 1999, having learnt nothing at all. Indeed the contents of this Third Dustbin are familiar enough: a ritual incantantion of 'no war' that avoids any substantive engagement with problems of international peace and security, or reflection on how positively to help peoples in zones of conflict; a set of vague, unthought out, uncosted and often dangerous utopian ideas about an alternative world; a pleasing but vapid invocation of global human values and internationalism that blithely ignores the misuses to which that term was put in the 20th century (for example by Stalin or Mao); a complacent attitude, innocent when not indulgent, towards political violence (witness the cult of Che Guevara, a cruel and dangerous man, and the invitees from Northern Ireland, Palestine and Iran, to name but three at the London Social Summit in October). This was a capitulation, that would have shocked their socialist forebears, to nationalist and religious bigots (as in the reception by the supposedly left-wing Mayor of London of Sheikh Yusif al-Qaradawi, the descendant of a line of Mus lim fascist thinkers). There is also a vapid and politically ineffective attitude to nature, forgetting, as the tsunami should have reminded all of us, that nature can also kill. And all of this is mixed up with a shallow, repetitive critique of globalisation, in the name of what we are never sure, and a naive, uninformed, analysis of the US. Such a critique applies, in the first place, to the Western and affiliated Third World protest movement. But it applies with even greater force to the murderous vapidities promulgated by the most prominent alternative centre of resistance, that of radical Sunni jihadism, be it of Bin Laden or al-Zarqawi: these people are devoid of any substantive ideas about how to run a modern society, economy or political system. Here is in essence the Three Dustbins Theory. That unchallenged ideas and political legacies take their toll was familiar to the wise of earlier times. Marx remarked that the legacy of past generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living. Keynes said that behind the ideas of every politician lay the thought of some dead economist. Freud warned us of the toll taken by the repressed. All would find much that is familiar in the world today. We can assess the outcome of discussions in Davos and Porto Alegre to see if thinking on the current crises of the world has moved on. Here ideas and policies should meet what I term the 'Vilanova Test', named after the flinty Spanish writer Pere Vilanova, who, on the basis of years of political engagement and debate in Spain and the Arab world, has argued consistently for pensamiento duro, 'tough thinking', in the contemporary world. We certainly have, and may again be treated to, plenty of the other. · Fred Halliday's 'The International Relations of the Middle East' (CUP) and 'One Hundred Myths About the Middle East' (Saqi) will be published in the spring",
        "debiased_text": "Last week, two separate gatherings took place: one in Davos, Switzerland, where global economic and political leaders convened, and another in Porto Alegre, Brazil, where groups opposed to globalization met. These events occurred as the international landscape has evolved significantly since the end of the Cold War 14 years prior. Discussions at these meetings reflected on several geopolitical developments, including the rise of China as a major economic and strategic force, shifting global focus toward East Asia and the Pacific. Additionally, the impact of the September 11 attacks on U.S. foreign policy and international relations was noted. A theoretical framework referred to as the 'Three Dustbins Theory' was proposed to analyze lingering Cold War influences on contemporary global issues. The theory identifies three categories: first, unresolved conflicts and governance challenges in former Soviet states and allied regions; second, the persistence of Cold War-era policies and attitudes in Western nations, particularly the U.S.; and third, critiques of the modern anti-globalization movement, which the theory suggests sometimes echoes ideological positions from past eras without substantive policy alternatives. The article concludes by suggesting that unresolved historical influences continue to shape global politics and that future discussions may benefit from critical analysis and pragmatic problem-solving approaches."

        "original_text": "China's clothing industry is marshalling its defences in the face of an anticipated backlash in the US and Europe against its growing exports, claiming a jump in sales in January was the artificial result of the end of the decades-old quota system. Cao Xinyu, vice-chairman of the China Chamber of Commerce for Import & Export of Textiles, said export growth was \"very normal in the global perspective\" and would stabilise in the longer term. China's apparel exports to the US grew by 41 per cent year on year in January after quotas were removed at the end of 2004. China's gains were much greater than those made by other countries benefiting from the liberalised system. \"The market for textiles will not become bigger just because of China,\" Mr Cao told the Financial Times. As a result, the US and Europe are likely to take steps to reimpose quotas on some categories of Chinese clothing imports. The US government said this week it would put in place a system for monitoring textile imports in order that so-called safeguard measures could be enacted more quickly. Under China's accession to the World Trade Organisation, importing countries can use \"safeguards provisions\" to re-impose quotas. US retailers have so far used the courts to block Washington from reimposing quotas. But Laura Jones, executive director of the US Association of Importers of Textile and Apparel, which represents big US retailers, said there would eventually be safeguards on China. \"The issue for the industry . . . is when.\" Mr Cao insisted some foreign companies such as Nike, the US footwear manufacturer, had backed the Chinese chamber in mounting a case in the US and Europe against new quotas. Unlike the US where the issue of clothing imports from China has pitted leading retailers against US textile companies, European retailers have so far not sought to counter pressure from the textile lobby for curbs on Chinese goods. Patrick Itschert, director general of ETUF-TCL, which represents EU employees in the textile, clothing and leather industries, said European retailers were more reluctant than their US counterparts to side openly with Chinese manufacturers and their lower labour standards. \"Retailers have the right to fight for the lowest prices but it is clear that, in a case like China, this can only be done at the expense of people (workers),\" he said. The Chinese government has already imposed a tax on textile exports to head off pressure from the US and Europe. \"They realise they are in for a hailstorm of anti-dumping cases and other actions,\" said Bill McCahill, a former US diplomat working for a law firm in Beijing.",
        "debiased_text": "China's clothing industry is responding to potential trade measures in the US and Europe following increased exports after the removal of quotas. According to Cao Xinyu, vice-chairman of the China Chamber of Commerce for Import & Export of Textiles, export growth in January was consistent with global trends and expected to stabilize over time. Data shows China's apparel exports to the US rose by 41% year-on-year in January 2005 after quota restrictions ended in late 2004. This increase was larger than that of other countries benefiting from the policy change. Cao stated that China's growth would not expand the overall global textile market. In response, US and European authorities are considering reintroducing quotas on certain Chinese textile imports. The US government announced plans to implement a monitoring system for textile imports to facilitate faster imposition of safeguard measures. These provisions, allowed under China's WTO accession terms, permit temporary import restrictions. While US retailers have previously prevented quota reinstatement through legal action, industry representatives suggest safeguards on Chinese imports are likely. Some foreign companies, including Nike, have reportedly supported the Chinese chamber's opposition to new quotas. In Europe, retailers have been less active than their US counterparts in opposing textile industry calls for import restrictions. The Chinese government has implemented an export tax on textiles amid trade tensions. Analysts note these developments occur as China faces potential anti-dumping cases."

        "original_text": "These days the word \"slow\" is not often paired in the same sentence with the famously roaring Chinese economy. Indeed, Beijing has been trying for two years to restrain the excesses of a country growing at the precipitous pace of 9.5 percent. Yet there are emerging signs that the campaign is starting to work. Inflation is slowing, particularly in go-go housing markets like Shanghai's, and for the steel that goes into so many of China's exports. Investment in roads and factories is cooling. When China's imports actually shrank in March, some economists predicted a drop in the growth rate, to as low as 7 percent. Analysts at RAND Corp. predict China will grow at a rate of 7 to 8 percent annually for the next five years. And Andy Xie of Morgan Stanley recently cited the \"dramatic\" slip in China's oil imports as one of the most visible signs that \"the China slowdown has begun.\"</P> The impact on the world would depend, of course, on the scope of the slowdown. China has emerged as not only the export factory to the world but also the second most important consuming nation after the United States: Chinese consumption now accounts for about 16 percent of world growth. China is now the fastest-growing export market for Asian economies and commodity-producing nations such as Australia and Brazil, says Goldman Sachs economist Fred Hu, and \"if China were to slow sharply, those countries would be hard hit.\" Hu thinks that's unlikely: the consensus forecast is for a growth slowdown of only three to seven tenths of a percentage point. Yet China is now such a big player, even symptoms of a slowdown can raise global tension: trade results released last week show that China's import growth is falling even as its export boom accelerates, boosting its trade surplus to a new high. That is going to complicate the efforts Beijing and the Bush administration are making to create a cordial atmosphere for Chinese President Hu Jintao's visit to Washington next month.</P> On balance most observers welcome evidence that China is retreating from a boom widely viewed as unsustainable. One of the most remarkable signs is the fall in China's demand for oil imports, which dropped 1.3 percent for crude and 21 percent for refined oil in the first half of this year. The price of oil hit a new record of $65.30 a barrel last week, but dipped after the International Energy Agency revised its estimate for the 2005 growth rate of China's oil demand from 7.9 percent down to 4.9 percent. Analysts say Beijing's campaign to boost power generation, most of it fueled by coal and other alternatives, could exert a restraining effect on oil prices. Whether that will happen is unclear, however. Oil markets, which had cited exploding Chinese demand as a major (if not the major) reason for record prices, keep finding new things to worry about.</P> Still, the sense is that China is making the right moves. Contrast, for example, China's apparently effective effort to reduce oil demand to the Bush administration's newly passed energy policy, which has done nothing to reduce U.S. demand. Consider, too, the contrasting approach to housing bubbles, which continue to loom in the United States as Washington watches from the laissez-faire sidelines, but are already shrinking in China, as Beijing slaps on rules to restrain lending and speculation. It's conceivable that if these trends end badly for the United States but well for China, other nations will begin looking more closely to Beijing-style state controls as a model.</P> As always, Beijing's concerns are mainly internal. By early this year, runaway real estate prices in Shanghai were producing horror stories of grooms forced to put off weddings because they could not afford places to live. A delegate at the March meeting of China's Parliament warned that \"the majority of citizens in many cities can't afford\" the skyrocketing prices. Since then, the imposition of new taxes and regulations has chilled house-price inflation: in July average residential-property prices in Beijing actually fell 3 percent.</P> In a recent report, Xie makes an intriguing case for why the slowdown lowers the threat of social instability. In recent years, he says, rising prices for necessities like food, energy and particularly housing had channeled money into the hands of business and government, and lowered the share of GNP that goes to households. China's property bubble directed wealth into the pockets of privileged \"insiders\" at the expense of the population, says Xie. Slowing growth is thus likely to raise the household share of GNP, by lowering prices to the benefit of low-income groups such as workers and farmers. Meanwhile, corporate profits are falling, which will slow the growth in China's income gap.</P> Central authorities are confident they can bolster the incomes of rural immigrants with ongoing efforts to improve social security, abolish peasant taxes and increase farm subsidies, says analyst Gao Huiqing of the State Information Center, a government think tank in Beijing. And more disposable cash will help unleash the pent-up \"consumer desires\" of this underclass, says Gao.</P> The irony is that Beijing's power to control the economy in the name of domestic tranquility makes China less predictable on the world stage. Its 9.5 percent growth comes with an inflation rate under 2 percent, which would be hailed as a miraculous achievement if Beijing did not still set prices in many sectors. Lately, Beijing has been reluctant to raise retail prices for gasoline, diesel and electricity in step with higher global oil prices--partly for fear of inflation and unrest. This has dampened energy imports and artificially stimulated exports. Chinese diesel exports are up 130 percent this year, defying expectations. The unseen hand of bureaucrats makes it tough to make forecasts based on market models, and recent swings in supply and demand were magnified by manufacturers stocking up on oil following last summer's brownouts. China's unpredictability \"screws up people's calculations totally,\" says Andy Rothman, an analyst at the CSLA brokerage house in Shanghai. \"Complexities like this can throw you completely off whack.\"</P> China certainly has Washington off kilter. For months the United States had urged China to revalue the yuan, which was pegged to the dollar at a rate that lowered the price of Chinese goods in the United States, and fed the trade imbalance. In late July, China said it would allow the yuan to rise and then float within a narrow range, but the currency rose only 2.1 percent--and has barely budged since. That suggests to some that this \"managed float\" is managed with a heavy hand, which will fuel calls for China to go further. Beijing says to do so threatens its stability. The debate continues to rage even as the Bush administration and Beijing are \"pulling out all the stops\" to ensure a smooth Hu visit, says Jason Kindopp at the Eurasia Group, a political-risk consultancy. In these conflicting winds, it will be hard even for Beijing to manage simultaneous soft landings for the economy and for Hu in Washington.</P>",
        "debiased_text": "Recent data indicates shifts in China's economic growth patterns. China's economy, which had been expanding at a rate of 9.5 percent, shows signs of moderation. Inflation rates have decreased, notably in housing markets such as Shanghai and in steel prices. March saw a contraction in imports, leading some economists to project a potential decrease in growth rates to approximately 7 percent. Analysts from RAND Corporation estimate annual growth of 7 to 8 percent over the next five years. Morgan Stanley's Andy Xie noted a decline in China's oil imports as a significant indicator of economic deceleration.\n\nThe global implications of China's economic changes depend on their extent. As a major consumer nation and export hub, China contributes about 16 percent of global growth. A sharp slowdown could affect export-dependent economies in Asia and commodity-producing countries like Australia and Brazil. Goldman Sachs economist Fred Hu suggests that growth is likely to slow by 0.3 to 0.7 percentage points. Recent trade data shows declining import growth alongside rising exports, leading to a record trade surplus that may impact diplomatic discussions ahead of Chinese President Hu Jintao's upcoming visit to Washington.\n\nChina's reduced demand for oil imports—down 1.3 percent for crude and 21 percent for refined oil in the first half of the year—has influenced global oil prices. The International Energy Agency revised its 2005 estimate for China's oil demand growth from 7.9 percent to 4.9 percent. Beijing's focus on increasing coal-powered energy generation may also affect oil markets.\n\nDomestically, measures to address rapid real estate price increases in Shanghai and other cities have shown effects, with Beijing's residential property prices declining by 3 percent in July. Analyst Andy Xie suggests slower growth could redistribute income toward households, potentially reducing social inequality. Government efforts to enhance rural welfare, abolish agricultural taxes, and increase subsidies aim to support low-income groups.\n\nChina's economic policies remain centralized, with price controls in place for sectors like fuel and electricity. These measures have affected energy imports and exports, complicating market-based projections. Analysts note difficulties in predicting supply and demand due to state interventions and past stockpiling behaviors.\n\nOn currency policy, China announced a 2.1 percent revaluation of the yuan in July, with limited movement since. This has led to debate over further adjustments, with Beijing citing stability concerns. Diplomatic preparations continue for President Hu Jintao's Washington visit amid discussions on trade and economic policy."

        "original_text": "SHANGHAI -- China showed signs of alleviating a politically sensitive gasoline crunch, as emergency deliveries arrived in wealthy southern cities to placate private car owners angry about long lines to buy fuel. After days of acute shortages, several fuel stations in Guangzhou and Shenzhen yesterday reported an improvement both in supply and in the temperament of customers. Some stations, which had run out of gasoline earlier this week, were back in business; others no longer were rationing their fuel. \"Many gas stations have been refilled, so the crowds have dispersed,\" said Chen Maofang, chief attendant at the Nonglin Gas Station in downtown Guangzhou. Ms. Chen said traffic police and public security were managing much shorter lines. China's fuel crunch emerged abruptly, underscoring how integral the automobile is becoming to the middle-class Chinese consumer. The rise in private automobile ownership is putting fresh strains on a government already struggling to feed its economy with enough fuel to sustain growth. Chinese officials have blamed the shortages on a recent typhoon that disrupted shipments of crude oil to refineries. But refineries have been partly to blame for the shortages, too, as they have exported precious stock abroad, where they can command higher prices than they could get at home. During the past several months, Beijing has been bumping government-controlled fuel prices higher, though only gradually to keep a lid on inflation. Early this week, agitated consumers in Guangzhou and Shenzhen waited in line for as long as three hours. Sporadic protests erupted when some gas stations tapped out and suspended operations. By midweek, shortages spread to eastern China and parts of northern China, drawing comparisons to the oil crisis that hammered the U.S. economy in the 1970s. Although the gas crunch appeared to catch officials off guard, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Shanghai officials quickly put in for emergency deliveries. Guangzhou now is receiving a guaranteed daily oil supply of 10,000 tons, said Chen Yunze, spokesman for the city's Economic and Trade Commission, which is in charge of relieving the fuel shortage. \"The situation is getting better every day,\" Mr. Chen said. Most of the police who had been keeping order at the gas stations, he added, have left. --- Ellen Zhu contributed to this article.",

        "original_text": "AS CHINA GRAPPLES with angry trading partners on issues such as export and currency imbalances and intellectual-property piracy, Beijing's point man brings a range of skills to the bargaining table -- but little experience in the trade arena. Chinese Commerce Minister Bo Xilai, who has spent most of his career as a successful administrator at local levels, faces perhaps his toughest professional challenge yet: going head-to-head with the U.S. and European Union at a time when trade tensions seem to be growing daily. Mr. Bo and his ministry must contend with rising frustration in the U.S. and Europe over China's surging textile exports, its unwillingness to revalue its currency and widespread piracy of foreign intellectual property, such as bootlegging movies and software and appropriating trade secrets. From China's steps so far, Mr. Bo's inexperience in trade issues has been telling, some analysts say. \"It has been a tough learning experience,\" said Ma Xiaoye, a former Chinese trade official who now heads the Academy for World Watch, a Shanghai think tank. Another test for Mr. Bo arrived yesterday in the form of a U.S. trade delegation led by Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez, whom Mr. Bo is scheduled to meet tomorrow. Yesterday, at the start of his first visit to Beijing since taking office four months ago, Mr. Gutierrez said that while disputes over textiles exports draw much attention, it is critical that China make progress on intellectual-property infringement. Failure to do so, he suggested, could spark a trade war; both governments face mounting domestic pressure. Intellectual-property protection resonates with a swath of U.S. businesses, and is tied to trade-deficit concerns because fake, inexpensive goods in China may be precluding imports of authentic products. Intransigence by Beijing could prompt Washington to impose punitive duties, hurting Chinese exporters in their biggest market and many China-invested U.S. companies. If \"there's one thing I'm asking the Chinese government for, it's help, because we're both going to be at risk,\" Mr. Gutierrez said. U.S.-Chinese relations took another hit following Beijing's decision Monday to scrap voluntary tariffs on some textile exports after the U.S. and the EU moved to restrain imports of certain types of Chinese- made garments. During a news conference Monday, the usually affable Mr. Bo charged the U.S and EU with being \"unfair\" and \"protectionist.\" Attempts to interview Mr. Bo for this article were unsuccessful, as he has been traveling. To some extent, the 56-year-old Mr. Bo serves more as a coordinator of trade policy, with the most important decisions made by officials at higher levels, including Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice Premier Wu Yi, who formerly ran the trade ministry and whom Mr. Gutierrez also will meet. But Mr. Bo's media savvy and ability to learn quickly suggest that his influence in trade issues will continue to grow, analysts say. His first year on the job hasn't been entirely successful. Many industry analysts had predicted Chinese garment exports would face curbs this year following the end of a global quota system as of January. And many people, including executives in China's apparel industry, say Mr. Bo's agency could have effected a smoother transition. Mr. Bo's ministry voluntarily introduced export duties in January meant to slow a flood of Chinese garments into global markets. But the levies were low and failed to achieve their aim, resulting in moves by the U.S. and EU to restrict Chinese textile imports. The Commerce Ministry then announced last month that it would introduce much higher voluntary export tariffs -- increasing rates as much as fivefold -- only to announce it was scrapping many of the duties 10 days later. The ministry said it did so because of retaliatory moves by the U.S. and EU, but Lu Jinyong, a trade professor with Beijing's University of Business and Economics, said the turnabout spooked markets and suggested a lack of strategy. A former senior U.S. trade negotiator said China's actions suggested Chinese authorities were \"not paying attention\" to rising anti-China sentiment in the U.S. and Europe. \"Chinese negotiators are not as keyed in to U.S. and European politics in a way that would be helpful to China,\" the former trade official said. Still, few think Mr. Bo isn't up to the task. In the year since he has taken office, he has loosened regulations on Chinese companies investing overseas, which led to a rise in Chinese foreign investment by 27% to $3.6 billion in 2004. He has advanced free-trade negotiations with Association of Southeast Asian Nations members and defused tensions with the EU over Beijing's decision early last year to limit coal-coke exports, which roiled steel markets. Mr. Bo's ministry reached an agreement with the EU to lift the restrictions in mid-2004. Prof. Lu praised Mr. Bo's pragmatic stance in the negotiations, saying, \"He knows when to make compromises and when to stand hard.\" Mr. Bo earned his stripes as mayor of the northeastern port city of Dalian in Liaoning province. During his seven-year tenure, he won praise for luring foreign investment and converting the city into a green haven with wide, tree-lined streets. Mr. Bo, who dresses in sharply cut suits, surrounded himself with capable administrators and -- rare for a high-level Chinese official -- appeared to value their opinions, even when they differed from his own. He also gained a reputation as a micromanager. Mr. Bo was promoted to Liaoning governor in 2001. His rise up the political ladder was relatively slow, with some attributing that to a Western-style penchant for the limelight -- a trait that doesn't always sit well with more-reserved Chinese leaders. Soon after taking the helm at the Commerce Ministry in 2004, Mr. Bo circulated a 15-point memo designed to strengthen internal management. According to the memo, all talks with foreign guests must be recorded and a printed transcript submitted to Mr. Bo within two hours, ministry employees say. He also requires that all senior ministry officials be reachable by cellphone around the clock, they say. Nonetheless, Mr. Bo is credited with streamlining his agency's bloated bureaucracy. The ministry was set up in 2003 by merging the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the State Economic and Trade Commission, effectively combining China's equivalent of the U.S. Trade Representative's Office and the Commerce Department. The agency's first minister became terminally ill soon after being appointed, resulting in little progress until Mr. Bo took charge. Increasingly, Mr. Bo's charisma is seen as an asset in a world where China increasingly must respond to allegations of unfair trade practices by its trading partners, analysts say.",
        "debiased_text": "China is engaged in trade discussions with partners regarding export and currency imbalances, as well as intellectual property protections. Chinese Commerce Minister Bo Xilai, whose background is primarily in local administration, is now involved in these negotiations with the U.S. and the European Union as trade tensions persist. The U.S. and EU have raised concerns over China's textile exports, currency valuation, and intellectual property infringement, including piracy of movies, software, and trade secrets. Some analysts note Bo Xilai's limited prior experience in trade negotiations. A U.S. trade delegation led by Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez arrived to discuss these matters, with intellectual property protection highlighted as a key issue. Gutierrez suggested that insufficient progress could lead to trade tensions. Recent moves by China to adjust textile export tariffs have drawn mixed reactions, with some industry observers noting market uncertainty. Bo Xilai's ministry has also worked on policies such as easing overseas investment regulations, which led to a 27% increase in Chinese foreign investment in 2004, and negotiating trade agreements with ASEAN and the EU. Before his current role, Bo Xilai served as mayor of Dalian, where he was recognized for urban development and attracting foreign investment. Since becoming commerce minister, he has implemented administrative reforms within the ministry, including stricter documentation of meetings and increased accessibility of senior officials. Analysts note Bo Xilai’s growing role in trade discussions as China addresses international trade concerns."

        "original_text": "Remember when the Internet was going to change the world? In those heady days, some believed that downtown business districts faced extinction because anything a local business did, an online provider would soon do better and cheaper.\nThis fantasy evaporated, of course, along with the stock-market bubble that fueled it. Today the Internet is just another reality of daily life. But that shouldn't make us forget that it still has plenty of capacity to change our lives.\nToday's lack of excitement is partly because we've become used to some of the past decade's revolutionary changes, such as widespread e-mail and the fact that online shopping and bargain travel reservations have produced multi-billion-dollar industries in North America.\nHowever, it's also true that the Internet's mushrooming growth did come to a screeching halt.\nThe number of Internet users in the world's dominant market, the U.S, stagnated in both 2002 and 2003, according to market researchers at Ipsos-Insight in New York City.\nBut it turns out that this was just a pause. Internet growth re- ignited last year, with the number of adult users surging by 27 per cent.\nThat's probably because the belated expansion of broadband service in the U.S. is finally making it easy for large numbers of people to do in real life the cool things - like listening to Internet radio, downloading music and sending digital pictures to friends - that we've been reading about for years.\nA survey late last year found that for the first time ever, more than half of the 162 million adult Internet users in the U.S. are using broadband - tech talk for high-speed - Internet connections, says Neil Modi, senior research manager at Ipsos-Insight.\nCanada, perhaps because this country has a higher percentage of homes wired for cable TV, is actually ahead of the U.S. in this respect, with about two-thirds of us enjoying broadband service.\nThe implications of broadband are multiple, and some are far from intuitively obvious.\nFor example, Internet use is less confined to youths. Rapid growth in music downloading from sites like Apple Computer's iTunes is fueled largely by users older than 50, notes Modi.\nHe speculates that with illegal downloads replaced by law- abiding outfits like Apple and Microsoft and with demand driven by soaring sales of iPods and other MP3 players, the technology has become respectable, enabling older users to focus on the cost- effectiveness of buying only those tunes you really want.\nEven more popular than downloading is simply listening to music, which becomes understandable once you discover the wide variety of tastes represented among Internet radio stations.\nThe emergence of digital cameras as a hot consumer product is another new driver of Internet use. For the first time, it's easy and nearly instantaneous to share snapshots with friends and family anywhere.\nIn coming years, we're facing another exciting transformation, as the cultural diversity of the Internet experiences a quantum shift, with huge numbers of users pouring onto the Net from Asia.\nAlready, the second-biggest population of Internet users is in Japan, some 70 million of them. As well, the proportion of heavy users - those who stay online more than 11 hours a week - is highest in Japan, South Korea and China's urban centres.\nThe fastest-growing Internet markets are China and Russia, each with only about 10 million users now, but both having grown by more than 50 per cent last year.\nIndia, the largest country in the world where English is spoken widely, should be catching up.\nLike China and other countries with a less-developed telephone network, India will avoid the expense of wiring its cities and just skip straight to wireless access. India's cell phone network, which is increasingly used for Internet access, is one of the world's fastest growing and this pace will continue for several years, Modi believes.\njbryan@thegazette.canwest.com",
        "debiased_text": "In the past, there were expectations that the Internet would significantly transform the world. Some believed local businesses might decline as online providers offered cheaper and more efficient alternatives. These predictions coincided with the stock-market bubble, which later burst. Today, the Internet is a routine part of daily life, but its potential for further impact remains. \n\nPrevious revolutionary changes, such as widespread email and the growth of online shopping and travel reservations, have become normalized. However, the rapid expansion of the Internet slowed at one point. Market researchers at Ipsos-Insight reported stagnation in the number of U.S. Internet users in 2002 and 2003. Growth resumed in the following year, with adult users increasing by 27%. \n\nThis resurgence may be linked to the expansion of broadband services, which enabled more users to engage in activities like streaming Internet radio, downloading music, and sharing digital images. According to Neil Modi, senior research manager at Ipsos-Insight, a late 2004 survey indicated that over half of the 162 million adult Internet users in the U.S. had broadband connections. Canada, with a higher rate of cable TV infrastructure, has about two-thirds of its population using broadband. \n\nBroadband adoption has broader implications. For instance, Internet usage is no longer predominantly among younger individuals. Data suggests that music downloads, particularly from platforms like Apple's iTunes, are increasingly popular among users over 50. Modi posits that the legality of services like iTunes and the rising popularity of MP3 players may have contributed to broader adoption. \n\nListening to Internet radio is also growing, partly due to the variety of available content. Additionally, the rise of digital cameras has facilitated easier and faster photo-sharing online. \n\nLooking ahead, the Internet is expected to see further demographic shifts, with increasing users from Asia. Japan currently has the second-highest number of Internet users globally, about 70 million, with high proportions of heavy users in Japan, South Korea, and China’s urban centers. China and Russia are among the fastest-growing markets, each expanding by more than 50% in the previous year. India, with its English-speaking population and expanding wireless networks, is also poised for growth. Modi suggests that India’s rapid cell phone network expansion will further drive Internet accessibility."

        "original_text": "The World Bank yesterday said China should revalue the renminbi and abandon the dollar peg in favour of a link to a basket of currencies. It warned that without a revaluation speculative capital flows could destabilise economies in the region. The bank, which has long called for greater currency flexibility in China and across developing Asia, also said Malaysia should let its currency appreciate. Homi Kharas, the bank's chief economist for the region, said there was no imminent risk of a financial crisis caused by currency speculators, like that in the late 1990s, but \"very large volumes of money\" flowing into the region threatened economic distortions. He suggested that China link its currency to a foreign exchange basket. \"It's really a question of timing, and timing depends on circumstances,\" he said. Shifting the peg to a basket of the dollar, yen, euro and other currencies might also help defuse growing protectionist pressures in the US. Finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised economies have increased the pressure on China to move immediately towards a more flexible currency regime - though Japan has cautioned about outside interference. Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China, said at the weekend that foreign pressure might accelerate Beijing's so far undisclosed timetable to introduce greater exchange rate flexibility. But Mr Zhou gave no indication of when any change to the exchange rate might come. The World Bank predicted that economic expansion in east Asia, excluding Japan, would slow to 6 per cent this year from 7.2 per cent in 2004 because of sluggish global demand, higher oil prices and efforts to curb China's rapid growth rates. The bank predicted China would achieve a \"soft landing\", with the economy's growth expected to slow to 8.3 per cent this year and 7.5 per cent in 2006 from 9.5 per cent in 2004. But Mr Kharas admitted that the bank remains \"gun shy\" about its forecast. \"In China, the authorities will need to find a way to make domestic assets more expensive for foreigners. In other countries, there is room to expand investment and consumption to counter slowing world demand,\" said Mr Kharas. The recent lifting of quotas on textile exports from China, however, would probably increase China's trade surpluses in the short term, contributing to the world's \"sizeable\" economic imbalance. The region had a chance to undertake more structural reforms in the financial sector and capital markets, since high economic growth rates after 2001 have meant stronger finances for local governments, banks and companies. The bank underscored that growth remained uneven across Asia. But regional economies were achieving more balanced growth as increased consumer spending and investments reduced dependence on exports.",
        "debiased_text": "The World Bank stated that China should consider revaluing the renminbi and moving away from its dollar peg to link its currency to a basket of currencies. The bank noted that without such adjustments, speculative capital flows might affect economic stability in the region. It also recommended that Malaysia allow its currency to appreciate. Homi Kharas, the bank's chief economist for the region, indicated that while there is no immediate risk of a financial crisis similar to the late 1990s, large capital inflows could lead to economic distortions. He proposed that China consider pegging its currency to a basket of currencies, emphasizing that timing would depend on economic conditions. A shift to a basket including the dollar, yen, and euro could also address protectionist concerns in the U.S. Finance ministers from the Group of Seven nations have urged China to adopt a more flexible currency regime, though Japan has cautioned against external pressure. Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People's Bank of China, suggested that external pressure might influence Beijing's undisclosed timeline for exchange rate adjustments but did not specify when changes might occur. The World Bank projects that economic growth in East Asia, excluding Japan, will slow to 6% in 2024 from 7.2% in 2004, citing weaker global demand, higher oil prices, and efforts to moderate China's growth. China's growth is expected to decrease to 8.3% in 2024 and 7.5% in 2006, down from 9.5% in 2004, with the bank acknowledging some uncertainty in its forecast. Kharas noted that China may need to adjust policies to manage foreign investment, while other regional economies could boost domestic demand to offset slowing exports. The removal of textile export quotas is expected to raise China’s trade surplus temporarily, contributing to global economic imbalances. The bank highlighted opportunities for structural reforms in regional financial sectors, given improved fiscal conditions since 2001. It also observed that while growth remains uneven in Asia, rising consumer spending and investment are reducing reliance on exports."

        "original_text": "The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday September 11 2005 In the article below, we said: 'Abortions, at 17.8 for every 1,000 women, are at a record high.' Those 2004 figures, supplied by the Department of Health, relate to women aged between 15 and 44 only. This summer, I met a man who was about to be cloned. His skin cells were to be sent to South Korea, where scientists would inject his genetic material into human eggs. Stem cells from the resulting embryos would then be sent back to British experts hoping to find a cure for motor neurone disease. The man I met is dying. He may have only a year or two to live and any breakthrough will come too late for him. By volunteering to be one of the first Britons to be copied, he wants to help save others. But he is young and cannot give up hope, so he did something else. Though he is far from rich, he paid £12,500 to travel across the world for a treatment so unproven that his consultant, who has no links with the clinic in question, warned him that the chance of any improvement was, at best, 3 per cent. The therapy failed, but he thought the risk worthwhile. What else could he have done, this man caught in the gap between scientific marvels still to come and a remedy hardly more reliable than the application of leeches? Welcome to the biotech century, in which scare stories about runaway science are balanced by trudging progress. Last week, the government announced the first shake-up in legislation since the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act of 1990 set the ethical framework for a generation. The new discussion agenda includes 'saviour' siblings, allowing social sex selection and human-animal hybrids. Already, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis means embryos can be screened for fatal diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and Huntington's. Ever since the first test-tube baby was born, in 1978, the UK has been a world leader. That makes it all the odder that some changes have seemed so slow. The Warnock committee decided, long ago, that embryos could be used for experiments for up to 14 days. The beginning of human life, it argued, was an ethical rather than a biological question. Years on, ethics trump biology in less desirable ways. Just after the government announced its consultation, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority allowed a clinic to select embryos lacking the gene that can trigger eye cancer in children. This was either a godsend or, to pro-lifers, another possible shortcut to bio-hell. 'What's the hurry?' asks Josephine Quintavalle of Comment on Reproductive Ethics (Core), as if parents at risk of having sick children had all the time in the world. Earlier this year, in a test case involving the Hashmi family, Core lost its battle to ban 'saviour' siblings created to help treat a brother or sister with a potentially fatal genetic disorder. The House of Lords ruled the procedure lawful, but the case should never have got so far. Individuals, and doctors, who want to save or enhance life should not have their reasonable dreams crushed by lobbyists seeking to impose a private credo. That is not, though, an argument against all regulation, especially on social selection. As Lord Winston argues, it will soon be simple to choose a child's sex, but that does not mean 'family balancing' has to be legalised, against the wishes of around 80 per cent of people. If accessibility is the test, we might as well concede that Iran must have the nuclear bomb. Nor should the West embrace policies it deplores elsewhere. In India and China, cheap sonograms and abortions have so skewed the ratio of male to female that the deficit of girls in Asia has been estimated at 100 million. There is a third reason to be wary. Any treatment based on whim rather than health provokes the argument that Britain is opening the floodgates on designer babies. This mantra is so well-worn that you might expect the nurseries of Hampstead to be full of particle physicists in nappies. Except that there is no Mozart gene or get-into-Oxbridge gene, only the web of biology and background that no eugenicist could hope to deconstruct. The fertility debate should provoke anxiety, but that concern should hinge not on the imaginary children of the future. It should centre on the babies we are having, or not having, in Britain 2005.The baby boom of the late 1980s has given way to an ageing population and a fertility rate of 1.79 children. Abortions, at 17.8 for every 1,000 women, are at a record high. The mistaken clamour to lower the top limit of 24 weeks rumbles on, partly because ever younger babies are being kept alive. Too few ask whether it is ethical to force life on premature children who may be gravely damaged, or why the old and sick are compelled to endure hideous lives they no longer want. There is no proper compass on who should live or who may die. The state is rarely to be found by an incubator or at a deathbed. And yet, in assisted fertility, it is the most officious regulator imaginable. Last week, a minister made clear that NHS fertility treatment is to be strictly for the two-parent, heterosexual family. Such social engineering would be thought sinister if it applied to any other branch of reproduction or any other state provision. It also ignores both the make-up of the modern family and the particular problems of today. The youngish mothers of 1990 have been replaced by older women. In caricature, they are sad, old Bridget Joneses, weeping into their pregnancy-testing kits or wishing men were as effective sperm providers as Michael Buerk imagines. In reality, many women who want children have left it too late. Along with other factors, such as obesity, that has created an infertility crisis so acute that one in three women may need IVF or similar treatment by 2015. Meanwhile, the government has abandoned a target of three IVF cycles on the NHS. Instead, former Health Secretary John Reid promised one. That would give most women a meagre conception chance of roughly 20 per cent, if the directive worked. But as few as one in five primary care trusts is providing one free cycle and many women face a two-year wait. What future can there be for high-tech science when people are denied the breakthroughs of long ago? Far from inhabiting a post-ethical age, we are in a limbo where ethics have become either the morality of the religious right or a synonym for rationing. In that climate, available treatments get labelled a luxury and so-far undiscovered cures dismissed as perilous. Both should be seen as a birthright of a society that believes in science and its own future. The guiding principle has to be humanity. Take human clones, the modern spectre. The man I met this summer did not believe in reproductive cloning, only the therapeutic sort. He had no Raelian vision of a world of simulacra or think, like George Bernard Shaw, that perfectibility was no bad goal. In common with the 1,200 Britons who will die of motor neurone disease this year, he simply wanted not to have to waste away as death closed in. It seemed a reasonable aim. mary.riddell@observer.co.uk",

Recent government proposals have suggested updates to legislation following the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act of 1990. The discussions include topics such as 'saviour' siblings, social sex selection, and human-animal hybrid research. Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis is currently used to screen embryos for genetic conditions like cystic fibrosis and Huntington's disease. The UK has been a leader in fertility treatments since the birth of the first test-tube baby in 1978. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority recently permitted a clinic to select embryos lacking a gene linked to childhood eye cancer. Josephine Quintavalle of Comment on Reproductive Ethics questioned the pace of such developments. Earlier this year, a legal case involving the Hashmi family resulted in the House of Lords ruling that creating 'saviour' siblings for medical treatment is lawful. Debate continues regarding regulations, particularly around social selection. Some argue against legalizing sex selection for non-medical reasons, citing concerns about potential gender imbalances observed in other countries. Current UK fertility rates stand at 1.79 children per woman, with abortion rates at 17.8 per 1,000 women aged 15-44. Discussions persist about the 24-week abortion limit. NHS fertility treatment policies currently prioritize two-parent heterosexual families, though demand for treatment has increased among older women. Projections suggest one in three women may require IVF or similar treatments by 2015. The government has reduced its NHS IVF provision target from three cycles to one, with limited availability across primary care trusts."

        "title": "World briefing: Japan emerges as America's deputy sheriff in the Pacific",
        "original_text": "Escalating tension with China, violently illustrated by renewed anti-Japanese protests in Shanghai and other big cities at the weekend, is increasing pressure on Tokyo to expand its military capabilities and back a deepening strategic alliance with the US reaching from east Asia to the Gulf. Japan's pacifist postwar constitution restricts its armed forces to self-defence. About 50,000 US troops in Okinawa and other bases guarantee the country's security in return for a $5bn (£2.6bn) Japanese cash contribution. But defence analysts say the perceived Chinese threat, a more assertive, nationalistic Japanese mindset, and Washington's wish to use Japan as a command post for operations extending to the Middle East are transforming Japan's formerly semi-detached defence posture. In other words, after 60 years largely spent keeping its head down, Japan appears destined to supplant Australia as Washington's \"deputy sheriff\" in the Asia-Pacific region and become a pillar of America's 21st-century security architecture. According to Kazuya Sakamoto of Osaka University, Japan and Britain are central to a far-reaching, post-9/11 US review of its overseas force deployments. \"The basic idea is that the US will gradually withdraw from the Eurasian landmass while assigning the two island nations at the east and west of Eurasia, Japan and Britain, even greater importance as strategic bases to ensure stability in Europe and Asia,\" Professor Sakamoto writes in the current issue of Japan Echo magazine. An important element in this transformation fell into place last week when Japan agreed in principle to allow the command headquarters of the US Army's 1st Corps to transfer from Washington state, on the US Pacific coast, to Camp Zama, near Yokohama, south of Tokyo. The 1st Corps has responsibility for operations in the Pacific and Indian oceans, extending to the conflict zones and oilfields of the Gulf. The primary focus of its forward deployment is likely to be the defence of Taiwan, regional challenges posed by China's military expansion, and the nuclear standoff with North Korea. But the US has also reportedly proposed that command operations of the 13th Airforce, now on Guam in the Pacific - a base for long-range bombers and tanker aircraft frequently deployed in the Middle East - be moved to Yokota airbase in Tokyo. \"The ramifications of this would be that Japan would essentially serve as a frontline US command post for the Asia-Pacific and beyond,\" said Christopher Hughes of Warwick University in a paper published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The American forward deployments are certain to be viewed with suspicion in China and farther afield - and face political opposition in Japan. The US-Japan security treaty states that US bases may only be used \"for the purpose of contributing to the security of Japan and the maintenance of international peace and security in the far east\". It says nothing, for example, about Iran. But Dr Hughes said that since Japan had given the US a free hand to use its bases for previous Middle East operations, Tokyo \"might have to accept its enhanced role as a fulcrum for US military commands\". Japan's worries about China are the main reason for acquiescing in US plans that effectively shatter any remaining pacifist illusions. But Tokyo is in any case growing more militarily assertive under its prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi. Japan sent non-combat troops to Iraq while its navy has joined the US-led Proliferation Security Initiative. Military cooperation with Australia, South Korea and south-east Asian states is developing. It is acquiring a ballistic missile defence system and new satellite intelligence capabilities. It has pledged to help keep the peace in Taiwan. And there has even been talk of pre-emptive strikes against North Korea and a Japanese nuclear deterrent. In short, Japan, emerging from the shadow of its past, is again becoming a military power with a global role and hopes of a permanent UN security council seat. China's actions may thereby be more easily explained. But further demonstrations of hostility will only exacerbate the slide towards an Asian cold war.",
        "debiased_text": "Recent anti-Japanese protests in Shanghai and other major Chinese cities have coincided with discussions in Tokyo about expanding Japan's military capabilities and strengthening its strategic alliance with the United States. Japan's postwar constitution limits its military to self-defense roles. Approximately 50,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Okinawa and other bases, with Japan providing $5 billion annually in support. Defense analysts note that changing regional dynamics, including China's military activities, Japan's evolving security policies, and U.S. strategic interests in East Asia and the Middle East, are influencing Japan's defense strategy. A recent development includes Japan's agreement in principle to relocate the U.S. Army's 1st Corps command headquarters from Washington state to Camp Zama near Tokyo. The 1st Corps oversees operations in the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions. Discussions have also included potential relocations of U.S. Air Force command operations to bases in Japan. These developments may affect Japan's role in regional security under the U.S.-Japan security treaty, which specifies the use of U.S. bases in Japan for regional peace and security. Meanwhile, Japan has increased its military cooperation with other nations, participated in non-combat operations in Iraq, and enhanced its defense systems. These actions coincide with Japan's broader strategic considerations, including discussions about regional security challenges and potential roles in international frameworks."

        "title": "WITH DOLLAR FALLING, FOREIGN BUYERS PURSUE US FIRMS AS DOLLAR FALLS, FOREIGN ; BUYERS GET US FIRMS AT BARGAIN PRICES: [THIRD EDITION]",
        "original_text": "Foreign buyers are capitalizing on the weak dollar to snap up US companies at bargain-basement prices, boosting investment in high- tech regions like New England but also fueling concerns about jobs and technology flowing out of the country.\nAs foreign visitors on holiday prowl for deals on Newbury Street, their countrymen in the corporate world are bargain hunting on Route 128 and other high-tech boulevards. Eighty-seven New England companies were acquired last year by foreign buyers, taking advantage of their stronger currency to buy American technology on the cheap. That was up from the 82 businesses in the region sold to foreign companies in 2003 and the 72 in 2002, according to the Thomson Financial research firm.\nA similar increase can be seen nationally. If the dollar slides further, as many economists expect, the trend is likely to accelerate.\n\"It's a no-brainer,\" said Nicholas S. Perna, an economist in Ridgefield, Conn. \"The dollar has fallen 33 percent against the euro over the last three years. What that does is make it vastly cheaper for foreigners to buy our assets. It's just like they're walking into Filene's Basement and finding out everything's 25 or 35 percent off.\"\nThe purchases are bringing new capital into the region and kindling economic activity, in some cases creating new jobs. They are also providing entrepreneurs and their backers with a new avenue to cash out of their investments.\nBut at a time that many are alarmed by the acquisitions of home- grown giants such as Gillette Co. and FleetBoston Financial Corp. by out-of-state buyers, the international deals raise the specter of corporate control shifting not only to Cincinnati and Charlotte, N.C., but also to Canada, Germany, and India. And some free-trade critics fear that other countries will seek to bolster their research and development by buying American technology firms, to the detriment of the US economy.\n\"They'll buy up our technology, incorporate it in their products, and use it to compete against our products,\" said William R. Hawkins, senior fellow at the US Business and Industrial Council trade group.\nOthers defend the acquisitions. \"The global economy is a two-way street,\" said Nancy McLernon, deputy director of the Organization for International Investment, which represents 125 US subsidiaries of foreign corporations. \"Foreign companies do come here, and they employ 5.4 million Americans . . . in many of these cross-border acquisitions is there is often less duplication and less of a potential for layoffs than there is in domestic acquisitions.\"\nWhen surgical instrument maker Microline Inc. of Beverly went on the market last year, bids came from Europe and Asia. Microline ultimately was sold to the Japanese conglomerate Pentax Corp. for $48 million in December. That same month in Massachusetts, search engine marketing firm iProspect of Watertown was bought by a British company, biopharmaceutical Eukarion Inc. of Bedford by an Australian suitor, and transportation and energy company Solectria Corp. of Woburn by a buyer from Canada.\nThe IBM Corp. agreement in December to sell its personal computer business to China's Lenovo Group for $1.75 billion set off global reverberations not felt in the business world since Germany's Daimler-Benz AG acquired Chrysler Corp. in 1998. But despite the blockbuster IBM-Lenovo deal, now being scrutinized by US regulators worried about national security implications, the bulk of the foreign acquisition targets have been small and midsize businesses, many of them technology start-ups backed by venture capital firms.\n\"Foreign companies want US technology and access to US markets,\" said Elliot Williams, president of Mirus Capital Advisors, a Burlington investment bank. \"This is a large market, and they can get into it relatively cheaply now. And they can watch how technologies take off in the US a year and a half before they're rolled out in Europe.\"\nLast year, 1,126 businesses in the United States were sold to foreign companies, up from 1,032 in 2003 and 980 in 2002, the Thomson Financial figures indicate.\nDennis J. White, an attorney specializing in mergers and acquisitions at the law firm McDermott Will & Emery in Boston, said New England has seen a higher share of foreign deals than other regions and is emerging as a US \"gateway\" for overseas companies.\n\"New England is a significant spawning ground for new technology,\" White said. \"Foreign companies view this region, along with Silicon Valley, as places where they can acquire technology they can use in their operations worldwide. Boston is also seen as the most European city in the US and an easy segue into the American market.\"\nThe now-mighty euro is not the only foreign currency that has risen against the US dollar. In the past three years, Canada's dollar has climbed 22 percent against it, while the British pound has gained 25 percent. Aegis Group PLC, the London-based advertising and marketing giant that scooped up iProspect, has bought four other US companies in the past 18 months as part of a global expansion strategy. While companies here were once seen as prohibitively expensive, the dollar's decline has offset the high costs, said Nigel Morris, president of Aegis Isobar Worldwide division.\n\"A deal's got to make financial sense, and it's got to make strategic sense,\" said Morris, who estimated half of his 18 business trips across the Atlantic last year were related to acquisitions. \"But we also look at whether there's tools and technologies that can be transferred around our global network. That transfer of intellectual property is key.\"\nSuch transactions do not sit well with Hawkins at the US Business and Industrial Council, who worries that passing technology into foreign hands could drain jobs, damage the US economy, even pose a military threat. Hawkins said American regulators should interpret national security concerns more broadly to stem the overseas flow of dual-use technologies, which have civilian and military applications.\nBut many ambitious US entrepreneurs see an acquisition by an overseas buyer as a plus, giving their home-grown companies a global platform. Fredrick Marckini, the iProspect founder who is staying on as chief executive after the Aegis acquisition, said the financial resources, marketing muscle, and international reach of his new corporate parent will propel a worldwide expansion.\nFor venture capitalists, who bankroll the often risky start-ups that are fountains of American innovation, the increasing overtures from Europe, Asia, and Canada promise more exit opportunities for their portfolio companies and a better chance for the venture firms and their limited partners to cash out of their investments profitably. The foreign shopping spree also may boost merger activity by US companies fearful of giving their international competitors a foothold here.\nBryce Youngren, a principal at Polaris Venture Partners in Waltham, said his firm has been seeing more foreign interest in buying Polaris-backed companies. If the dollar continues to slide, he thinks, that will become a more common exit scenario.\n\"The dollar is absolutely a factor,\" Youngren said. \"Europeans are starting to think about the level of the dollar.\"\nRobert Weisman can be reached at weisman@globe.com.",

Examples include Microline Inc., sold to Japan's Pentax Corp. for $48 million, and iProspect, acquired by a British firm.

Dennis J. White of McDermott Will & Emery noted New England's prominence in such deals, attributing it to the region's technology sector. Currency fluctuations, including the euro's rise, have facilitated these transactions. Opinions on the trend vary, with some expressing concern over technology transfer and others highlighting benefits like job creation and market expansion. Fredrick Marckini of iProspect cited advantages in global reach post-acquisition. Venture capitalists observe increased foreign interest in US startups, which may lead to more exit opportunities."

        "title": "Press review: What they said about the week in Iraq",
        "original_text": "The new Iraqi government was sworn in on Tuesday against a backdrop of another wave of insurgent attacks. The latest violence in a week of bloodshed saw at least 60 Iraqis killed in a suicide bombing at a police recruitment centre in the Kurdish city of Irbil yesterday. The historic formation of a cabinet \"came not with a bang, but a shrug\", said Fawaz Turki in the Saudi Arab News. \"Many Iraqis, especially democrats weary of a government that derives its legitimacy from ethnic representation, and that has excluded all former Ba'athists ... are concerned over whether Iraq is headed toward civil war and whether the new prime minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, can summon the vision to avert disaster.\" \"Each of Mr Jaafari's faltering steps towards achieving national unity,\" said John R Bradley in the Singapore Straits Times, \"has been matched by the leaps and bounds of the insurgents.\" The violence - in all its forms - had made Iraq \"a living hell for many of its long-suffering people\", said the Financial Times. Civil war, warned the South China Morning Post, remained \"a very worrying possibility\". Missing from the cabinet sworn in this week were a handful of permanent ministerial appointments earmarked for the minority Sunnis - most important among them, observers agreed, being the defence portfolio. Sunni nominees had been vetoed by Shias \"because of [their] alleged Ba'ath party past\", explained Trudy Rubin in the Philadelphia Inquirer. The test of \"whether calmer Shia heads have prevailed\", she said, \"will be whether a respectable Sunni is found to head the defence ministry. Soon.\" \"The hope still is that by bringing credible Sunni figures on board, the government may be able to start winning political ground away from the insurgents,\" said the Qatar-based Gulf Times. But \"by prolonging the wrangling\", it added, \"it is the Iraqis who stand to lose. They ... can ill afford to lose any further.\" For the New York Post columnist Amir Taheri, however, delays did not necessarily mean failure. Instead, he suggested, they \"should be regarded as a positive sign that the new Iraqi leadership is learning the art of power-sharing\".",
        "debiased_text": "The new Iraqi government was sworn in on Tuesday amid ongoing insurgent attacks. On the same day, a suicide bombing at a police recruitment center in Irbil, a Kurdish city, resulted in at least 60 Iraqi fatalities. The cabinet formation included some unresolved appointments, particularly positions designated for Sunni minorities, such as the defense minister role. Sunni candidates reportedly faced rejections due to alleged ties to the former Ba'ath party. Observers noted concerns about potential delays in forming a fully inclusive government. Some analysts suggested that including credible Sunni figures could help counter insurgent influence. Others viewed the extended negotiations as a sign of efforts toward power-sharing."

        "title": "The beauty products from the skin of executed Chinese prisoners",
        "original_text": "A Chinese cosmetics company is using skin harvested from the corpses of executed convicts to develop beauty products for sale in Europe, an investigation by the Guardian has discovered. Agents for the firm have told would-be customers it is developing collagen for lip and wrinkle treatments from skin taken from prisoners after they have been shot. The agents say some of the company's products have been exported to the UK, and that the use of skin from condemned convicts is \"traditional\" and nothing to \"make such a big fuss about\". With European regulations to control cosmetic treatments such as collagen not expected for several years, doctors and politicians say the discovery highlights the dangers faced by the increasing number of Britons seeking to improve their looks. Apart from the ethical concerns, there is also the potential risk of infection. MPs on the Commons select health committee are to examine the regulatory system and may launch an investigation and question ministers about the need for immediate new controls. \"I am sure that the committee will want to look at this,\" said Kevin Barron, its Labour chairman. \"This is something everyone in society will be very concerned about.\" Plastic surgeons are also concerned about the delay in introducing regulations to control the cosmetic treatments industry. Norman Waterhouse, a former president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said: \"I am surprised that we are taking the lead from the European commission, because this is bound to delay action on this important area which is increasingly a matter for concern. It seems like a bit of a cop out to me.\" It is unclear whether any of the \"aesthetic fillers\" such as collagen available in the UK or on the internet are supplied by the company, which cannot be identified for legal reasons. It is also unclear whether collagen made from prisoners' skin is in the research stage or is in production. However, the Guardian has learned that the company has exported collagen products to the UK in the past. An agent told customers it had also exported to the US and European countries, and that it was trying to develop fillers using tissue from aborted foetuses. Traditional When formally approached by the Guardian, the agent denied the company was using skin harvested from executed prisoners. However, he had already admitted it was doing precisely this during a number of conversations with a researcher posing as a Hong Kong businessman. The Press Complaints Commission's code of practice permits subterfuge if there is no other means of investigating a matter of public interest. The agent told the researcher: \"A lot of the research is still carried out in the traditional manner using skin from the executed prisoner and aborted foetus.\" This material, he said, was being bought from \"bio tech\" companies based in the northern province of Heilongjiang, and was being developed elsewhere in China. He suggested that the use of skin and other tissues harvested from executed prisoners was not uncommon. \"In China it is considered very normal and I was very shocked that western countries can make such a big fuss about this,\" he said. Speaking from his office in northern China, he added: \"The government has put some pressure on all the medical facilities to keep this type of work in low profile.\" The agent said his company exported to the west via Hong Kong.\"We are still in the early days of selling these products, and clients from abroad are quite surprised that China can manufacture the same human collagen for less than 5% of what it costs in the west.\" Skin from prisoners used to be even less expensive, he said. \"Nowadays there is a certain fee that has to be paid to the court.\" The agent's admission comes after an inquiry into the cosmetic surgery industry in Britain, commissioned by the Department of Health, pointed to the need for new regulations controlling collagen treatments. Sir Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer, has highlighted the inquiry's concerns about the use of cadavers for cosmetic treatments. \"Cosmetic procedures are a rapidly growing area of private health care,\" he said. \"We must ensure we properly protect patients' safety by improving the training and regulation.\" The DoH has agreed to the inquiry's recommendations, but is waiting for the European commission to draw up proposals for laws governing cosmetic products. It could be several years before this legislation takes force. Meanwhile, cosmetic treatments, including those with with aesthetic fillers, are growing rapidly in popularity, with around 150,000 injections or implants administered each year in the UK. Lip enhancement treatments are one of the most popular, costing an average of £170. Some fillers are made from cattle or pig tissue, and others from humans. The DoH believes that there may be a risk of transmission of blood-borne viruses and even vCJD from collagen containing human tissue. Although there is as yet no evidence that this has happened, the inquiry found that some collagen injections had triggered inflammatory reactions causing permanent discomfort, scarring and disfigurement. In their report, the inquiry team said that if there was a risk, \"action should be taken to protect patient safety through regulation\". While new regulations are to be drawn up, the department is currently powerless to regulate most human-tissue fillers intended for injection or implant, as they occupy a legal grey area. Most products are not governed by regulations controlling medical products, as they are not classified as medicines. They also escape cosmetics regulations, which only apply to substances used on the surface of the skin and not those injected beneath it. The Healthcare Commission is planning new regulations for cosmetic surgery clinics next year, but these will not control the substances used by plastic surgeons. Hand transplants A number of plastic surgeons have told the Guardian that they have been hearing rumours about the use of tissue harvested from executed prisoners for several years. Peter Butler, a consultant plastic surgeon and government adviser, said there had been rumours that Chinese surgeons had performed hand transplants using hands from executed prisoners. One transplant centre was believed to be adjacent to an execution ground. \"I can see the utility of it, as they have access and no ethical objection,\" he said. \"The main concern would be infective risk.\" Andrew Lee of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, who has visited China to examine transplant techniques, said he had heard similar rumours. Manufacturers of aesthetic fillers said they had seen Chinese collagen products on sale at trade fairs, but had not seen any labelled Chinese-made in the UK. Dan Cohen, whose US-based company, Inamed, produces collagen products, said: \"We have come across Chinese products in the market place. But most products from China are being sold 'off-label' or are being imported illegally.\" In China, authorities deny that prisoners' body parts are harvested without their consent. However, there is some evidence to suggest it may be happening. In June 2001, Wang Guoqi, a Chinese former military physician, told US congressmen he had worked at execution grounds helping surgeons to harvest the organs of more than 100 executed prisoners, without prior consent. The surgeons used converted vans parked near the execution grounds to begin dissecting the bodies, he told the house international relations committee's human rights panel. Skin was said to be highly valued for the treatment of burn victims, and Dr Wang said that in 1995 he skinned a shot convict's body while the man's heart was still beating. Dr Wang, who was seeking asylum in the US, also alleged that corneas and other body tissue were removed for transplant, and said his hospital, the Tianjin paramilitary police general brigade hospital, sold body parts for profit. Human rights activists in China have repeatedly claimed that organs have been harvested from the corpses of executed prisoners and sold to surgeons offering transplants to fee-paying foreigners. Dr Wang's allegations infuriated the Chinese authorities, and in a rare move officials publicly denounced him as a liar. The government said organs were transplanted from executed prisoners only if they and their family gave consent. Although the exact number of people facing the death penalty in China is an official secret, Amnesty International believes around 3,400 were executed last year, with a further 6,000 on death row. What is it? Collagen is a major structural protein found in abundance in skin, bones, tendons and other connective tissue. Matted sheets of collagen give skin its toughness and by winding into molecular \"cables\", it adds strength to tendons. What is it used for? Collagen injections are used in cosmetic surgery to plump up lips and flatten out wrinkles. After botox, collagen injections are the second-most popular cosmetic operations in Britain. Collagen does not have a permanent effect and several injections are often needed. What else is it good for? Collagen was being put to good use as far back as the stone age. Neolithic cave dwellers around the Dead Sea are believed to have used it as a primitive form of glue some 8,000 years ago. More recently, researchers have developed a form that can be poured or injected into wounds to seal them. Where does it come from? A number of sources. Some companies extract it from cow skin and treat it to minimise the risk of allergic reactions or infection. Others collect it from human donors or extract cells from the patient before growing the necessary amount in a laboratory. Is it safe? Collagen can cause allergic reactions if it has not been treated correctly, and there is a theoretical risk of disease being passed on. A small amount of collagen is often injected into the skin a few weeks before treatment to test for possible allergic reactions. Earlier this year, Sir Liam Donaldson warned that collagen injections could spread conditions such as hepatitis and variant CJD, the human form of mad cow disease.",
        "debiased_text": "A Chinese cosmetics company is reportedly developing beauty products using collagen sourced from human skin, according to an investigation by the Guardian. Company agents stated that some of these products have been exported to the UK and other countries, though the company cannot be named for legal reasons. The agents described the sourcing of skin from executed prisoners as a traditional practice and mentioned ongoing research involving tissue from aborted fetuses. When contacted by the Guardian, an agent denied the use of skin from executed prisoners, despite earlier admissions in conversations with an undercover researcher. The agent claimed the material was sourced from biotech companies in Heilongjiang province. The UK Department of Health has acknowledged the need for regulations on collagen treatments, as highlighted by a recent inquiry, but awaits proposals from the European Commission. Concerns include potential risks of infection and transmission of blood-borne diseases, though no incidents have been confirmed. The inquiry also noted reports of inflammatory reactions from some collagen injections. Currently, human-tissue fillers fall into a regulatory gray area in the UK. Plastic surgeons interviewed by the Guardian mentioned rumors about the use of tissue from executed prisoners in China for medical procedures, including hand transplants, though no direct evidence was provided. Chinese authorities deny harvesting body parts without consent, but past allegations, such as those made by former military physician Wang Guoqi in 2001, contradict this claim. Amnesty International estimates that China executed approximately 3,400 people in the most recent available data, with 6,000 on death row. Collagen, a structural protein used in cosmetic and medical applications, is sourced from various materials, including cattle, pigs, and human donors. The UK Healthcare Commission plans to introduce new regulations for cosmetic surgery clinics next year, but these will not cover the substances used in procedures."

From this experience the young girl gained an appreciation for Asian flavors. She also saw herbs, spices, peanuts, and pineapples growing. Until then, she says, she didn't know that the fruits grow \"upside down.\" To this day she'd rather visit a farmers' market than a movie theater.\nThe COO of a Boston-based nonprofit organization, Kelso spends a lot of time cooking. \"It's the number one way I show people I love them,\" she says.

        "title": "MoD plans multibillion upgrade of nuclear subs",
        "original_text": "THE government is considering spending billions of pounds upgrading Britain's nuclear defences, replacing ageing missile systems with new submarines and brand new weapons from America. Ministry of Defence officials are drawing up plans which will be presented to ministers in the next two years. A range of options is being considered but ministers are believed to favour developing new, smaller, more advanced submarines, possibly equipped with long-range cruise missiles to succeed the Trident missile system, chosen by the Thatcher government in 1980. Cruise missiles have become a key part of the Royal Navy's arsenal in recent years and have been used in anger in Afghanistan and Iraq. However, the British nuclear deterrent currently depends on the older Trident missile system. At a time when nuclear proliferation is a major international issue - with pressure being put on Iran and North Korea to abandon what Western intelligence services believe are military nuclear weapons production programmes - any modernisation of the UK's nuclear weapon delivery systems will be controversial. Analysts say Britain, along with the other four declared nuclear powers of America, France, China and Russia, is not abiding by 'the spirit or the letter' of the 35-year-old nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which is up for review in May. 'The treaty depends on everyone moving towards nuclear disarmament. If you haven't got weapons you don't try and get them. If you have, you work towards giving them up,' said Nigel Chamberlain, of the British American Security Information Council. 'Upgrading nuclear weapons is not helpful. It sends all the wrong messages.' At present, the Royal Navy has four Trident submarines. Replacing them will cost up to £10 billion. Nuclear weapons systems also cost millions each year to maintain and, if based on submarines, require a small fleet of other vessels to protect them when deployed. Although no official date has been set, Admiral Sir Alan West, Britain's most senior sailor, recently told a conference on maritime power that the decision on replacing the Trident subs is expected within the next three years'. Building new subs, possibly equipped with cruise missiles with a nuclear payload, allows Britain to further mirror US strategic doctrines. The US Navy is converting some of its own Trident missile sub marines into 'multi-mission vessels' fitted for tactical strikes and support of covert special-operations forces. They will also be armed with tactical cruise missiles, rather than the unwieldy ballistic nuclear weapons. Deployment of Britain's Trident submarines, which replaced the increasingly unreliable Polaris fleet, started 15 years ago. The subs had a projected 30-year service life time, though retired naval officers say that could be extended by up to 10 years. Construction programmes take about 15 years, so a decision on their replacement will have to be taken within the next Parliament, according to a recent parliamentary white paper. The government has been tight-lipped about any nuclear revamp. At a Defence Select Committee last March, Sir Kevin Tebbit, the permanent secretary at the MoD, said simply that: 'The conditions for complete and gen eral global nuclear disarmament are not yet met.' When Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, was asked by MPs to comment on the nuclear defence options available, he refused. Hoon sparked concern among campaigners by refusing to rule out the use of a nuclear weapon in the run-up to the war in Iraq. There are also concerns that the current US administration's interest in using nuclear weapons tactically could provoke renewed interest in nuclear arms. Supporters say such technology, which is still unproven, is needed because 'rogue states' tend to protect their nuclear production facilities by burying them deep underground. The Ministry of Defence confirmed that a decision on Trident was likely to be needed 'in the next Parliament' but said that options would be kept open until then. 'Our minimum nuclear deterrent capability currently represented by Trident is likely to remain a necessary element of our security. Any decisions are based on what is in the best interests of the UK and international security,' the spokesperson said.",
        "debiased_text": "The UK government is evaluating potential upgrades to the country's nuclear defense systems, including replacing aging missile systems with new submarines and weapons from the United States. Ministry of Defence officials are preparing plans to be presented to ministers within the next two years. Among the options under consideration are new, smaller submarines, possibly equipped with long-range cruise missiles, as successors to the Trident missile system adopted in 1980. The Royal Navy has incorporated cruise missiles into its arsenal in recent years, deploying them in Afghanistan and Iraq. The UK's current nuclear deterrent relies on the Trident system. This review of nuclear weapon delivery systems occurs amid international discussions on nuclear proliferation, including Western pressure on Iran and North Korea regarding their nuclear programs. Analysts note that the UK, along with the U.S., France, China, and Russia, faces scrutiny under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which requires signatories to work toward disarmament. The Royal Navy maintains four Trident submarines, with replacement costs estimated at up to £10 billion. Annual maintenance and support operations for nuclear weapons systems also entail significant expenses. Admiral Sir Alan West recently stated that a decision on replacing Trident submarines is expected within three years. The U.S. Navy is adapting some of its Trident submarines for multi-mission use, including tactical strikes and special operations support, armed with cruise missiles rather than ballistic nuclear weapons. The current Trident fleet, which replaced Polaris submarines 15 years ago, has an estimated service life of 30-40 years. A recent parliamentary white paper indicated that replacement decisions must be made in the next parliamentary term due to lengthy construction timelines. Government officials have provided limited public comment on nuclear modernization. In March 2005, MoD Permanent Secretary Sir Kevin Tebbit remarked that conditions for global nuclear disarmament had not been met. Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon declined to discuss specific nuclear defense options when questioned by MPs, having previously not ruled out nuclear weapon use before the Iraq War. Some analysts suggest U.S. interest in tactical nuclear weapons could influence international nuclear policy. The MoD confirmed that Trident replacement decisions would likely be required in the next parliamentary term, with all options remaining under consideration until then. A ministry spokesperson stated that maintaining a minimum nuclear deterrent through Trident remains necessary for UK and international security, with decisions based on national interests."

        "original_text": "A bilateral agreement between Pakistan and China, signed on Tuesday in Islamabad, proved both countries are \"among the key players who are playing a major role in the emerging world order\", according to Taimur-ul- Hassan in the Statesman. \"Even though friendship and cooperation between Pakistan and China ... is decades old, the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Good Neighbourly Relations takes their relationship to a higher stage,\" said Dawn, which highlighted China's \"clear and unambiguous\" assurances to defend Pakistan's \"sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity\". The treaty was a triumph for the government of President Pervez Musharraf, said the Islamabad Daily Mail: \"We should be proud of the fast-expanding co-operation with China ... which, in the words of Gen Musharraf, is deeper than oceans and higher than mountains.\" The Nation noted the different attitudes to Pakistan of China and the US. \"The US has generally relied on Pakistan to do its bidding every now and then to meet its strategic objectives in the region, while cultivating India for the long term, in return for which Pakistan has been given little more than economic pats on the back,\" it said. China, on the other hand, \"has engaged Pakistan more positively\". Thus Gen Musharraf \"is justified in laying emphasis on taking ties with China to new highs\". Just before the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, arrived in Pakistan - the first stop of his South Asian tour - to sign the treaty, Gen Musharraf unveiled another result of Sino-Pakistani cooperation, the JF 17 Thunder fighter aircraft. The previous day, Islamabad and Beijing signed an agreement for Pakistan to construct four frigates for the Chinese navy. Such joint ventures, said the Nation, show \"China has not yet become a superpower; it still needs help from its friends like Pakistan.\" China Daily hailed the latest stage in the \"'all-weather' strategic partnership\" between the two countries, saying Mr Wen's visit would bring \"new vigour\" to it. \"Sino-Pakistani relations have become an exemplary model for China's good-neighbourliness and diplomacy,\" added the paper.",

Dawn noted that the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Good Neighbourly Relations builds upon long-standing ties between the two countries, with China offering assurances regarding Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Islamabad Daily Mail reported that President Pervez Musharraf's government viewed the treaty as an achievement, referencing Musharraf's statement about the depth of Pakistan-China relations. The Nation compared the approaches of China and the US toward Pakistan, observing that China has engaged with Pakistan in joint projects, while the US has primarily pursued strategic objectives in the region with Pakistan's assistance. Prior to Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's arrival in Pakistan to sign the treaty, Musharraf presented the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft, a product of bilateral cooperation. Additionally, an agreement was signed for Pakistan to construct four frigates for the Chinese navy. China Daily referred to the visit as reinforcing the 'all-weather' strategic partnership between the two nations."

Then there was an inspection of the troops on parade and awards from the commanding officers. Aleksandr Minakov reports. [Minakov, over video of helicopters, aircraft, paratroops, armoured vehicles, captioned as Weibei test range, China] The final stage of the exercise: a sortie by airborne assault troops in the rear of the notional enemy. Russian and Chinese assault troops played their parts right on cue. There were just two weeks of intensive training to work out joint actions but this was quite enough for them. The defence ministers of Russia and China announced the end of the military exercise. Russian airborne assault troops are all contract servicemen. During this exercise they were entrusted to try out the latest firearms developments in practice. The main thing, though is a new radio station which enables assault troops to communicate with one another even in the air. [Sergey Novikov, captioned as deputy platoon commander] This is a long-distance radio station with a range of 1,300 metres, it's light and convenient. It's a lot lighter, see the receiver here. I can switch it off and on easily [words indistinct]. [Correspondent] The defence ministers today expressed thanks to all who took part in the exercise, and gave out awards, too. The large-scale Russo-Chinese exercise, the ministers stressed, demonstrated the strategic partnership of the two sides. But Russia and China are not planning to set up a military bloc, as a number of countries fear. [Sergey Ivanov, Russian defence minister, in uniform] We are not setting up any military blocs. And has already been stated unambiguously, this exercise is not directed against anybody or against any state. [Correspondent] Another question which many foreign observers are asking is why strategic bombers were used in exercises directed against terrorism. [Ivanov] Tu-95, and, incidentally Tu-160, aircraft are capable of carrying high-precision, long-range non-nuclear weapons. Using this sort of weapon against terrorists, to neutralize major terrorist bases and places where they are massing, is in fact very expedient. [Correspondent, over video of troops marching, military band playing] The first joint exercise by the Russian and Chinese armies has been a bright page not only in the history of the two countries. This is a big event first and foremost for every soldier and officer, both Chinese and Russian.",

Japan has also asked for compensation for damage to its embassy in Beijing after thousands of demonstrators stoned the building for several hours. Tokyo said the Chinese authorities could have done more to stop the stoning, though officials acknowledged that massed police had probably prevented a storming of the embassy itself.

        "original_text": "Voltaire declared more than two centuries ago that history was \"nothing more than a tableau of crimes and misfortunes\", but rarely hasthe representation of those crimes been the cause of as much bitterness as it is today between Japan and China. The controversy over Japanese school textbooks - which are denounced in Beijing for glossing over Japanese atrocities during the 1931-1945 occupation - has been an essential source of outrage in fuelling the recent anti-Japan demonstrations across China. Japan's distorted version of its history, the Chinese say, is an insult to the victims of Japanese imperialism and a good reason not to grant Tokyo a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. Many Japanese, including government officials, admit that their history is deficient, and leftwingers say they are ashamed of some of the textbooks issued in the past few years by nationalistic publishing houses. Japan, however, is not the first country to promote a rosy view of its own imperial history. Nor has there been an inexorable decline in the truthfulness of Japanese publications. Jeff Kingston, professor of history and director of Asian studies at Temple University in Japan, says Japanese textbooks briefly became more realistic about history after Emperor Hirohito died in 1989. Before that, certain subjects, such as Japan's infamous vivisection experiments on Chinese prisoners, had been virtually taboo. \"In the mid-1990s, history in the media became much more progressive and previously taboo topics began to trickle through into textbooks,\" says Prof Kingston. \"But that provoked a backlash with people saying: 'Why are we engaging in this masochistic history?' That led to the call for a narrative that Japan was liberating the Asians.\" In 2001, Fusosha, a rightwing publisher, put out a textbook aimed at restoring pride in Japanese history. Less than 1 per cent of school boards took up the textbook. But its version of history - which omits mention of \"comfort women\" and glosses over the Nanjing massacre - has begun to influence the textbooks approved this month. Some politicians and academics in Japan believe the country has been subjected to victors' justice, which has stripped it of the right to interpret its own history. \"How dare people interfere in what we write in our textbooks?\" asks one government official. Japan, he added, would never dare poke its nose in, say, the US history curriculum. For those seeking graphic - if not necessarily balanced - accounts of Japanese infamy, there is no better place to look than China. China History, the textbook used for 13- to 15-year-old pupils of the country's middle schools, devotes more than a page to the Nanjing massacre alone, with photographs of Japanese soldiers preparing to decapitate and bayonet Nanjing youths. \"The Japanese invaders were everywhere, burning, killing, raping and pillaging, stopping at nothing in their wickedness,\" the book says. But China's schoolbooks, carefully edited to ensure they do not contradict the official historical verdicts of the ruling Communist party, have their own conspicuous absences. Texts for middle and upper school students give great detail about the party's resistance against Japanese oppression, but gloss over or ignore most of its less glorious moments. The brutal 1989 suppression of pro-democracy protests centred on Beijing's Tiananmen Square is ignored. China's brief but bloody 1979 invasion of Vietnam does not merit a mention; nor does the 1959 Tibetan rebellion and flight into exile of the region's religious ruler, the Dalai Lama. Perhaps the biggest omission is any discussion of the human toll taken by Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward, when the Great Helmsman tried to fast-forward economic development but instead helped cause a famine estimated to have killed 30m-40m people. Japanese officials complain that China's view of north-east Asian history is also distorted by Beijing's failure to acknowledge the peaceful coexistence between Japan and China for the past 60 years or the fast-growing economic relationship between the two. Few nations can proudly hold up their history textbooks and proclaim them to be the unvarnished truth, but analysts say Japan's failure to be as honest as Germany about its war record has given Chinese leaders an opportunity that they have ruthlessly exploited. \"By not pursuing reconciliation, Japan has handed China a hammer that is far too easy to use for a Communist leadership with declining legitimacy,\" says Prof Kingston.",
        "debiased_text": "Disputes over historical interpretation in Japanese school textbooks have contributed to tensions between Japan and China. Some Chinese officials and citizens criticize the textbooks for omitting or downplaying events during Japan's occupation of China from 1931 to 1945. These criticisms have coincided with recent protests in China. Some Japanese government officials and scholars acknowledge shortcomings in historical education, while certain publishers have produced textbooks with nationalist perspectives. Approximately 1% of Japanese school districts adopted a 2001 textbook by Fusosha that omitted references to comfort women and provided minimal detail about the Nanjing massacre.\n\nIn China, middle school textbooks include detailed accounts of Japanese wartime actions, with specific attention to the Nanjing massacre. Chinese textbooks align with government-approved historical narratives but do not cover certain domestic events such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War, the 1959 Tibetan uprising, or the casualties during the Great Leap Forward.\n\nJapanese officials note that Chinese textbooks do not emphasize the peaceful relations and economic cooperation between Japan and China in recent decades. Historical scholars observe that nations often present selective historical narratives, and differences in textbook content remain a point of diplomatic discussion between the two countries."

        "original_text": "Projections by a leading U.S. manufacturing group show China's global trade surplus quadrupling this year, which it says will add pressure on China to further revalue its currency. China's surplus with the world could hit $140 billion, up from $32 billion last year, according to a new report by the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a policy-research group in Arlington, Va. China's trade surpluses with the U.S. have ballooned in recent years, though its overall trade picture has remained relatively stable with moderate surpluses. The shift toward a fast-growing global surplus means more countries are likely to step up pressure on China to do something about it. \"That doesn't mean the Chinese will succumb, but the pressure is definitely growing,\" said Todd Lee, a China specialist at Global Insight, an economic-forecasting and -consulting firm in Lexington, Mass. Many manufacturers in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere contend an undervalued yuan is the crux of the problem. Indeed, U.S. political pressure over the past two years is widely viewed as the main reason China revalued the yuan on July 21, pushing it 2.1% higher against the dollar. But critics insist that was too little. Some analysts predicted China would undertake a second, more sizable adjustment in the yuan before Chinese President Hu Jintao's visit next week to the U.S., where he is to meet with President Bush. However, earlier this week a top Chinese central banker appeared to rule out an abrupt adjustment in the currency before the meeting. \"We've had a big deficit with China for several years,\" but a similar pattern is emerging elsewhere, such as in China's trade with Europe, said Ernest Preeg, senior fellow in trade and productivity at the Manufacturers Alliance and author of the report. The Alliance, whose members include large manufacturers, many with significant operations in China, previously had said it believed the yuan was undervalued. Mr. Preeg found that China's global trade position surged from a deficit of $6.8 billion in the first half of last year to a surplus of $39.6 billion in the first half of 2005. A country-by-country analysis shows 77% of this increase is accounted for by trade with the U.S. and the European Union. There are signs of growing friction with the EU, including a dispute now raging over a surge of Chinese garment imports that the Europeans have blocked because they exceed the limits set by a June quota agreement. Other economists also are predicting a surge in the Chinese surplus this year, but not as big. Nicholas Lardy, senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, is projecting a surplus of $100 billion to $110 billion. The main reason for the ballooning surplus, he said, is a slowdown in the growth of China's imports. \"There's been a slowdown primarily in the import of investment goods and, to some extent, in energy and raw materials,\" he said.",
        "debiased_text": "A report by the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a policy-research group based in Arlington, Virginia, projects that China's global trade surplus may rise to $140 billion this year, up from $32 billion in the previous year. The report suggests this could lead to increased international pressure on China to adjust its currency valuation. China's trade surplus with the U.S. has grown in recent years, while its overall trade balance has remained relatively stable with moderate surpluses. According to Todd Lee, a China specialist at Global Insight, an economic forecasting firm in Lexington, Massachusetts, while pressure may increase, it does not guarantee China will implement further currency adjustments. Some U.S. and European manufacturers argue that an undervalued yuan is a key factor in trade imbalances. In July 2021, China adjusted the yuan's value by 2.1% against the dollar, a move some analysts attributed to U.S. political pressure. However, critics viewed the adjustment as insufficient. Earlier this week, a senior Chinese central bank official indicated no immediate currency adjustments would occur before Chinese President Hu Jintao's upcoming visit to the U.S., where he is scheduled to meet with President George W. Bush. Ernest Preeg, a senior fellow at the Manufacturers Alliance and the report's author, noted that while the U.S. has maintained a trade deficit with China for several years, similar trends are appearing in China's trade with Europe. The report highlights that China's global trade balance shifted from a $6.8 billion deficit in the first half of 2024 to a $39.6 billion surplus in the first half of 2025, with 77% of the increase attributed to trade with the U.S. and the European Union. Tensions with the EU have risen, including disputes over Chinese garment imports exceeding agreed quotas. Other economists, such as Nicholas Lardy of the Institute for International Economics, predict a smaller surplus of $100 billion to $110 billion, citing slower growth in China's imports, particularly investment goods, energy, and raw materials."

        "original_text": "SHANGHAI -- The world's fastest growing large economy has just gotten nearly 17% bigger. China said it has recalculated the size of the country's economic output for 2004 to better reflect the activity of consumers, as opposed to manufacturers. The impact is that China's gross domestic product was 16.8% larger in 2004 than previously figured. China, therefore, ranked as the sixth largest global economy last year instead of seventh, moving ahead of Italy but holding behind France. The new figure for 2004 GDP is 15.988 trillion yuan, or about $1.931 trillion based on the exchange rate then, compared with 13.688 trillion yuan as calculated under the previous method, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The main difference is that China relied on consumer activity and services for 40.7% of national economic output last year, compared with just 31.9% as previously reported. The change is the result of the statistics department's first economic census. A bigger services economy means China's economy is healthier than previously thought because it relies less on manufacturing and exports. It also is richer per capita. Plus, the bigger size of the economy suggests China is more efficient in allocating investment, which based on the old statistics had reached worrying levels. Yet officials were quick to play down the impact of the new figures, expressing a keen awareness of how China's fast economic rise is creating political waves overseas and pushing up global commodity prices. \"It's only an error in the total number (for GDP) . . . there is no fundamental change of the total picture,\" said Li Deshui, director of the statistics bureau, during a televised news conference. \"Problems and complications are still there,\" Mr. Li said. He noted that China continues to struggle to boost consumer demand and has \"a long way to catch up\" to developed economies like the U.S. where the service sector is 75% of the GDP.",

The adjustment follows China's first economic census. Statistics bureau director Li Deshui stated that the revision reflects an update in GDP figures but does not signify a fundamental change in the overall economic situation.

        "title": "Unlicensed GM rice may be in UK food chain",
        "original_text": "Unlicensed GM rice sold illegally on the internet to Chinese farmers has been sold for human consumption and may have been imported undetected into the UK, even though it could cause allergic reactions. The Chinese authorities are investigating after 11 samples of rice in Hubei province were found to contain BT rice, a transgenic strain that has not been approved for commercial growing and should not be in human food. The UK is one of a number of EU countries that imports rice from China. Although the amount of GM rice involved is thought to be only a small percentage of the total grown - about 1,200 tonnes - no one knows precisely, or where it went. Since no GM rice is grown legally anywhere in the world, importers would not have checked if any had entered British food supplies. The GM rice was discovered after Greenpeace China investigated offers on the internet to farmers of GM rice that would kill larvae which bore into the stalks of the crop, seriously damaging yields. The rice has not been tested for human consumption, but it caused an allergic reaction in mice when fed to them. Apart from a potential risk to human health, the poison genetically engineered into the plant could also kill non-target species such as butterflies and moths. Insects which are or become resistant to the introduced toxin may evolve and require more intensive chemical control. There are also fears that the rice could contaminate natural genetic resources and affect long-term soil health. For China it is also an economic risk, because importer countries such as Japan and Korea have consumers who reject GM foods. A similar GM contamination case in the US in 2000 resulted in a $1bn (£530m) product recall, amid concerns of potential allergenic reactions after illegal, genetically engineered corn called StarLink entered the food chain. Although StarLink was grown on less than 1% of all US cornfields, it was mingled with much larger quantities of corn. It resulted in the recall of nearly 300 contaminated food product lines. The Chinese rice contamination was discovered when researchers followed up the internet sales and collected samples of rice from millers and merchants. Testing by the Genescan international laboratory found that 11 samples were contaminated, and two contained toxins which were known to cause an allergic reaction in mice. Sarah North, the GM campaigner for Greenpeace, said: \"This dodgy rice could have serious consequences for human health and the environment and it could already be on UK supermarket shelves. This is just another sorry example of how the GM industry is out of control.\" The discovery of the GM rice followed a scandal last month over unlicensed GM maize entering the food chain as a result of a mix-up between two types of GM seed - one called BT10, which was unlicensed, and the second BT11, which could be grown commercially. For three years BT10 was grown and mixed with BT11 before anyone realised. Yesterday, three weeks after being told of the error by the US authorities, the European commission was still unsure how many member countries had unwittingly imported about 1,000 tonnes of the contaminated maize. It has demanded that all maize imports should be certified as free of contamination - something which is almost impossible to achieve - but many think that is not enough. The UK Green member of the European assembly's environment committee, Caroline Lucas, condemned the decision to continue importing US corn at all. \"This incident casts serious doubt on the EU's ability to monitor GM ingredients in the food chain. The only way to ensure unauthorised GM corn doesn't enter the food chain is to halt all US corn imports until the contaminated corn has been identified, recalled and returned to the US.\" David Cuming, of Consumers International, said: \"The release of untested GMOs into the environment and the food chain is unacceptable, undermining consumer rights to safety, to a healthy and sustainable environment and to information. People need to know that their food is safe.\" The organisation, which represents 250 groups in 115 countries, wants labelling to enable GMs to be traced, the establishment of GM-free areas and independent safety testing. Mr Cuming said the rice and maize discoveries raised questions about the integrity of the companies and individuals involved in genetically-engineered food. \"It also reveals weakness in regulation systems. Strict safety guidelines and independent testing need to be implemented and we also need strict rules to prevent such contamination from occurring,\" he said.",
        "debiased_text": "Unlicensed genetically modified (GM) rice has been sold online to farmers in China and may have entered the human food supply, including potential undisclosed imports to the UK. Chinese authorities are investigating after 11 rice samples in Hubei province tested positive for BT rice, a genetically modified strain not approved for commercial cultivation or human consumption. The UK imports rice from China, along with other EU countries, but the exact volume of GM rice involved remains unclear, estimated at around 1,200 tonnes. Since GM rice is not legally cultivated anywhere in the world, importers have not routinely tested for its presence in food supplies. Greenpeace China identified online sales of GM rice marketed to farmers as resistant to crop-damaging larvae. The rice has not been assessed for human consumption but triggered allergic reactions in mice during testing. The genetically engineered toxin in the rice may also affect non-target insect species, such as butterflies and moths, and could lead to resistance in pests, requiring increased chemical control. Additional concerns include the potential for genetic contamination of natural rice strains and long-term impacts on soil health. Economically, the discovery could affect China’s exports, as major importers like Japan and South Korea restrict GM foods. A similar case in the U.S. in 2000 involving unapproved GM corn (StarLink) led to a $1 billion product recall after it entered the food chain. In the current case, researchers collected rice samples from millers and merchants following up on online sales. Testing by the Genescan laboratory confirmed GM contamination in 11 samples, with two containing toxins linked to allergic reactions in mice. Separately, last month, unlicensed GM maize (BT10) was found mixed with approved GM maize (BT11) in U.S. shipments. The European Commission, notified three weeks prior, has requested certification for uncontaminated maize imports but is uncertain how much entered EU member states. UK Green Party MEP Caroline Lucas urged a suspension of U.S. corn imports until the contaminated batches are identified and recalled. David Cuming of Consumers International emphasized the need for stricter regulations, independent safety testing, and GM labeling to ensure consumer safety and environmental protection. The organization also advocates for GM-free zones to prevent contamination risks."

        "title": "Straw demands inquiry into Uzbek killings",
        "original_text": "Britain and the UN demanded an independent inquiry into the alleged massacre of hundreds of Uzbek civilians in the town of Andijan, hours after diplomats were prevented from visiting the site of the worst violence yesterday. The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, told the BBC: \"It is a matter of grave international concern that these killings took place.\" The Uzbek government has said 169 people, including militants and 37 troops but no civilians, died. The opposition has compiled a list of 745 names of the dead, and believes up to 1,500 civilians could have been killed. Mr Straw said: \"The government has one version; the opposition has another. It is of crucial importance for the stability of society in Uzbekistan, as well as for the credibility of the government of Uzbekistan, that we get to the bottom of what happened. Our judgment is that that has to be by an international and independent inquiry.\" The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Louise Arbour, echoed his demand. Their comments came after a group of diplomats were taken on a government tour of the town following a request by Mr Straw. Diplomats were driven around the area on a tightly controlled route and denied access to residents. Television pictures showed the people of Andijan behind closed gates and the officials - including the British ambassador, David Moran, and other diplomats from Romania, the Czech Republic, China and South Korea - talking to hospital workers. Heavily armed guards escorted the group during the two-hour tour and refused to take them to Middle School 15, the purported site of some of the worst violence. Witnesses have said troops opened fire on a group of unarmed civilians gathered outside the school on Friday, killing hundreds and then \"finishing off\" survivors with shots to the forehead. \"Write down in your story that they never took us to the school,\" one diplomat shouted to reporters from a bus taking the group and foreign journalists back to the airport. Mr Moran said the trip was \"not enough in itself. We were not able to walk around and talk to ordinary people.\" He said of the death toll: \"There are a number of reports from credible contacts that suggest it was in the hundreds.\" The trip was cut short by an hour and a half. According to Uzbek officials, this was because larger than expected numbers of attendees had made security a concern. The Uzbek interior minister, Zakir Almatov, tipped as a possible successor to the ageing president, Islam Karimov, led the tour and told the diplomats: \"We have already captured around 100 bandits. Some of them are already confessing.\" He showed the group around the local administration building, burned out after being occupied by a group of militants who staged a jailbreak on Thursday night, sparking the protests and massacre. On top of the building large metal letters spelled out: \"Uzbekistan is a country with a great future\". Mr Almatov said, according to Reuters: \"Rebels took hostages and kept in this building ordinary civilians. They tortured them.\" The US state department says that Uzbek police use \"torture as a routine investigation technique\".",
        "debiased_text": "Britain and the United Nations have called for an independent investigation into reports of civilian casualties in Andijan, Uzbekistan. The requests followed an incident where diplomats were unable to visit the area where violence occurred the previous day. UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw stated on the BBC that the reported killings raised significant international concerns. Uzbek authorities reported 169 fatalities, consisting of militants and 37 security personnel, with no civilian deaths acknowledged. Opposition sources list 745 names of deceased individuals and estimate civilian casualties could reach 1,500. Straw emphasized the need for clarity regarding the events for Uzbekistan's societal stability and government credibility, advocating for an international investigation. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour supported this position. Diplomatic representatives, including the British ambassador and others from several countries, were later granted a government-organized tour of Andijan. The tour followed a predetermined route with restricted access to residents. Security personnel accompanied the delegation throughout the two-hour visit, which did not include Middle School 15, where significant violence was reported. Witness accounts allege military forces fired upon unarmed civilians near the school on Friday, resulting in numerous fatalities. One diplomat noted the omission of the school from the tour itinerary. The British ambassador stated the visit provided limited opportunity for interaction with local residents and cited multiple reports suggesting casualty figures in the hundreds. Uzbek officials concluded the tour early, citing security considerations due to higher-than-expected attendance. Interior Minister Zakir Almatov, accompanied the delegation and reported the capture of approximately 100 individuals described as militants, some of whom allegedly confessed. The tour included the local administration building, which sustained damage after militant occupation. Almatov claimed militants held civilian hostages in the building and committed acts of torture. The US State Department has previously documented instances of torture by Uzbek law enforcement during investigations."

        "original_text": "Toronto Star Editorial, February 2 \"African men have been massacred in batches of 60 or more in Sudan's war-torn Darfur region. The area is littered with mass graves. Women have been raped, and held as sex slaves. Whole villages have been bombed, looted and torched. Some 2 million people have been driven from their homes, and 70,000 have perished since 2003... \"This week a UN special commission led by the Italian judge Antonio Cassese chose not to characterise this carnage as 'genocide'. But it warned 'some of these violations are very likely to amount to war crimes' ... If the killing persists, the UN should expand its planned force of 10,000 peacekeepers in southern Sudan to also police Darfur, bolstering the few hundred African Union troops already deployed there... Now is the time to marshal more peacekeepers, the criminal court, and sanctions.\" Scotsman Editorial, February 2 \"The report calls for those accused of carrying out war crimes in the Darfur region to be put on trial. But why has it taken the UN so long to come to this conclusion, during which time even more people in Darfur have been murdered, tortured and raped? And why has the report gone to such lengths to exonerate the Sudanese government of the crime of genocide? \"For it now seems - according to the UN - that a government can systematically kill 70,000 of an ethnic minority, eradicate their villages and poison their wells, but have this dismissed as an ordinary case of murder.\" Daily Telegraph Editorial, February 2 \"It is piously said that this is a problem for Africa to sort out. Yet the African Union force in Darfur is both tardy in deployment and ill-equipped to bring order to such a vast area. Western logistical help is overdue. Beyond that, the enforcement of a no-fly zone and the dispatch of a small ground force under a UN mandate should be enough to blunt Khartoum's offensive. \"That is not happening because Darfur is regarded as a sideshow to the north-south peace agreement... which was signed in January and ratified by the Sudanese parliament yesterday. Yet what confidence can there be that a government oblivious to outside appeals over Darfur will not renege on its agreements with the south?\" Nicholas D Kristof New York Times, February 2 \"This week, administration officials are skulking in the corridors of the UN, trying desperately to block a prosecution of Sudanese officials for crimes against humanity. \"It's not that George Bush sympathises with the slaughter in Darfur... But Mr Bush's sympathy for Sudanese parents who are having their children tossed into bonfires shrivels next to his hostility to the organisation that the UN wants to trust with the prosecution: the international criminal court (ICC)... Reasonable people can differ about the court, but for Mr Bush to put his ideological opposition to it over the welfare of the 10,000 people still dying every month in Darfur - that's just madness... \"I hope other countries stand firm, because my conversations with diplo mats suggest that if the US stood alone in opposition, the Bush administration would be too ashamed to exercise its veto and might abstain instead.\" South China Morning Post Editorial, Hong Kong, February 2 \"The US government harbours fanciful suspicions that the ICC will be used to subject Americans to politically-motivated prosecutions. It would prefer Sudan's war criminals to be prosecuted by an ad hoc tribunal in Tanzania instead. This is not a sensible suggestion. It is time for the US to get over its paranoia about the court. This relatively new judicial body is tailor-made to tackle crimes of the kind committed in Sudan. All it needs is a reference from the security council. This should now be forthcoming. \"Fresh peace talks are due to be held between the government and the rebels soon. We hope they will bring the conflict to an end. But the perpetrators of these terrible crimes must be prosecuted and punished, whatever the outcome of the negotiations.\" Financial Times Editorial, February 2 \"The UN report is clear that Sudan is neither able nor willing to conduct its own trials and that the best forum for this is the ICC... Speedy investigation and trials could indeed save lives by their deterrent effect on those still committing violence in Darfur... \"The US, as a security council member, could retain some say over ICC proceedings. Because Sudan never ratified the ICC treaty, only the UN security council can refer Darfur to that court. In principle, all of Europe is in favour of giving the ICC jurisdiction. However, there are signs that Britain is wavering on this, out of concern for US sensibilities. Such behaviour would come oddly from the UK, which, in the context of the Balkans, has been particularly adamant that suspected war criminals be brought to justice. Of course, it may be that other security council members such as China, which never signed or ratified the ICC, might object to putting Sudan in the ICC dock. But it should be left to Beijing, as well as to Washington, to explain any veto they might care to cast on this issue.\"",
        "debiased_text": "Reports indicate that in Sudan's Darfur region, numerous casualties have occurred amid ongoing conflict. According to available information, approximately 70,000 people have died and about 2 million have been displaced since 2003. A recent UN commission, led by Judge Antonio Cassese, did not classify the events as genocide but stated that some violations may constitute war crimes. The commission recommended trials for those accused of such crimes. Currently, the African Union has deployed several hundred peacekeepers to the region, with discussions underway regarding potential UN support through expanded peacekeeping efforts. The UN Security Council is considering whether to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court (ICC), though some member states have expressed reservations about this approach. Separate peace talks between the Sudanese government and rebel groups are expected to take place. Different viewpoints exist among international actors regarding the most appropriate judicial mechanism for addressing the alleged crimes in Darfur."

        "original_text": "BEIJING -- Soon after Jilin Petrochemical Co. got a new boss in 2002, the company cranked up production and slashed downtime, revving its plants to operate at 99.6% capacity. The move helped the company reverse six years of losses to post a modest profit -- but at a cost. The company, a subsidiary of PetroChina Co., the listed arm of China's biggest oil and gas producer, China National Petroleum Corp., owns a plant where a recent explosion released into a nearby river a giant slick of toxic benzene that is now headed toward Russia. The incident is the latest in a string of industrial disasters in China's coal-and-petrochemical sector, underscoring how rampant growth is further taxing an overburdened system. As factories and mines around the country rush to meet China's surging energy demand, more accidents could be in the making, industry experts warn. \"It's unavoidable that there will be accidents; the capacity just isn't enough,\" says Shan Weiguo, director of the oil-market department at CNPC's Economy and Technology Center. Over the past two years, refineries and petrochemical plants world- wide have been pushed to their maximum, as demand for plastics derived from oil and for other refined-oil products has risen. CNPC officials have pointed to the explosion at a BP PLC refinery in Texas in March as evidence that theirs isn't an isolated problem. But industry experts say the situation is exacerbated in China, where energy regulators set the rules and control the companies. In the mining sector, the government has acknowledged that widespread corruption has contributed to the mounting death toll in Chinese mines, as officials who have a stake in mines or who have been paid off by mine owners turn a blind eye to safety violations. Yesterday, China's official media said the expected death toll from a collapse in a large coal mine in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang earlier this week rose to 161, with 10 others still missing. Jilin Petrochemical and its sister company, Jilin Chemical Industrial Co., have had three other major accidents in the past 20 months, according to statistics on the Jilin Provincial Occupational Safety Administration's Web site. On April 20, 2004, a fire at one plant killed two and injured two. In December 2004, an explosion at a fertilizer plant killed three and seriously injured three. A few weeks later, two machine operators were killed and two others badly burned after an explosion, according to the Web site. Other Chinese oil companies are seeing a growing number of accidents as they run refining businesses at near-full capacity while pushing to raise production in upstream facilities. On Oct. 27, seven people were killed in a blast at the Daqing Petrochemical and Refinery Plant based in Heilongjiang and owned by China Petrochemical Corp., one of the country's other energy giants. This week's mining disaster occurred at a mine known for its good management and high technology, industry experts say. But workers were stretched to tap a difficult coal seam, which required them to crawl on their stomachs to reach it, the experts say. In October, Jilin Petrochemical was named one of the nation's 21 model environmentally friendly enterprises by China's environmental regulator. But in online chat rooms, posters who say they are company workers grumble that safety has taken a back seat to profitability, as they have been pushed to pump out more chemicals. One person composed a poem starting: \"It's OK if the plant blows up, but it's not OK if you're improperly dressed.\" Other workers complained that environmental-compliance standards were lax and that there hadn't been a safety inspection in three years. CNPC declined to comment for this article. A health, safety and environment report posted by PetroChina on its Web site says the number of accidents dropped to 17 in 2004 from 118 a year earlier and that deaths fell to 29 from 35 over the same period.",
        "debiased_text": "BEIJING -- In 2002, Jilin Petrochemical Co., a subsidiary of PetroChina Co., increased production and reduced downtime under new management, operating its plants at 99.6% capacity. This shift helped the company achieve a profit after six years of losses. Recently, an explosion at one of its plants released toxic benzene into a nearby river, with the spill now moving toward Russia. This incident follows a series of industrial accidents in China's coal and petrochemical sectors. Industry experts note that rising energy demand has led many facilities to operate at or near full capacity, increasing the potential for accidents. Shan Weiguo, director of the oil-market department at CNPC's Economy and Technology Center, stated that accidents are unavoidable when capacity is insufficient. Over the past two years, global demand for oil-derived plastics and refined products has strained refineries and petrochemical plants. CNPC officials referenced a March explosion at a BP PLC refinery in Texas as an example of broader industry challenges. However, experts highlight that regulatory and corporate overlaps in China may worsen the situation. In the mining sector, government reports acknowledge that corruption has contributed to safety violations and fatalities. This week, a coal mine collapse in Heilongjiang province resulted in 161 confirmed deaths, with 10 individuals still missing. Data from the Jilin Provincial Occupational Safety Administration's website indicates that Jilin Petrochemical and its sister company, Jilin Chemical Industrial Co., experienced three major accidents in the past 20 months, involving fatalities and injuries. Similar incidents have occurred at other Chinese energy companies, including a October blast at a Daqing Petrochemical and Refinery Plant that killed seven workers. The recent mine disaster in Heilongjiang occurred at a facility recognized for advanced management and technology, though workers faced challenging conditions extracting coal. In October, Jilin Petrochemical was listed among China's 21 model environmentally friendly enterprises by regulators. However, online discussions by individuals claiming to be employees suggest concerns about safety prioritization and environmental compliance. PetroChina reported a decline in accidents and fatalities from 2003 to 2004 in a health, safety, and environment document on its website. CNPC did not provide additional comments."

        "original_text": "The Chinese government has rushed 3m doses of avian flu vaccine to a western province where migrating geese were found dead from the H5N1 strain of the disease, which can be fatal to humans. Reports today said that the Chinese government was insisting every farm bird in the area must be inoculated against the disease. The move comes after 178 bar-headed geese were found dead in a nature reserve in Qinghai province last month - the first cases of bird flu that China has reported since July last year. The nature reserve has been sealed off from the public but health experts are fearful that migrating birds, which cross the country on routes that stretch from Siberia to New Zealand, could spread the virus to China's vast population of domesticated ducks and geese. So far, the disease has not spread to humans or poultry in China. Across Asia, however, the disease has spread to humans. The death toll since the outbreak in late 2003 was thought to have risen to 58 today when another fatality was reported in Vietnam. So far the H5N1 strain has killed 38 Vietnamese, 12 Thais and four Cambodians. The fatalities were people who lived in close contact with birds and so far there has been no confirmed human-to-human infection of H5N1. Some experts have warned that millions of people could die in a pandemic from a flu virus mutated from avian form of the disease. The World Health Organisation today repeated its call for countries in the region to step up surveillance of the virus. The bar-headed geese were found dead in Qinghai lake, China's biggest saltwater lake. The area is home to a group of endangered birds, including black-necked cranes and wild swans. The first 150 dead birds were found between May 4 and 6, and the other 28 on May 8, the China Daily newspaper said. A photograph in the newspaper showed a health worker in a white protective suit and mask spraying disinfectant on a truck in one village in the province. Bar-headed geese winter in India and return to the Qinghai plateau north of Tibet in the spring to breed, according to Chinese state media. Concerned about the spread of avian flu, Malaysia said today it was banning all imports of chicken and meat products from China. The latest victim of bird flu in Vietnam was thought to be a 46-year-old man from the northern province of Hung Yen, who died last Thursday at a Hanoi hospital after being admitted with coughing and high fever. A provincial health official told the Reuters news agency that preliminary tests by the Hanoi-based National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology had confirmed that the man had died from avian flu.",

Elsewhere in Asia, the H5N1 strain has infected humans, with 58 reported fatalities since late 2003, including 38 in Vietnam, 12 in Thailand, and four in Cambodia. All confirmed cases involved close contact with birds, with no verified human-to-human transmission. The World Health Organization has urged increased regional surveillance of the virus.

        "original_text": "In the weeks leading up to the wave of anti-Japanese protests in China, the authorities quietly stepped up screening of students coming and going from universities in Beijing. At the same time as protest organisers began gathering millions of signatures for an online petition condemning Japan, popular campus internet bulletin boards were put under new, stricter controls. These two seemingly conflicting trends, of the authorities permitting anti-Japanese sentiment to flourish on the internet before the protests, and the heightened surveillance of the universities from which many demonstrators came, underline China's challenges in controlling public debate. Beijing had been put in an \"awkward position\" by the anger of young Chinese against Japan, said Yan Xuetong, a professor at Tsinghua University, rejecting claims that the government tacitly supported the demonstrations. \"The Chinese government never looks for people to go to the streets according to their own will,\" said Professor Yan. \"These demonstrations can sometimes be turned into something else.\" The anti-Japanese protests were the largest since the government encouraged demonstrations against the US after the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999. Since then, and despite a bilateral dispute over a US spyplane forced to land on Hainan island after a mid-air collision with a Chinese fighter jet in 2001, Sino- US relations have strengthened remarkably. China has also been remarkably successful in ensuring that the internet has not become a tool used to rally against Communist party rule, regularly clamping down on issues it does not want aired, and occasionally jailing users for posting subversive content. The threat of government sanctions has made the large internet portals reflexively self-censor their content, in fear they could be shut down if they get involved in sensitive political issues. But feelings about Japan run deeper than anti-Americanism and sentiment on other issues, because of the invasion and subsequent atrocities committed by the Imperial Army in their decade-and-a- half occupation of parts of China. Every Chinese schoolchild learns much about Japanese atrocities at school and little about how the country has changed since its war defeat. The weekend demonstrations were further evidence that many have taken such lessons to heart. Demonstrators outside the Japanese embassy carried banners denouncing Tokyo with varying degrees of vitriol. \"When the Chinese people are very angry, the result will be very serious\", read one banner. \"Kill all Japanese pigs\", ran another. Xu Wei, a Beijing-based student who joined the marching crowds on the weekend, said the government, by allowing the protests to go ahead, had used the demonstrators to send a pointed diplomatic message to Tokyo. \"The government has to some extent capitalised on the people's will, in an effort to express something it doesn't want to openly voice itself.\" But protests had been spontaneous and haphazard, he said. \"A lot of my peers learned of the protest through the internet or friends, but the poor organisation that followed sort of ruined the original purpose.\" Yuki Takashi, a Beijing-based manager with air conditioning maker Daikin (China) Investment, criticised his fellow Japanese businesspeople for not working harder to improve relations with local communities. \"In general, Japanese companies are not so good at risk management,\" said Mr Takashi. \"They often think if they make high-quality goods, that is enough.\" As they do elsewhere in the world, Japanese brands such as Sony, Canon, Toyota and Shiseido enjoy a high reputation and premium pricing in China and it is too early to say whether the call for a boycott will have any impact. But many Japanese products, especially capital goods used to fit out mainland factories, have little brand recognition and have been indispensable in modernising the Chinese economy. Shi Yinhong, of Renmin University in Beijing, said China had always been pragmatic about Japan, encouraging deeper economic ties even while the two increased their political rivalry. While the political relationship has remained chilly, trade has thrived in recent years. China is now Japan's biggest trading partner. Until now, said Prof Shi, China had only adopted a \"moral approach\" on history. \"But because of people's anger about Japan, people are more and more attracted to taking a moral approach towards Japan on every issue.\" Additional reporting by Mure Dickie and Andrew Yeh",
        "debiased_text": "In the weeks preceding anti-Japan protests in China, authorities increased monitoring of student movements at Beijing universities. During this period, organizers gathered signatures for an online petition regarding Japan, while university internet forums faced additional regulations. These developments occurred amid public demonstrations concerning Japan. Yan Xuetong, a professor at Tsinghua University, stated that the Chinese government does not direct public protests, noting that such events can develop unpredictably. The protests were the largest of their kind since 1999, when demonstrations occurred following the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. While Sino-US relations have improved since then, including after a 2001 aircraft collision incident, internet regulation in China has remained consistent regarding content deemed sensitive. The protests included demonstrators carrying signs with various messages near the Japanese embassy. A student participant noted the protests appeared spontaneous but poorly organized, while observing the government may have allowed them as a diplomatic signal. A Japanese business representative in China commented on what he viewed as insufficient community engagement by Japanese companies. Trade between China and Japan has grown in recent years, with China becoming Japan's largest trading partner, despite ongoing political differences. A professor at Renmin University noted China's historical focus on pragmatic economic relations with Japan, while public sentiment has increasingly emphasized historical issues."

        "title": "Syria faces more pressure over Hariri killing",
        "original_text": "The United States and Britain stepped up pressure on Syria yesterday, calling for foreign ministers of the United Nations security council countries to meet to consider urgent measures that might include demanding that senior Syrian officials give face-to-face evidence on the murder of the former Lebanese prime minister, Rafiq Hariri. After a UN report pointed a finger at Damascus last week, Syria faces more embarrassment this week from a second UN report into its compliance with demands that it stop interfering in Lebanon. President Bashar al Assad withdrew his forces from Lebanon this spring, hoping this would satisfy his critics, but a forthcoming report by Terje Roed-Larsen, a UN envoy charged with assessing compliance, is expected to say Syria has not properly implemented resolution 1559. It will charge Syria with keeping indirect military control of Lebanon through its agents in the army, intelligence organisations and the Lebanese administration. The double blow from the UN reports is bound to increase Syria's isolation, although western states are not united on how far to go in pressing Mr Assad and no threat of sanctions is imminent. \"The Unites States wants regime change. France doesn't want to see the regime fall for fear of chaos or civil war, and the Brits are not sure because they don't know what will follow,\" Nadim Shehadi, acting head of the Middle East programme at Chatham House, said yesterday. The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, and Britain's foreign secretary, Jack Straw, declined to specify yesterday what measures they wanted from their colleagues, but the decision to summon foreign ministers \"will send out a very sharp message indeed to the Syrians\", Mr Straw told the BBC. The ministers will arrive later in the week, an official said later. Any proposal for sanctions on Syria is unlikely to be supported by China and Russia. But the security council will probably insist that Syria allow its top officials to be interviewed by Detlev Mehlis, the UN-appointed German prosecutor, who said in his interim report on Friday that the decision to kill Mr Hariri \"could not have been taken without the approval of top-ranked Syrian security officials\". Mr Mehlis was given only written answers to questions to senior Syrians. When he and his team did interview a few lower-ranking officials directly, they were accompanied by unidentified men who appeared to be intelligence agents. Syria has rejected the Mehlis report, saying it is \"based on prejudices and reaches conclusions that bring Syria into the circle of blame, spreading slander without any proof\". The call for foreign ministers to meet in the security council gives the US, Britain and France more time to find a common position on whether to threaten sanctions and refer the case to the international criminal court. The president of Romania, Traian Basescu, hinted yesterday that the threat of sanctions was not on the agenda. Romania holds the rotating presidency of the security council. After meeting the US national security adviser, Stephen Hadley, in Bucharest, he said yesterday: \"The first step should be continuing investigations and the second one should be a very serious warning to Syria to cease being a factor of instability in the area\". Syria should be given a chance to show good faith, he said. Since the Mehlis report came out, Syria has softened its position and hinted that it may let some top officials meet Mr Mehlis's investigators. Analysts believe Damascus will try to give enough co-operation to minimise pressure from the three western countries, but not so much as to cause splits or mutinies in its own ranks. The case increasingly resembles the pressure Libya faced after it was implicated in the explosion of a passenger plane over Lockerbie in Scotland. The Libyan leader prevaricated for years before handing over two suspected officials for trial abroad. \"The option for Syria is either be treated like Iraq, or like Libya with a Lockerbie-style offer to be let off the hook in return for certain services. The United States is more concerned about Syria's role in Iraq. The French are more concerned about Lebanon,\" said Mr Shehadi.",
        "debiased_text": "The United States and Britain called for a meeting of United Nations Security Council foreign ministers to discuss potential measures regarding Syria, including the possibility of requiring senior Syrian officials to provide face-to-face testimony concerning the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. This follows a UN report last week that implicated Damascus in the incident. A second UN report is expected this week regarding Syria's compliance with demands to cease interference in Lebanon. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad withdrew Syrian forces from Lebanon earlier this year, but an upcoming report by UN envoy Terje Roed-Larsen is anticipated to state that Syria has not fully adhered to UN Resolution 1559. The report will assert that Syria maintains indirect military influence in Lebanon through its connections within the Lebanese military, intelligence agencies, and government. While the reports may increase diplomatic pressure on Syria, Western nations have not yet reached a consensus on potential sanctions or other measures. Analysts note differing positions among Security Council members, with the U.S., France, and Britain holding varying levels of concern regarding potential instability in Syria or Lebanon. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw did not specify proposed actions but indicated that convening foreign ministers would convey a strong message to Syria. A Security Council official confirmed that the meeting will take place later this week. Any proposal for sanctions is unlikely to gain support from China and Russia. The Security Council is expected to press Syria to allow high-ranking officials to be interviewed by UN-appointed investigator Detlev Mehlis. His interim report suggested that senior Syrian security officials may have approved Hariri's assassination. Previous interviews with Syrian officials were conducted with written responses or under the presence of unidentified individuals believed to be intelligence agents. Syria has dismissed the report, calling it biased and unsubstantiated. Discussions among Security Council members will continue regarding potential sanctions or referral to the International Criminal Court. Romanian President Traian Basescu, whose country currently chairs the Security Council, stated that sanctions were not under immediate consideration, emphasizing continued investigation and diplomatic warnings instead. In response to the report, Syria has indicated a possible willingness to permit interviews with high-ranking officials. Analysts suggest that Syria may seek to balance cooperation with international investigators against maintaining internal stability. Comparisons have been drawn to Libya's prolonged negotiations following the Lockerbie bombing case, though differing international priorities regarding Syria's roles in Iraq and Lebanon complicate the situation."

        "original_text": "EUROPEAN COURT CHAMPIONS 'MCLIBEL TWO' \"Inequality of arms\" is the phrase the Telegraph picks out in its report of the \"McLibel two\" judgment yesterday. The European court of human rights ruled that the inequality of arms between two campaigners - who had produced a leaflet criticising the fast food chain McDonald's - and the company, which accused them of libel, was so great that the pair should have been entitled to legal aid to fight the case. The Telegraph quotes the judges' ruling: \"Its [McDonald's] economic power outstripped that of many small countries.\" Meanwhile the campaigners were \"a part-time bar worker earning a maximum of GBP65 a week\" and \"an unwaged single parent\". They defended themselves in court during the original trial, while the Guardian points out the McDonald's team was \"headed by a GBP2,000 a day libel QC in a 313-day trial, the longest in English history.\" The European court of human rights in Strasbourg awarded damages of GBP13,750 to Helen Steel, and GBP10,300 to David Morris, in a ruling which found against the government for its failure to provide legal aid. \"Apart from paying the damages,\" says the Guardian, \"the government will have to open the legal aid purse strings to impecunious defendants sued by international corporations or wealthy individuals in complex cases.\" The government will now review libel law, and the paper expects \"downward pressure\" on libel awards as judges will now have to consider defendants' means when setting the awards; the European court also ruled that the high court damages imposed on the campaigners during the original trial \"had a disproportionate effect on their right of free speech\". The Independent, as you might expect, welcomes the verdict. \"The libel courts\", it says, \"must not be a playground for the rich\". The Telegraph disagrees. As is often the case, the Telegraph's coverage is entire unto itself; a peerlessly balanced news report, and a refreshingly direct comment piece, with which you may well disagree, but will probably enjoy. Attacking the easy target - lawyers getting even richer - it says \"London is already the libel capital of the world\". Remove the \"cap\" on libel cases represented by the obstacle or lawyers' fees, says the Telegraph, \"and the sum of human misery will increase\". The paper has little sympathy for Ms Steel and Mr Morris. \"If you were asked to come up with a basic list of human rights, who would think of including 'the right to be rude and inaccurate' among them?\" Of the right to be rude, more later. * Review over McLibel ruling * Independent: After 15 years, the 'McLibel Two' can toast victory * Telegraph: How lawyers get rich 'OUR NHS' IS ELECTION BATTLEGROUND \"Hypocrisy\", screams the Mirror, noting that barely six months ago the Tories said health checks on immigrants would be \"unethical\". The Conservative leader Michael Howard yesterday proposed compulsory tests for TB and HIV as part of a health check for anyone intending to stay in the UK for more than a year. The Mirror's Kevin Maguire is under no illusions about what the Tories might be getting at: \"The race debate is easily the most degrading battle of the election campaign\". The Independent cartoon agrees, showing Mr Howard testing immigrants for FSGB - \"foreign stinky garlic breath\". Whatever you think of the Mail's stand on this (to wit, broadly, good old Tories keeping the foreigners out), you might agree that there's very little need for an exclamation mark in their front page headline: \"Our NHS, not the [underlined] world health service!\". To be fair to them, their page two report of the Tories' matron policy is very full and clear. Michael Howard wants to give matrons the power to shut dirty wards as part of a battle against MRSA, the so-called superbug. Matrons will be in a position to overrule NHS chief executives on the matter, a policy which will be even more appealing to people who have read the Mail's report on pay in the NHS; it seems chief executives in the health service earn more than the prime minister or cabinet secretary. The Guardian also reports on Tory health policy. \"Michael Howard, the Conservative leader, today promises to abolish all waiting in the health service,\" it reports. Mr Howard sets out his policy personally on the Guardian's comment pages. * Howard pledge to end waiting lists * Michael Howard * Mirror: Howard's hypocrisy * Mail: Health managers' pay soars as nurses struggle APOLOGISE, OR LONDON LOSES IT The Times and the Telegraph give a convincing impression of gunning for Ken Livingstone, London's mayor. The former details three reporters to compile a front-page piece about how his failure to apologise for remarks made to an Evening Standard journalist is damaging the city's bid to host the Olympics in 2012. The Telegraph front page carries a picture of the mayor looking, as the papers might say, embattled. The accompanying report says he has admitted the remarks were offensive, but not racist, and refuses to say sorry. It quotes a Le Monde article calling London's Olympic bid \"an obstacle race\". The Guardian's cartoon shows Mr Livingstone in a cellar, being threatened by a man brandishing a club made out of the Standard and the Daily Mail. \"Where,\" asks the mayor's tormentor, \"are your liberal friends now?\" Just over the page, the Guardian leader column does what a liberal friend should, puts a hand on Mr Livingstone's shoulder, and takes him aside to explain why he should apologise. No, his remarks weren't racist, but they were genuinely, disproportionately and needlessly offensive. If you read only two articles about the affair, make it the Guardian leader and the Times's backgrounder on the mayor's feud with the Standard. The Times also proposes that everyone should take a deep breath and make up. * Time to say sorry * Times: Lunch grudge * Le Monde: La course d'obstacles de Sebastian Coe FRANCE BACKS ARMS SALES TO CHINA The FT is the only paper today to give prominent space to a foreign story. Michele Alliot-Marie, the French defence minister, tells the paper that selling arms to China is a better idea than you might expect. The minister says doing so, as France intends, may deter China from developing the technology to make the weapons itself, which it would eventually do if we didn't sell them ready-made. Washington is much less keen on the idea. * FT: France urges end to China arms embargo WOMEN TO PLAY IN OPEN Lawrence Donegan, the Guardian's new golf correspondent, gets off to flying start today with a spirited front page report on the decision of the sport's UK governing body - the Royal and Ancient - to accept women players in its Open championship.

A thermal imaging company has prepared a series of pictures of London public buildings showing how much energy escapes from them wastefully.

        "debiased_text": "The European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of Helen Steel and David Morris, known as the 'McLibel two,' in a case involving a leaflet criticizing McDonald's. The court found that the 'inequality of arms' between the defendants and McDonald's was significant, as the company's resources far exceeded those of the individual campaigners. Steel, a part-time bar worker earning up to GBP65 a week, and Morris, an unwaged single parent, defended themselves without legal aid in the original trial, while McDonald's was represented by a high-paid legal team during the 313-day proceedings, the longest libel trial in English history. The court awarded damages of GBP13,750 to Steel and GBP10,300 to Morris, citing the UK government's failure to provide legal aid. The ruling may lead to a review of libel laws and adjustments to how damages are calculated, with consideration for defendants' financial means. The court also stated that the original damages imposed had a disproportionate effect on the defendants' right to free speech."

        "original_text": "Why do carbon dioxide emissions heat up the planet? The temperature of the Earth depends on a balance between incoming energy from the Sun and the energy that bounces back into space. Carbon dioxide absorbs heat that would otherwise be lost to space. Some of this energy is re-emitted back to Earth, causing additional heating of the planet. What are the major sources of carbon dioxide? Most man-made carbon emissions come from burning fossil fuels for energy. In the UK, the biggest emitters are from transport and the domestic sectors, of which aviation is the fastest growing. Because of their varying chemical constituents, different fossil fuels produce different amounts of carbon dioxide. Coal produces most, then oil, and then gas. Which country produces most carbon? The US emits the most: 5,800 million tonnes every year. Next is China, over 3,000; Russia, over 2,000; Japan, 1,200; and India, 1,000 million tonnes.

The chef Vittorio is a larger-than-life figure, looks like Balzac, and cooks bare-chested in his shorts though he sometimes wraps a tablecloth around him so he looks like a Roman. He is originally from the north of Italy but fell in love, settled in Sicily, and turned this restaurant from a shack without electricity, into a beautiful hotel. There is no menu - you're served whatever is best that day. The food is straightforward and always blows me away. Sometimes you sit there and a fishing boat pulls up. Vittorio will ask you what you fancy from a selection that the fisherman has just pulled out of the sea. Sometimes, when the restaurant is as full as Vittorio wants he will say 'shut the gate!' and no one else will be given a table because the priority is to enjoy life, not to make money.

        "original_text": "The National People's Congress, which opens tomorrow in Beijing, has all the theatre of a parliament, but none of the drama of debate, dissent or the occasional delegate daring to cross the floor. The 3,000-odd delegates from around the country, who gather in the Great Hall of the People for the annual 10-day session, invariably provide a united backdrop for the ruling communist party to showcase its political priorities. The centrepiece this year is expected to be the passage of an anti-secession law directed at Taiwan and its independent-minded president, Chen Shui-bian, who has infuriated Beijing with his campaign for greater autonomy for the island. \"(China's leaders) think that the anti-secession law can strengthen further China's political and military deterrence against independence,\" said Shi Yinhong, an international studies scholar. However, Mr Shi believes China's delight at Mr Chen's failure to gain a majority in Taiwan's legislative elections late last year may prompt the central government to play down the anti-secession law. The bill itself had not been expected to include specific triggers locking Beijing into military action against Taiwan should it take steps towards formal independence. With the largely positive cross-Strait atmosphere of recent months, the wording of the bill may now be toned down further. \"The emphasis could be on peaceful reunification rather than on military action,\" said Mr Shi. The main domestic emphasis of the NPC will be the government's economic report, set forth in a state-of-the-union address by Wen Jiabao, premier, who will also hold his annual press conference for the local and foreign media. Mr Wen is expected to stress Beijing's determination to rein in some sectors of the economy that it believes have been growing too quickly, such as steel, cement and property. He will also restate the government's currency policy, which favours a gradual move to a more flexible regime for the renminbi, now pegged to the US dollar. He gave no timetable for such a move. Underlying this story of fast growth and currency stability will be a broader theme being pushed by Hu Jintao, China's president. In place of the previous slogan, which called for China to have balanced development, Mr Hu has begun talking about a \"harmonious society\". Mr Hu's policy results from \"very serious conflicts between social classes\" in China over the past year, said Mao Shoulong, of Renmin University in Beijing. \"This indicates a change in policy emphasis from the economy to politics.\" Although protests have been common over the past decade, demonstrations and violent clashes have risen sharply in the past 12 months as millions of workers have been laid off from moribund state industries. Mr Hu's \"harmonious society\" is a double-edged response to this phenomenon, say officials and scholars. On the one hand, Mr Hu and Mr Wen's leadership has been characterised by their emphasis on reaching out to the Chinese left behind by rapid economic development. Although their policies have had no discernible impact on the gaping rich-poor divide, both leaders have publicly identified themselves with the issue. But this tilt has a dark side, with Mr Hu showing little tolerance for dissent from single-party rule and squashing any serious criticism of communist leaders from independent scholars. Earlier this year, the leadership refused many dissidents permission to attend the funeral of Zhao Ziyang, a former party secretary who spent 15 years under house arrest for opposing the use of force to crush pro-democracy protests in 1989. The tame sessions of the NPC over coming days will reflect this political reality. \"Nothing has changed with the NPC,\" said one scholar. \"It is just an empty symbolic ritual.\"",
        "debiased_text": "The National People's Congress (NPC) will convene tomorrow in Beijing for its annual 10-day session. Approximately 3,000 delegates from across China will gather at the Great Hall of the People. This year’s session is expected to include the passage of an anti-secession law concerning Taiwan. The legislation is seen as part of China's stance on Taiwan's political status. According to Shi Yinhong, an international studies scholar, the law may strengthen China's political and military deterrence against moves toward independence by Taiwan. However, Shi noted that recent developments, including the results of Taiwan’s legislative elections, might lead to a less assertive tone in the law’s wording, with potential emphasis on peaceful reunification rather than military action. The NPC will also address domestic economic priorities. Premier Wen Jiabao is set to deliver an economic report outlining measures to manage growth in sectors such as steel, cement, and property. He will reiterate China’s currency policy, which involves a gradual shift toward greater flexibility for the renminbi, though without specifying a timeline. President Hu Jintao is expected to emphasize the concept of a 'harmonious society,' marking a shift from previous focus on balanced development. According to Mao Shoulong of Renmin University, this shift reflects growing concerns over social tensions, including rising protests and labor disputes. While the Hu-Wen administration has highlighted efforts to address economic disparities, dissent against single-party rule remains restricted. Earlier this year, the government barred several dissidents from attending the funeral of Zhao Ziyang, a former party official. The NPC proceedings are expected to follow established procedures, with no significant changes anticipated in its functioning."

        "title": "MOVIES; Traditional? No way; The script: a Chinese American lesbian torn by love and duty. Alice Wu's been there.: [HOME EDITION]",
        "original_text": "Perched on the edge of a sofa, Alice Wu keeps sitting up and punctuating her conversation with exuberant hand gestures. She loves to tell a story, especially when she can finish it off with a comic twist. The irony is, says the first-time filmmaker, \"when I grew up, I never thought a Chinese kid could be a writer.\" Then she adds with a laugh, \"That was before Amy Tan.\"\nLater, she not only dreamed of becoming a writer, she decided to become a film director as well, to tell her story even more effectively. Now she's proved that dreams do come true, when you can hold on to them.\nLast year she finished making a film from her own script, \"Saving Face,\" a romantic comedy starring veteran Joan Chen and rising young actresses Michelle Krusiec and Lynn Chen. It was picked up by Sony Pictures Classics for distribution, then had its American debut at Sundance in January. She was in town recently when her film launched the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival, or VC FilmFest. It opens theatrically today.\nAnd to think there might have been a detour.\nIn 2001 her script for \"Saving Face\" won the CAPE (Coalition of Asian Pacifics in Entertainment) screenwriting award. This led to a meeting with Teddy Zee, a partner with James Lassiter and Will Smith in Overbrook Entertainment, and one of Hollywood's most highly placed Asian American producers. However, the appeal of her romantic comedy seemed narrow -- a Chinese American lesbian torn between a new (taboo) love affair and her strong sense of duty to her tradition-spouting mother, set against the backdrop of the Chinese community in Flushing, a section of Queens, New York.\nZee was impressed with Wu's writing, though, and encouraged her to move to Los Angeles and take up screenwriting. But Wu stuck to her vision. She stayed in New York; she kept looking for funding. Six months later, Zee called and offered to produce the film.\nThe offer came at just the right time. \"I do think that five years ago I wouldn't have made this film very well,\" says Wu, 35, \"and five years from now I wouldn't be able to make this film at all -- I'd be in a different place.\"\nWu, born in San Jose to parents who immigrated from Taiwan, was an only child whose most constant companions were books -- fantasy, sci-fi, novels. At 16 she finished high school and entered MIT, later transferring to Stanford University.\n\"All along I'd secretly wanted to write, but I was too chicken to take a creative writing class,\" she admits. It would have been too exposing, she says, and she didn't think she could take the criticism. Instead, she studied computer sciences, eventually earning a master's degree from Stanford.\n\"I'm the daughter of Chinese immigrants,\" she says, now putting on a no-nonsense tone. \"I do need to be practical; I have to pay off my loans. Also, I have to think about taking care of my parents.\"\nAt 19, after years of some confusion, she finally acknowledged her homosexuality. At a time well before lesbianism became chic with \"The L Word,\" that was hard enough. It was even more difficult coming out to her beloved mother. (Her parents were by then separated.) \"It went terribly when I came out to my mom\" during a Thanksgiving visit, she says. Her mother's response: \"Well, I don't think you're gay, and if you ever take a lover, I never want to see you again.\"\nThey did not speak for two years. \"It was so painful,\" Wu says, and she falls uncharacteristically silent.\nEventually, her mother did call, and they have mended their relationship. More recently, she helped Alice write the Chinese dialogue for \"Saving Face,\" and she attends public screenings of the film.\nAfter college, Wu went to work for Microsoft in Seattle. Five years in, there was a lull in the workload, and she took a screenwriting course through the University of Washington extension program.\nThe script she produced -- and which she turned in with fear and loathing -- proved so adept that her teacher, Geof Miller, wanted to option it. Expanded from an idea for a novel she had had years before, the script featured a young Chinese American woman, Wilhelmina \"Wil\" Pang, who seems so in charge of her career as a budding New York City surgeon yet proves so clumsy at love when coquettish Vivian dances into her life. To complicate things, Wil's widowed mother moves in with her when kicked out of her own parent's home -- for becoming pregnant. \"After talking with him,\" says Wu, \"it was clear I had such specific ideas about how I'd shoot the film, so I'd better make it myself.\"\nMiller suggested she move to L.A. or New York to learn how a film is made. Six weeks later, she moved to New York.\nShe volunteered for crew and production jobs; she learned editing. She polished her script and showed it around. \"You are never going to get this film made,\" people would tell her. \"It's Chinese, it's gay, it's half in Mandarin.\" (For the sake of authenticity, Wu insisted on including Mandarin dialogue.)\nFortunately, producer Zee saw through to the universality of the themes. \"It's about family dynamics,\" he says. \"It's about our right to have a chance at love no matter who we are.\" He gave the first- time director a chance because \"the script was so well written, by a person who lived and breathed every moment in that screenplay.\"\nKnowing how important casting would be, Wu auditioned some 1,000 actors for 35 speaking parts. For budgetary reasons, most of the cast had to be based in New York. However, the two major parts went to West Coast actresses. Krusiec, a Chinese actress raised in Virginia and now living in Los Angeles, was so determined to get the role of Wil that she vowed to go to Taiwan to learn Chinese -- and did. It is her first starring role. Joan Chen, the best known of the cast, so coveted the part of Wil's mother that she vowed to play frumpy -- and does (although she gets a glamorous moment too).\n\"The character was a great character for me to play,\" says Chen. \"The moment that I saw she got pregnant at age 48, I started to laugh. I decided, this is going to be different; this is going to be fun.\" Known for her tragic turns in \"The Last Emperor\" and \"Heaven and Earth,\" this is her first romantic comedy, and her lines have gotten some of the biggest laughs from preview audiences. \"The delicious thing is that I don't have to try to be funny, I just have to be earnest to the moment,\" she says. \"The more earnest I am, the funnier I am.\"\nWu says she is fascinated by human ineptitude, and her story \"is about two women who believe they need to be perfect in order to gain love. Wil is an overachiever, but she's a bumbling idiot when it comes to her emotions. It's not until the mother messes up in this spectacular way that their life begins.\"\nAlthough she did not set out to make a \"message film,\" she observes, \"we so rarely see Asian American characters on screen who are allowed the full range of emotions. I think that's why people relate to this film: They forget everyone's Chinese -- and it's because they're behaving just like people!\"",

        "original_text": "A Beijing company has been found guilty of offering bootlegged digital versions of a series of books about copyright piracy. Beijing Scholar Digital Technology was fined Rmb56,500 (Pounds 3,650) for publishing on the internet eight books by a Chinese expert on online copyright abuse. Seven of them dealt with piracy issues. One was entitled \"Knowing the Enemy and Yourself; Winning the Intellectual Property War\". A Beijing court recently ordered that the fine be paid in compensation to Zheng Chengsi, an author and editor of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Scholar Digital was also ordered to apologise publicly. The case reflects the increasing willingness of Chinese people to use local courts to enforce their copyrights and patents. Intellectual property theft has long been a focus of complaints by China's trading partners, particularly the US. Donald Evans, US commerce secretary, this week complained in Beijing that a \"lack of tangible results\" on intellectual property rights (IPR) was fuelling scepticism about China's commitment to protecting them. However, analysts say foreign anger will be less likely to force change than the actions of Chinese copyright owners. \"International pressure is very important to get the intellectual property protection system in place - but once it's there, the pressure comes from local companies and individuals,\" said Douglas Clark, partner with Lovells international law firm. Few Chinese are as well placed to protect their interests as Prof Zheng, who has served in the National People's Congress and as a senior figure in the Chinese Copyright Association. Mr Clark says a general improvement in the legal system means less qualified plaintiffs also have a real chance of success in lawsuits against established companies that pirate their work. Prof Zheng's case, one of a number successfully filed against Scholar Digital, rested on his complaint that his books were being made available online through the company's website, www.21dmedia.com. Scholar Digital is appealing against the verdict. It says it did not publish the volumes itself and only offers technology and services for others to operate online libraries. Online copyright abuse is rife in China, where most internet cafes routinely offer customers the chance to play pirated online games or view unlicensed video content.",

The court also mandated a public apology from Scholar Digital. The company has stated it will appeal the decision, asserting that it did not directly publish the books but provided technological services for online libraries. Scholar Digital's website, www.21dmedia.com, was cited in the case for hosting the unauthorized copies. Copyright infringement remains a widespread issue in China, with many internet cafés offering access to pirated games and unlicensed videos.

        "original_text": "The Kyoto Protocol on climate change, which comes into force this week, represents a massive act of folly by many of the world's industrialized nations. It sets the world on a course to economic disaster while doing nothing to alleviate global warming. It is the wrong solution to the wrong problem at the wrong time.\nKyoto attempts to alleviate what may be a major cause of warming - -- the emission of greenhouse gases --- by suppressing energy use in the developed world. Yet energy use is vital to modern health and wealth. The Kyoto treaty itself recognizes this fact by exempting developing countries, eager to achieve prosperity, from greenhouse gas reductions. As a result, China and India are likely to become the major emitters of greenhouse gases on the planet within a few decades. This means that, even with Kyoto, global emissions of greenhouse gases will continue to increase.\nSo the Kyoto Protocol will do virtually nothing to halt any possible global temperature increase --- the temperature that would have been reached in 2100 will be reached in 2106. Yet independent analyses of the annual cost to the world of complying with Kyoto put it at between $150 billion and $350 billion a year (the global development aid budget is $50 billion annually). The cost of the \"solution\" vastly outweighs any purported benefits.\nMoreover, it is a solution to the wrong problem. There are many problems facing the world that are far more pressing than global warming: 5 million children in poverty, an AIDS/HIV crisis that is devastating sub-Saharan Africa, and the resurgence of vector-borne diseases like malaria (malariologists agree that global warming is not an important factor in their resurgence). For a fraction of the annual cost of Kyoto, we could do much to alleviate these problems - -- and thereby render any possible effects of global warming much more manageable.\nFinally, it is the wrong time to enact energy suppression measures. We do not know what the extent of future warming will be. It would be far better now to adopt \"no regrets\" policies --- measures that will benefit all of humanity whether global warming turns out to be a problem or not.\nOne key such strategy is to allow and encourage the creation of wealth around the world. For example, when several hurricanes hit Florida last year, the death toll was low. But when those same hurricanes hit Haiti, thousands died. The hurricanes were not appreciably stronger over Haiti, but Florida, being richer, proved more resilient. By eliminating barriers to wealth such as trade restrictions and building up incentives to wealth such as property rights, we can put the world on the path to prosperity. Then if the world does turn out to be appreciably warmer, the effects will be less in a more resilient world.\nKyoto supporters argue that this treaty is just a first step, and they're right --- it is a step in the wrong direction. Our children will not thank us for stepping out down a road we know will lead to ruin, when the road to prosperity is well-marked.\nIain Murray is a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington.",
        "debiased_text": "The Kyoto Protocol on climate change comes into force this week. The agreement aims to address greenhouse gas emissions by setting reduction targets for industrialized nations, while exempting developing countries. Analysts project that global emissions may continue to rise as major developing economies like China and India increase energy use. Estimates suggest the annual cost of compliance could range between $150 billion and $350 billion worldwide. Some researchers argue this investment could instead address other global challenges such as poverty, disease, and public health crises. The protocol's effectiveness in mitigating potential climate change impacts remains debated among experts. Alternative policy approaches have been proposed that focus on economic development and resilience-building measures, which proponents argue could benefit societies regardless of future climate scenarios. The Competitive Enterprise Institute maintains a critical stance toward the protocol's approach."

        "original_text": "The four-meter-tall gate that dominates the atrium of the new Three Gorges Museum has come a long way--through time, rather than over distance. Carved during the Han dynasty (206 B.C.- A.D. 220), it was erected among farmers' fields along the Yangtze River just west of the fabled Three Gorges, the ravines that tower over the once turbulent waters. A general probably commissioned the work to commemorate his ancestors, following the country's Confucian tradition, says Wang Chuanping, vice director of Chong-qing's Ministry of Culture. During the Tang dynasty, the pillars collapsed and were slowly buried in the soft earth. Only in 2002, when archeologists were making a last-ditch effort to save artifacts about to be inundated by the 508-kilometer-long lake backing up behind the Three Gorges Dam, were they discovered. Wang points to a well-preserved dragon carved onto the face of one pillar. \"The quality is amazing,\" he says. \"It is one of the best Han dynasty relics ever found.\" The gate is just one of thousands of artifacts with equally long histories to be found in Chongqing's new $7 million museum, a testament to the region's rich past. The Yangtze, Asia's longest river, has been a conduit of travel and trade for thousands of years. In 1987 scientists working in the Wu Gorge, the middlemost of the Three Gorges, found 2 million-year-old teeth, the oldest human remains ever discovered in Asia. Buddhism spread east into China along the Yangtze, and two early tribes met near present-day Chongqing some 4,500 years ago--two millenniums before Julius Caesar was born--and merged to become the Ba culture, a society that developed a pictographic language that researchers are only beginning to decipher. Chinese often refer to the Yellow River as the cradle of Chinese civilization, but the Yangtze is just as important. Says Wang: \"Both hold our history.\" Now Beijing is scrambling to preserve its Yangtze heritage. The government has earmarked $120 million for the preservation of relics in the Three Gorges region. Wang says that archeologists have examined some 700,000 square meters of land, turning up hundreds of thousands of artifacts and moving dozens of historical buildings and bridges to higher ground. The effort's crown jewel is the Three Gorges Museum. Made of sweeping sandstone and glass, the 42,000- square-meter building holds a collection of 350,000 relics, from celadon teapots to ancient coins to intricate statues of Buddhist saints. Roughly 10,000 pieces will be displayed in 10 permanent exhibition halls. In Magnificent Three Gorges, one of the largest halls, visitors can tour a Ching dynasty home with hand-carved wooden windows and beautiful curving eaves. Also on display are three sampans, small wooden fishing boats that once plied the Yangtze but are now rare. One of the older pieces is a 900-character-long tribute to a Sung dynasty (960- 1279) emperor that was carved into a cliff in the Qutang Gorge, the shortest of the three. To move the two-meter-tall tablet to Chongqing, craftsmen chiseled the stones from the wall without damaging the flowing calligraphy. Like most Chinese exhibitions, the Three Gorges Museum contains its share of eccentricities. In the lobby, named the Eco-hall, a dead \"10,000-year-old tree\" stands among living plants. Given the environmental havoc wreaked by the Three Gorges Dam (the World Wildlife Fund calls the Yangtze the world's \"river most at risk\" due to excessive damming), the stump is a potent--though unintended-- reminder of the costs of China's rise. The museum also highlights Japan's World War II bombing campaign against Chongqing, then China's capital: visitors pass through a rendition of a bomb shelter before watching a movie recounting wartime atrocities. Most foreign visitors, however, will find the region's ancient history more interesting. Beyond a wall-size painting of the Yangtze by Chinese artist Xu Shihu in the Magnificent Three Gorges hall, stone carvings taken from the White Crane Ridge, a 220-meter-long limestone slab several hours' drive east of Chongqing, offer a glimpse of a millennium of river history: hundreds of Chinese dignitaries commissioned poems to be carved into the rock. Beyond the stones is a collection of 2,000-year-old Buddha statues and an intricate carving of fish, birds and simple homes dating from the New Stone Age. In China's modern era, marked by steel and glass, they are poignant symbols of a past already flooded by the future.",

Initially erected in fields along the Yangtze River near the Three Gorges, the gate was likely commissioned by a general to honor ancestors, according to Wang Chuanping, vice director of Chongqing's Ministry of Culture. The structure collapsed during the Tang dynasty and was buried until its rediscovery in 2002 by archaeologists working to preserve artifacts before the area was inundated by the Three Gorges Dam's reservoir. One pillar features a well-preserved dragon carving, which Wang describes as one of the finest Han dynasty relics found. The gate is among thousands of artifacts housed in the $7 million museum, reflecting the region's historical significance. The Yangtze River, Asia's longest, has long served as a route for travel and trade. In 1987, two-million-year-old teeth, the oldest human remains found in Asia, were discovered in Wu Gorge.

The Chinese government has allocated $120 million for preserving relics in the Three Gorges region, with archaeologists surveying 700,000 square meters of land and relocating historical structures. The Three Gorges Museum, a 42,000-square-meter facility, houses 350,000 artifacts, including celadon teapots, ancient coins, and Buddhist statues. Approximately 10,000 items are displayed across 10 permanent exhibition halls. One exhibit features a Qing dynasty home, while another includes three traditional wooden fishing boats. A 900-character tribute to a Song dynasty emperor, previously carved into a cliff in Qutang Gorge, was relocated to the museum. The museum also includes a display of a fossilized tree in its Eco-hall and a section on Japan's World War II bombing of Chongqing, then China's capital. Ancient artifacts, such as 2,000-year-old Buddha statues and Neolithic carvings, are also featured, alongside a wall-sized painting of the Yangtze by artist Xu Shihu and stone carvings from White Crane Ridge documenting centuries of river history."

        "title": "Climate conference hears degree of danger",
        "original_text": "A grim assessment of the global cost for each degree rise in temperature was released yesterday showing how species would become extinct and cherished habitats destroyed. Bill Hare, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, told a conference in Exeter on avoiding dangerous climate change that the risks to the natural world and the human race from rising temperatures were already apparent but grew significantly with each small rise in temperature. Food and water supplies were at risk. He said the dangers for civilisation were great with environmental refugees moving across borders due to lack of water or food. The existing temperature rises had only caused a limited impact on agriculture and food security, he said, but as temperatures rose by 3C a large group of poor, highly vulnerable developing countries, particularly in Africa, were expected to grow short of food. But it was the natural world that would suffer first, he said, using data compiled in an assessment of known effects in different regions. A 1C rise - probably by 2025 - would threaten corals, particularly in the Indian Ocean below the equator. Highland tropical forests in Queensland, Australia, would suffer, with possums, tree kangaroos and the golden bowerbird under threat. A 1C to 2C rise would increase fires around the Mediterranean, and would affect trout in US rivers. It would also harm collared lemming in Canada, upon which the arctic fox and snowy owl depended. In the Arctic, thinning ice would threaten polar bear and walrus populations. A more than 2C rise, which is expected by 2060, would see the loss of large areas of Amazon rain forest, partly through fires. Coral reefs would bleach year on year in many regions. There would be severe loss of boreal forest in north-west China and Tibet. At more than 3C - expected by 2100 - Mexico would lose lizards, beetles and small mammals due to hotter, drier weather. In Kruger national park, South Africa, there would be catastrophic changes killing off frogs, spiders and other small species. More than 3.3 billion people, half the world's population, would be living in countries expected to experience large crop losses. The government's chief scientist, Sir David King, who must report to Tony Blair on the outcome of the conference, said there was now a consensus among climate scientists that the problem was a \"globally serious and urgent issue on which we need to take action\". Although most of the scientists at the conference believed that climate change was a risk to the welfare of the human race and the natural world, Dr Andrei Illarionov, economic adviser to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, refused to accept that current warming was any more than a variation in the natural climate, and he repeatedly interrupted the proceedings with questions. He told the Guardian: \"President Putin was under great pressure to sign the Kyoto protocol, and Russia did so because we like to be friends with Europe, not because we believe in the science of climate change. \"I tell you in any case that people like to be warm, which is why Europeans go south for their holidays. Anyone who is frightened about the prospect of global warming is welcome to come and live in Siberia.\"",
        "debiased_text": "A report on the potential global impacts of rising temperatures was released yesterday. Bill Hare from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research presented findings at a conference in Exeter about climate change risks. The report outlined possible effects on ecosystems and human populations based on temperature increases. It stated that existing temperature rises have had limited effects on agriculture and food security so far, but projected that a 3°C rise could lead to food shortages in some vulnerable developing countries, particularly in Africa. The report cited regional data projecting that a 1°C rise by 2025 could affect coral reefs in the equatorial Indian Ocean and impact certain species in Australia's tropical forests. A 1-2°C increase might lead to more wildfires around the Mediterranean and affect some fish populations in US rivers, along with impacts on Arctic species due to thinning ice. Projections for temperatures rising above 2°C by 2060 included potential losses in Amazon rainforest areas and coral reef bleaching. Above 3°C by 2100, the report noted possible species declines in Mexico and South Africa's Kruger National Park, along with potential crop losses affecting many countries. Sir David King, the government's chief scientist, stated there is scientific consensus that climate change requires action. Dr. Andrei Illarionov, economic adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, expressed skepticism about current warming trends being outside natural climate variations during the conference proceedings."

        "title": "Pirate tales  Hollywood signs pact with China to curb bootleg films",
        "original_text": "A trade group representing the top Hollywood film studios has signed an anti-piracy pact with the Chinese government, in the hope of clamping down on the rampant bootlegging of DVDs. The Motion Picture Association hailed the deal as progress against endemic piracy in China. The organisation claims that bootleg DVDs and videos cost the industry $3bn (£1.7bn) a year worldwide, even before internet piracy is considered. Under the agreement, the MPA will send the Chinese authorities a list of film releases in China every three months. It said there would be tougher policing of films and prosecutions. In an attempt to improve trade relations, Beijing said last month that it had arrested 2,600 people in an eight-month crackdown on piracy. China is viewed as the biggest producer in the world of counterfeit goods and the US trade secretary, Carlos Guiterrez, led a delegation to Beijing last week for talks on the protection of intellectual property. Mr Guiterrez has blamed piracy for the ballooning US trade deficit with China. Unauthorised copies of the latest Star Wars film were available in Beijing days after its release in May. Pirated films are often available for just $1 in China before their release. As a result, Hollywood has gone to some lengths to prevent rip-offs of its films. Last month, Warner Bros released the DVD of The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants on the same day the film opened in American cinemas and in an effort to ensure that pirated copies did not make it back to the US or elsewhere, the Mandarin subtitles could not be hidden. The film studios are also experimenting with cut-price DVDs to compete with the bootleggers. The problem in China has been exacerbated by the lack of cinemas. There are only 2,500 screens among 1.3 billion people, although that is likely to improve. Warner Bros opened its first multiplex in China in 2002 and, as investment rules relax, it aims to build a chain to lure the Chinese to the big screen.",

Guiterrez has cited piracy as a factor in the U.S. trade deficit with China. Unauthorized copies of the most recent Star Wars film appeared in Beijing shortly after its May release. Pirated films in China often sell for approximately $1, sometimes before official releases. Some studios have implemented measures to prevent piracy, such as simultaneous DVD releases and non-removable subtitles. Additionally, studios are testing lower-priced DVDs to compete with pirated versions. The number of cinema screens in China remains low, with 2,500 screens serving 1.3 billion people, though this is expected to increase. Warner Bros opened its first multiplex in China in 2002 and plans to expand as investment regulations become more flexible."

        "title": "Grisly identity puzzle may be insoluble",
        "original_text": "About 800 bodies will have to be exhumed from Bang Muang temporary cemetery and re-examined because of fears that foreigners may have been mistakenly identified as Thai nationals in the chaos that followed the tsunami. The news will add to the pressure on Tony Blair when he gives a statement to the House of Commons today amid criticism that the government turned down offers of help from UK forensic experts who might have been able to accelerate and improve the process of victim identification in the crucial first few days. So far, 440 Britons are feared dead and another 2,000 are unaccounted for. Many of them are known to have been in Thailand, where more than 8,000 people were killed - half of them foreigners. Despite the largest forensic investigation in history, which has involved pathologists from more than 20 countries, only 50 of the British dead have been found and their identities confirmed. The confusion, which is almost inevitable given that the morgues were largely staffed by student volunteers and holidaymakers in the first days after the tsunami, might have been eased if international specialists had arrived earlier. One of Britain's leading forensic experts urged the Foreign Office to dispatch a large team to Thailand soon after the tsunami, but her suggestion was turned down and a 20-strong UK police team did not arrive until December 30. Professor Sue Black, head of the anatomy and forensic anthropology department at Dundee University and a director of the Centre for International Forensic Assistance (CIFA), told her local newspaper, the Dundee Courier, the offer was greeted with \"a deafening silence\" from the Foreign Office. The Thai authorities estimate it will take at least two months to collate DNA information on the thousands of bodies that have become too bloated or decomposed for visual identification. Many corpses have been washed out to sea and may never be found. The process may have been made more difficult by the preferential treatment given to \"foreign-looking\" bodies. Western corpses have been placed in refrigerated containers at Yanyao temple, the main temporary morgue in the disaster area, where they are being dealt with by team of experts from around the world. Asian-looking bodies are stored two metres underground at the Bang Muang temporary cemetery because there were not enough fridges for everyone and it was feared that leaving corpses in the open would create a health risk. Compared with the bustle of well-equipped teams at Yanyao, Bang Muang is quiet and primitive. Located down a side road 11km from the focus of international attention, it is recognisable by three long trenches of bright-yellow sand bordered by hundreds of stakes bearing the numbers of the victims stored below. There are new arrivals and departures every day. Although police yesterday called off the search for bodies in the ruins of the major tourist hotels, corpses are still being found in and around the poor fishing villages nearby which have only recently received the same level of attention. Thai relatives are also turning up to claim their dead, which involves a half-hour exhumation of the bodies, first by giant earth-movers and then by student and army volunteers with spades. Some are cremated on site in a pyre of rubber tyres. \"I have burned 20 bodies this week,\" said Huang Martthong, the cremator, as he pointed to a blaze 20 metres from the burial trenches. \"This one is being cremated here because the family come from a distant province and they cannot afford to take it back home with them.\" This has led to concerns that some of the bodies burned may not have been identified properly - a criticism denied by the workers at Bang Muang. \"We are very careful,\" said Arunswasdi Bhuridadtpong, head of the volunteer team. \"We know how important it is that everyone gets the right body.\" She claimed that 98% of the 800 bodies at Bang Muang are Thai and the remainder from other Asian nations such as Burma and China. But with the identities still undetermined it is equally possible that they are of Asian descent but resident elsewhere. Karl Kent of the Australian federal police, the top international forensic investigator in Thailand, said this was likely. \"But all of these deceased persons will be exhumed and all of these will be examined.\" Surakiart Sathirathai, Thailand's foreign minister, has also acknowledged that some westerners have been buried. Prof Black could not be con tacted yesterday but her husband, Tom, also a director of the CIFA, told the Independent on Sunday: \"They did have a narrow window in terms of the identification of westerners which wasn't seized upon. We sent letters to the Foreign Office and Home Office and No 10 saying please act and act now. We had two emails back from low civil servants, a holding response. \"People who work in such fields know that in heat and water the identification window is very narrow. By not acting quickly the chance was missed. Vital time was lost.\" He, too, could not be contacted yesterday. Dr Bill Hunt, formerly president of the British Association of Forensic Medicine, said yesterday: \"The problem is collecting specimens [for DNA analysis] rather than doing postmortems on everybody. It may be more a matter for scenes-of-crime experts ... It's all awful but it's [only] a matter of identification.\" The Foreign Office said it had concentrated on sending out police officers with forensic training. \"The main reason we did not take up the CIFA offer,\" a FCO spokeswoman said, \"was that we felt the deployment of officers [was sufficient].\"",
        "debiased_text": "Approximately 800 bodies will need to be exhumed from the Bang Muang temporary cemetery for re-examination due to concerns that some foreigners may have been misidentified as Thai nationals following the tsunami. This development comes as UK Prime Minister Tony Blair prepares to address the House of Commons amid reports that the government declined offers of assistance from UK forensic experts, which could have expedited and improved victim identification in the initial days after the disaster. Currently, 440 Britons are confirmed or presumed dead, with around 2,000 more unaccounted for, many of whom were reportedly in Thailand, where over 8,000 people—half of them foreigners—lost their lives. Despite a large-scale forensic effort involving pathologists from more than 20 countries, only 50 British victims have been identified so far. Early challenges in identification were compounded by limited resources, with morgues initially staffed primarily by student volunteers and holidaymakers. A proposal by a UK forensic expert to send a large team to Thailand was not immediately accepted, and a smaller UK police unit arrived on December 30. Professor Sue Black of Dundee University, who had recommended the deployment, reported that the Foreign Office did not respond to the suggestion. Thai authorities estimate that compiling DNA data on the thousands of bodies—many of which are in advanced stages of decomposition—will take at least two months. Some remains have been lost to the sea. Discrepancies in handling bodies based on appearance have been noted: Western victims were placed in refrigerated containers at Yanyao temple, while Asian-appearing bodies were buried at Bang Muang due to a shortage of refrigeration. At Bang Muang, daily exhumations occur as families claim remains, with some bodies cremated onsite due to logistical constraints. Workers at the site maintain that identification procedures are carefully followed, though concerns about potential misidentifications persist. Karl Kent, an Australian federal police officer leading the international forensic effort in Thailand, stated that all unidentified bodies would be exhumed and re-examined. Thailand’s foreign minister acknowledged that some Western victims may have been buried. Dr. Bill Hunt, former president of the British Association of Forensic Medicine, emphasized that collecting DNA samples, rather than performing full autopsies, was the priority. The UK Foreign Office stated it had prioritized sending trained police officers, explaining that it deemed the offered assistance unnecessary at the time."

        "original_text": "BEIJING -- Although human cases of bird flu are mounting in China, the virus here is currently stable, not mutating toward a form readily transmissible among humans, a top Chinese government scientist said. Shu Yuelong, director of China's national influenza laboratory in Beijing, also said amantadine -- a drug largely discredited when the virus was thought to have grown resistant to it -- may be effective in treating avian influenza in people after all, though that evidence is preliminary. China's Xinhua news agency reported Thursday that a farmer in the country's northeast had tested positive for the H5N1 strain of bird flu, making her China's fifth confirmed human case. Until mid- November, China had said it was free of human cases. Global health authorities seeking to stave off a possible bird-flu pandemic have been monitoring human infections with particular interest. So far, the virus has mainly affected poultry, with only about 70 confirmed human fatalities in five Asian countries since late 2003. Authorities fear the bird-flu virus could mix with a strain of human influenza, swapping chunks of genetic code and spawning a deadly virus that could pass from person to person with the ease of the common cold. Dr. Shu said the virus in China appears to be stable rather than mutating in this way. That jibes with the findings of the World Health Organization in Geneva, which has seen no evidence the bird-flu virus has evolved anywhere in Asia to spread easily from person to person. Birds and humans have different kinds of receptor proteins on the surfaces of their lungs' epithelial cells. The hemagglutinin protein on the surface of the H5N1 virus binds easily to bird cells but not to human cells. That enables the virus to burrow into the avian cells and replicate, accounting for the vast numbers of infected birds around the world. Although H5N1 has only recently been reported in humans in China, and such a mutation still could occur, Dr. Shu said that in viruses isolated from the few human cases in China, there have been no such significant changes in the protein. Also encouraging is the possibility that the antiviral drug amantadine may be more effective at combating bird flu in humans than scientists believed. Amantadine is far more widely available and less expensive than oseltamivir, marketed as Tamiflu by the Swiss drug maker Roche Holding AG. Governments world-wide have been scrambling to stockpile Tamiflu as a hedge against a pandemic. All of the samples of the virus that have been isolated from patients in China would be sensitive to amantadine, Dr. Shu said. Those findings dovetail with research on virus samples that have been taken from patients in Indonesia, according to Hariadi Wibisono, director of vector-borne disease control for the Indonesian Ministry of Health in Jakarta. Those early results have prompted officials in Beijing and Jakarta, as well as WHO officials, to consider whether amantadine eventually may play a role in fighting the disease. Right now, however, there are too few samples to draw any firm conclusions. \"If we tested a hundred isolates, and most of them were sensitive, we might recommend amantadine and oseltamivir to treat human cases of avian influenza,\" Dr. Shu said. Meanwhile, in Thailand, a five-year-old boy became Thailand's second bird-flu fatality in two months, the Associated Press reported. Thai health authorities said Friday that lab tests showed the boy died from the H5N1 strain of bird flu. The boy fell ill Nov. 25 at his home in a district of Nakhon Nayok province about 40 miles northeast of Bangkok. He was hospitalized nine days later and died Wednesday.",
        "debiased_text": "BEIJING -- Human cases of bird flu in China have increased, with a fifth confirmed case reported in the country's northeast, according to China's Xinhua news agency. Shu Yuelong, director of China's national influenza laboratory, stated that the virus currently shows no signs of mutating into a form easily transmissible among humans. He also noted preliminary evidence suggesting that the antiviral drug amantadine may be effective against avian influenza in humans, though further research is needed. Since late 2003, approximately 70 human fatalities from bird flu have been confirmed across five Asian countries, with the virus primarily affecting poultry. Health authorities remain concerned about the potential for the virus to combine with human influenza strains, creating a more transmissible form. However, the World Health Organization has found no evidence of such evolution occurring in Asia. The H5N1 virus binds more readily to avian cells than human cells, limiting its current spread. While amantadine could offer a more accessible treatment alternative compared to oseltamivir (Tamiflu), officials emphasize that more testing is required before firm recommendations can be made. In Thailand, a five-year-old boy confirmed to have died from H5N1 marks the country's second bird-flu fatality in two months, according to the Associated Press. The boy fell ill on November 25 and died after being hospitalized in early December."

        "original_text": "China has embarked on a more pro-active campaign to counter criticism in the US of its growing economic and military power, using the visit of a senior official to Washington to make the case in public for a strategic relationship and employing a top US lobbying firm to communicate with Congress. Addressing a meeting of the US-China Business Council yesterday, Tang Jiaxuan, state councillor, said: \"Let us take a long view from a strategic plane when looking at and handling China US relations.\" China would \"gradually\" address US concerns over the trade deficit and intellectual property rights, and allow it greater access to services, he said. \"All this will mean boundless opportunities for US businesses,\" he added. Mr Tang, a key figure in Chinese efforts to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions, yesterday also met Condoleezza Rice, US secretary of state. Talks focused on trade issues, preparations for a summit meeting in September between presidents George W. Bush and Hu Jintao, as well as the crisis over North Korea. In his address to the business council Mr Tang reiterated Chinese demands that the US give China full market economy status, lift restrictions on commodity and technology exports \"and correct the wrong practices of trade protectionism\". While he made a strong case for how the US and China must develop a strategic relationship in the face of common global threats, US lawmakers were passing a measure that would allow US companies to seek tariffs on unfairly subsidised Chinese imports. The bill had been temporarily blocked by Democrats on Tuesday. This weekend Robert Zoellick, deputy secretary of state, will travel to Beijing to inaugurate what China is calling a \"strategic dialogue\". The US prefers the term \"senior dialogue\" in deference to the more elevated \"strategic\" tag it reserves in Asia for Japan and Australia. Seeking to build political influence in Washington, the Chinese embassy has retained Patton Boggs to lobby on a wide range of issues before Congress, according to a lobbying registration statement filed last week with the US Department of Justice. The enlistment of Patton Boggs - which has also represented such countries as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Pakistan - highlights China's efforts to respond to the rising wave of anti-Chinese sentiment in Congress. Beyond trade, the ill-feeling is also driven by Chinese threats towards Taiwan and China's rapid military expansion, which was highlighted this month by a special Pentagon report mandated by Congress. Over the past two years, China has significantly expanded its presence in Washington, with Chinese government ministries and even provincial governments hiring several prominent lobbying firms to work on trade issues in particular. China's state controlled CNOOC has hired Akin Gump and Public Strategies, a well-connected communications firm, to try to fend off congressional concerns over its bid for US oil company Unocal.",

        "title": "North and South Korea to join forces in fight for Olympic gold",
        "original_text": "North and South Korea will re-unite at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 by fielding a joint team for the first time since the troubled peninsula was divided 60 years ago. The sporting union, which was announced yesterday, is the most symbolic in a recent series of moves toward rapprochement across the world's last cold war border. Seoul and Pyongyang have yet to sign a peace treaty since the bloody 1950-53 Korean war, which claimed millions of lives on both sides. They have been bitter sporting as well as political rivals. North Korea boycotted the 1988 Seoul Olympics and football matches between the two countries have often caused security concerns. But the atmosphere has warmed considerably since a summit between the countries' leaders in 2000. Teams from the two marched together at the Sydney and Athens Olympics, and at the opening ceremony of the East Asia Games, now under way in Macau. But apart from a brief experiment in table tennis and football in the 90s, athletes from the two sides have been rivals rather than teammates. Sporting officials from the two countries said it was now time to take a step forward, first by fielding a joint team at the next Asian Games and then at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. \"We had discussed making a single team since we jointly marched in such international events six times,\" Baek Sung-il, a spokesman for South Korea's Olympic Committee, told Reuters. \"As exchanges between South and North Korea have been progressing, the mood was ripe for reaching such an agreement.\" The two sides issued a joint statement that said they would meet on December 7 in the North's border city of Kaesong to discuss how to select and train athletes. If chosen on sporting rather than political grounds, the team is likely to have a strong South Korean bias. Athletes in the impoverished North are disadvantaged by a lack of facilities and - for much of the past decade - food shortages. At the Athens games, South Korea won 30 medals, including nine golds, while North Korea won only four silvers and one bronze. They won medals in featherweight boxing, women's singles table tennis and women's weightlifting. On both sides of the border there is a desire to score diplomatic points against the US ahead of the next round of six-nation nuclear talks later this month. Despite concerns about Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme, most South Koreans believe the US - a traditional ally - has become a greater threat to peace than North Korea. South Korea has stepped up supplies of food and economic aid to its impoverished neighbour. Tens of thousands of tourists from the South have crossed the border this year. Test runs are expected to begin soon on a railway linking the two capitals. Last month, the South Korean government opened its first office in the North since the two sides were divided along the 38th parallel. The fielding of a joint team at the next Olympics would be the clearest declaration to the outside world of the improved relations. It would also be a coup for the host, China, which has led efforts to defuse tensions on the peninsula. · The North Korean leader Kim Jong-il is urging workers to produce more bicycles to cope with the lack of transport, improve people's health and prevent pollution just days after the country's first bike factory opened, Reuters reports. North Korea's official KCNA news agency reported on Monday that Mr Kim visited the Pyongyang Joint Venture Bicycle Factory. Previously most bikes have been cast-offs from China and Japan.",
        "debiased_text": "North Korea and South Korea will form a joint team for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, marking the first combined team since the division of the Korean Peninsula 60 years ago. The agreement was announced as part of recent diplomatic efforts between the two countries, which have not signed a peace treaty since the 1950-53 Korean War. The two nations have historically competed separately in sports, with North Korea boycotting the 1988 Seoul Olympics and previous matches prompting security concerns. However, relations have improved since a 2000 summit, leading to joint marches at the Sydney and Athens Olympics and the East Asia Games. Apart from limited collaborations in table tennis and football in the 1990s, athletes from both countries have primarily competed against each other. Officials from both sides stated that the next step involves forming a joint team for the upcoming Asian Games and later the 2008 Olympics. A December 7 meeting is scheduled in Kaesong, North Korea, to discuss athlete selection and training. Performance disparities exist between the two nations, with South Korea winning 30 medals at the Athens Olympics compared to North Korea's five. Diplomatic efforts are ongoing, coinciding with upcoming six-nation nuclear talks. South Korea has increased economic aid and tourism to the North, and plans for a cross-border railway are progressing. Additionally, North Korea recently opened its first bicycle factory, as reported by KCNA, to address transportation needs."

        "original_text": "Beijing -- A WEALTHY senior partner at a big law firm here says he barely blinked at spending $70,000 on an imported BMW and more than $12,000 on a gold Jaeger-LeCoultre watch. But last year when the attorney, Mr. Zhuang, was suffering from migraine headaches, he had to brave long lines and brusque service to see a doctor at a state-run hospital. The cost? Six dollars. Mr. Zhuang, who declined to give his first name because of concerns about notoriety, would have jumped at the chance to pay a lot more for medical care that was more convenient and more comfortable. So late last year he did: He signed up for a private health program offered by Beijing Universal Medical Assistance Co., a unit of China Healthcare Holdings of Hong Kong. Now, he pays an annual fee of $3,700 and in return gets regular checkups, appointments with private physicians and, when necessary, access to some of the country's best hospitals -- all extraordinary luxuries compared with what is available to most people in China. Crowded, dingy rooms and hasty exams at state hospitals were once the only option for rich, poor and middle-class patients alike in China. But now, private health care is starting to gain a toehold here, available to those wealthy enough to afford membership programs and high fees at for-profit clinics and hospitals. \"A growing number of well-to-do Chinese want international-standard health care and are prepared to pay handsomely for it,\" says Roberta Lipson, chief executive of Chindex International Inc., a Bethesda, Md., company that operates two swank, immaculate hospitals, in Beijing and Shanghai, under a joint venture with the Chinese government. Chindex's Beijing United Family Hospital, which opened in 1997 to serve the expanding population of expatriates, derives more than a third of its $22 million in annual revenue from Chinese patients, Ms. Lipson says. For the most part, private clinics and hospitals don't yet offer big-ticket procedures, such as heart surgery or cancer treatment. For these, even wealthy patients continue to rely on state hospitals. Beijing United, for example, has only 50 beds and refers candidates for brain and heart surgery to local state-run hospitals. But when it comes to primary health care, the state hospitals can't compete with private providers for wealthy patients. \"The basic medical services cannot satisfy the needs of the rich people,\" says Steve Chen, a 35-year-old Beijing lawyer who says he earned about $250,000 last year. He recently signed up for a Beijing Universal Medical Assistance program offering him and his family primary medical care at an annual cost of around $12,400. \"The demand is there,\" says Robert W. Pollard, director in China for the health-care arm of Synovate, a global market-research firm. China's health-care system once was a standout in a sea of communist failures, delivering basic, near-universal care. But today, its state- run hospitals are ill-equipped to deliver the kind of private, convenient primary care that patients in the West take for granted. On a recent afternoon at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, one of Beijing's best-known state hospitals, hundreds of people waited in a tangle of long lines, maneuvering around a woman lying motionless on a stretcher on the floor. A sign on a wall listed prices: one yuan (12 cents) to see a regular doctor, 10 yuan for a specialist. Appointments at state hospitals are rare. It isn't uncommon for wealthy patients to have assistants or drivers camp out overnight for a good spot in line. In contrast, Mr. Zhuang recently headed to a medical appointment at a posh Beijing clinic outfitted with faux French paintings, a giant flat-screen TV set and a miniature waterfall. \"I need to stay healthy to make more money,\" he says. At such high-end facilities, patients sometimes pay with bags of cash. For Western companies, the barriers to entering the Chinese health- care market are considerable. Foreign investors may own as much as a 70% stake in a Chinese hospital, but they have to navigate a maze of regulatory obstacles before breaking ground on a new facility. Only 11% of China's 12,902 general hospitals are run for profit, and the vast majority of these operate under government-imposed price caps with local Chinese owners and without foreign investment. But as Beijing relaxes investment restrictions, opportunities for private providers could multiply. Total health-care expenditures in China exceeded $80 billion in 2003, according to the Ministry of Health. Out-of-pocket payments by individuals are a growing portion. Cindy He, a 34-year-old manager at the Beijing office of a U.S. company she declined to name, is a client of China's new high-end providers. She came of age in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution in Xi'an, where her mother worked in state-run factories. Now, Ms. He reads Vogue and spends $100 for a perm. She recalls the time she got a fish bone stuck in her throat and paid a doctor at a state hospital a little more than a dollar to get it out. Two years ago, when she found tiny spots along her jaw line, she had to wait all morning to see a doctor -- only to discover, upon entering the examination room, that the session would take place in front of other patients. So Ms. He decided to try Beijing United Family Hospital, even though the cost of a doctor's visit would be more than 50 times that at a state-run hospital. \"It's not just that I can afford it,\" Ms. He says. \"There's something intangible. It's a bit about the status.\" On a recent dentist visit at the hospital, she bumped into a Chinese pop star. Suning Fang is married to an investment banker at Goldman Sachs Group and pays $18,000 a year to send her 5-year-old son, Wesley, to kindergarten. She recently took him to a private hospital to be circumcised and have his tonsils removed. The bill came to more than $7,000 -- a significant sum, even for someone of her means. She paid with a credit card. But when she discovered a lump in her breast and required surgery, she checked into a state hospital. \"It's fine for me,\" Ms. Fang says. \"But for my son, no way. I don't care how much it costs.\"",

Roberta Lipson, CEO of Chindex International, noted that Beijing United Family Hospital, which opened in 1997, receives over a third of its $22 million annual revenue from Chinese patients. The hospital, jointly operated with the Chinese government, primarily serves expatriates but is increasingly catering to wealthy locals. Private hospitals in China generally do not perform major surgeries, such as heart or cancer treatments, meaning patients still rely on state hospitals for these services. Beijing United Family Hospital, for instance, has 50 beds and refers complex cases to state-run hospitals. However, private facilities compete for affluent patients seeking primary care. Steve Chen, a Beijing lawyer earning approximately $250,000 annually, enrolled his family in a $12,400-per-year private healthcare program. According to Robert W. Pollard of Synovate, demand exists among wealthy Chinese for higher-standard medical services. China’s healthcare system, once providing near-universal basic care, now struggles to meet expectations for private, convenient services. At Peking Union Medical College Hospital, a state facility, patients often wait in long lines without appointments. Fees are listed at one yuan (12 cents) for general practitioners and 10 yuan for specialists. Wealthier patients sometimes employ assistants to secure priority. In contrast, Mr. Zhuang visited a private clinic with amenities such as decor, a large TV, and a waterfall. Some patients pay in cash at these facilities. Foreign investment in China’s healthcare sector faces regulatory hurdles. Foreign investors may hold up to 70% stakes in hospitals but must navigate approvals before construction. Only 11% of China’s 12,902 general hospitals operate as for-profit entities, with most subject to government price controls and domestic ownership. However, as investment restrictions ease, opportunities for private providers may expand. China’s healthcare spending exceeded $80 billion in 2003, with out-of-pocket payments rising. Cindy He, a manager at a U.S. company in Beijing, switched to private healthcare after an unsatisfactory state hospital visit where she was examined in front of others. She now uses Beijing United Family Hospital despite higher costs. During a dental visit there, she encountered a Chinese celebrity. Suning Fang, whose child attends a $18,000-per-year kindergarten, paid $7,000 for her son’s private hospital procedures but chose a state hospital for her own breast surgery. She stated a preference for private care for her child regardless of cost."

        "title": "US uneasy as Beijing develops a strategic string of pearls",
        "original_text": "There is an air of El Dorado about Gwadar, a fishing village on the Persian Sea with dreams of becoming a glittering metropolis. Advertising billboards along the rubbish-strewn streets feature digitised images of skyscrapers and tourist-clogged beaches. Offices with names like Gold Mine Investments and New World City have sprung up overnight. Property prices have risen up to 30-fold, turning poor fishermen into small-time tycoons with four-wheel drives and second wives. Dealers such as Kamran Ali, 25, have flooded in from the big cities. \"In five years' time this will be like Dubai, or parts of Europe,\" he said. Or, possibly, Beijing. Gwadar's ambitious plans hinge on a giant deepwater port whose money, bricks and mortar come from China. Last year 400 Chinese labourers worked 24-hour shifts to complete the project, intended to serve Afghanistan and Central Asia. Through cheap loans and generous grants the Chinese government covered 80% of the $250m (£144m) cost. Now a dredger is out in the bay carving a deep channel that will accommodate cargo ships, oil tankers and, if necessary, warships. A high-stakes geopolitical game is sweeping Asia. Triggered by a roaring economy, propelled by swelling confidence and funded by chequebook diplomacy, Beijing is projecting its new might across the continent - and setting off alarm bells from Washington to Tokyo. \"There is a cauldron of anxiety about China,\" the US deputy secretary of state, Robert Zoellick, said in September. In May China signed a $600m deal with the president of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, 12 days after his troops killed hundreds of protesters. Relations are warming with former enemies seeking a bulwark against US might. In August almost 10,000 Chinese and Russian forces took part in a joint exercise. In Pakistan an old friendship is being rekindled. China helped to build Pakistan's weapons plants and, according to western intelligence, had a hand in its nuclear bomb. The two countries' friendship is \"higher than the Himalayas and deeper than the ocean\", according to popular cliche. Now it is driven by a fresh impetus - increased cooperation between Islamabad's enemy, India, and China's rival, America. \"It's a classic case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend,\" said Dr Rifaat Hussain, director of the army-run Institute for Strategic Studies and Research Analysis in Islamabad. This year the two countries signed 22 trade agreements, including the joint production of a jet fighter, and the sale of four Chinese navy frigates to Pakistan. But in Gwadar, China insists, its interest is purely commercial. The port has a great commercial attraction. It lies 1,250 miles from Xinjiang, a landlocked western province and latecomer to China's economic boom. From next year Beijing hopes for a fresh flow of traffic across the Himalayas and down to the Persian Sea. But Gwadar also has an immense strategic lure. It lies close to the Straits of Hormuz, the gateway to the Gulf through which 40% of the world's oil passes. Most Chinese oil supplies pass through the Malacca Straits, thousands of the miles to the south, that Beijing perceives as US controlled. To counter this vulnerability Beijing has adopted the \"string of pearls\" policy - cultivating commercial or military ties in strategic ports from the Gulf to the east coast of China. Gwadar is the first pearl in a line that stretches to Bangladesh, Cambodia and into the South China Sea. The Pentagon is watching uneasily. China's military is modernising rapidly. One US military report claimed the Chinese navy was beefing up to \"deter the potential disruption of its energy supplies from potential threats, including the US navy, especially in the case of a conflict with Taiwan\". China dismisses such talk as scaremongering. The dragon does not breathe fire, Premier Wen Jiabao told a meeting of Asian ministers in Islamabad last April. \"Even if we become stronger and more developed, we will not stand in the way of others, still less become a threat,\" he said. Other analysts say a purely military analysis ignores the wider picture of China's political reforms, embrace of international trade and normalisation of relations with the west. When the first ships sail into Gwadar by the end of next year it will not be used by any military, Chinese or otherwise, according to Akbar Ali Pesnani, chairman of the Gwadar port authority: \"It's a strictly commercial venture.\" Chinese officials brush aside claims they will use Gwadar to monitor sea traffic passing into the Middle East. Their main future involvement with the port is an offer of help in building a railway link across Pakistan towards their own borders, they say. Even then, there is no guarantee Gwadar will succeed. Most access roads are still on the drawing board; property development has been marred by fraud and speculation; land prices dipped sharply recently, causing some estate agents to leave town. \"We give it a 50/50 chance of success,\" said one western diplomat in Islamabad. However, China's enthusiasm is undiminished, despite running into bloody local opposition. In May 2004 a car bomb in Gwadar killed three Chinese engineers working on the port and injured 11. Intelligence services suspected local nationalists. But elsewhere optimism is tinged with apprehension. \"China has to turn to the international resource supply system, and will seek military force to safeguard its share when necessary,\" wrote Zhang Wenmy of the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations this year. \"There has never been a case in history where such a pursuit was realised in peace.\"",
        "debiased_text": "Gwadar, a fishing town located on the Persian Sea, is undergoing significant development with aspirations to become a major urban center. Along its streets, billboards display digital renderings of future skyscrapers and busy beaches. New businesses, including Gold Mine Investments and New World City, have recently appeared. Property values have increased significantly, some reportedly by up to 30 times, leading to economic changes for local residents. Individuals such as Kamran Ali, 25, have moved to Gwadar from larger cities to participate in this growth. Ali predicts Gwadar could resemble Dubai or parts of Europe in five years. The town’s development is largely tied to a deepwater port project primarily funded by China, which contributed 80% of the $250 million cost. Last year, 400 Chinese workers were involved in round-the-clock construction. Currently, dredging operations are underway to prepare the port for cargo ships, oil tankers, and potential military vessels. Gwadar’s strategic location near the Strait of Hormuz, a key route for global oil shipments, adds to its significance. China’s involvement in Gwadar is part of a broader pattern of infrastructure investments across Asia, including agreements with Uzbekistan and joint military exercises with Russia. In Pakistan, China has been a long-standing partner, collaborating on defense projects and, according to Western intelligence, nuclear programs. Recent trade agreements between China and Pakistan include joint production of a jet fighter and the sale of naval frigates. Chinese officials maintain their interest in Gwadar is commercial, focused on fostering trade connections, including a potential rail link to China’s landlocked Xinjiang region. However, analysts note the port’s geopolitical implications, as China seeks to secure energy supply routes. The U.S. has expressed concerns over China’s expanding military capabilities, particularly regarding energy security and potential tensions over Taiwan. Chinese leadership has dismissed these concerns, emphasizing peaceful development and international cooperation. Despite the port’s commercial designation by Gwadar port authority chairman Akbar Ali Pesnani, speculation persists about its long-term use. Challenges to Gwadar’s development remain, including incomplete infrastructure and fluctuations in the real estate market. A 2004 attack in Gwadar, which killed three Chinese engineers, highlights local tensions. While some analysts suggest China may use military measures to protect resources if necessary, the country’s leadership reiterates a commitment to peaceful growth."

        "title": "IRA blamed for £22m Belfast bank raid",
        "original_text": "The Provisional IRA was responsible for the £22m Belfast bank raid, the chief constable of Northern Ireland said today. Hugh Orde told a Belfast press conference that the terrorist group - linked to Sinn Féin, which is negotiating to share power with the Democratic Unionists - was \"responsible, and all main lines of inquiry lead in that direction\". The news has thrown the province's fragile peace process into disarray. The implication is that the IRA was planning the robbery, one of the largest bank jobs in history, as Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness negotiated a power-sharing deal with the Democratic Unionists. Downing Street immediately said that the prime minister, Tony Blair, took the development \"very seriously\". \"The PM has made it repeatedly clear over the past two years that the political institutions in Northern Ireland can only be restored if there is a complete end to all paramilitary activity by those involved, and that includes all criminal activity,\" a spokesman said. \"He fully supports the chief constable in his efforts to bring those responsible for this major crime to account.\" Mr McGuinness, Sinn Féin's chief negotiator, responded by saying that the police did not have \"one scrap of evidence\" that the IRA were involved. He said Mr Orde had made unfounded, \"politically biased\" allegations. Mr Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, led the pre-Christmas power-sharing negotiations, which foundered on Sinn Féin's refusal to comply with the DUP's demand for IRA weapons decommissioning to be photographed. The Northern Ireland secretary, Paul Murphy, who will brief MPs on developments when parliament returns next week, said the revelation virtually destroyed any chance of a political agreement before the next general election. \"I think it is unlikely that we will be able to get a resolution along the lines of what we agreed back before Christmas. I do not think that is realistic between now and the election.\" But he went on: \"I do not think it is the end of the process, I don't think for one second that is the case. We have gone too far down the line for that. \"The feeling I have, which I guess is shared overwhelmingly by the people of Ireland, north and south, is one of great disappointment. We were hoping before Christmas for a real breakthrough, we were nearly there and this has obviously affected the possibility of that very seriously indeed.\" Mr Murphy said no decision had yet been taken on whether to apply sanctions to Sinn Féin. The Irish taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, called the news \"a serious setback\" for the peace process. \"It underscores the need for compelling commitments both in word and deed that the full spectrum of IRA paramilitary activities and capability has been brought to a definitive closure,\" he said. The Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, whose party was overtaken by Reverend Ian Paisley's DUP in last year's elections, urged Mr Blair to ban Sinn Féin from any future Stormont Assembly. \"Gerry Adams has betrayed the prime minister personally,\" he said. Ian Paisley Jr, the son of the DUP leader, reacted to Mr Orde's announcement by saying that Sinn Féin was \"finished\" in the power-sharing negotiations. \"IRA behind the crime of the century. It's over for Sinn Féin, and we must move on without them.\" Mr Paisley Jr said Mr Blair had already spoken to his father today, and that more talks were planned for next week. \"The PM must feel suckered again,\" he said. Mr Orde revealed that Northern Bank, the victim of the robbery, would be withdrawing all its banknotes and replacing them with differently coloured ones, making the robbery \"the largest theft of waste paper in history\". The chief constable made it clear that the implications of his announcement were \"a matter for politics and politicians\". But, he said, \"this was not a victimless crime. Two families were kidnapped, and people were threatened with death. It was a violent and brutal crime, committed by violent and dangerous criminals. It was not some Robin Hood effort.\" Mr McGuinness told a brief news conference in Belfast that there was an agenda by the government and \"securocrats\" to try to \"criminalise and marginalise\" Sinn Féin and stop the peace process. But he said republicanism would not be cowed. \"We have told both the British and Irish governments that Sinn Féin will not countenance any attempt by the DUP, or by the governments or by anyone else, to demonise this party,\" said the former education minister of the suspended Stormont executive. Mr McGuinness said that after the allegations were made he met with a high-ranking IRA figure who assured him the IRA was not involved. Fellow Sinn Féin assembly member Gerry Kelly dismissed Mr Orde's statement as merely \"an opinion\". Mr Murphy is expected to meet the Irish foreign minister, Dermot Ahern, next week, while Mr Blair will hold talks after the Irish prime minister returns from a trip to China. Downing Street said the incident would be referred to the Independent Monitoring Commission, set up to examine any continuing activity by paramilitary groups. The Northern Bank's decision to withdraw its currency is understood to involve the withdrawal of up to £300m in paper currency after talks with police chiefs. All existing £10, £20, £50 and £100 notes will be replaced with new ones, a process which will cost £5m. It will be eight weeks before the new notes are in circulation. \"All new notes will be of the same design as the old ones, but will be printed in a different colour, feature a new Northern Bank logo and bear new prefixes to their serial numbers,\" a bank statement said.",
        "debiased_text": "The chief constable of Northern Ireland, Hugh Orde, stated today that the Provisional IRA was responsible for the £22m Belfast bank raid.

Downing Street confirmed that Prime Minister Tony Blair views the development seriously, reiterating that political institutions in Northern Ireland require a complete cessation of paramilitary and criminal activity. A spokesperson emphasized Blair's support for the chief constable's efforts to hold those responsible accountable. Sinn Féin's chief negotiator, Martin McGuinness, denied the allegations, stating there was no evidence of IRA involvement and accusing Orde of politically biased claims. The recent pre-Christmas power-sharing negotiations, led by Blair and Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, stalled over Sinn Féin's refusal to photograph IRA weapons decommissioning as demanded by the DUP. Northern Ireland Secretary Paul Murphy stated the revelation could hinder a political agreement before the next general election but stressed the peace process was not concluded. Murphy noted widespread disappointment but confirmed no decision had been made on potential sanctions against Sinn Féin. Bertie Ahern described the situation as a serious setback for the peace process, emphasizing the need for verifiable commitments to end all IRA activities. Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble urged Blair to exclude Sinn Féin from future Stormont assemblies. DUP member Ian Paisley Jr. asserted that Sinn Féin's role in negotiations was effectively over. Orde confirmed the Northern Bank would replace its currency with differently colored notes to invalidate stolen funds, calling the robbery a violent crime involving kidnappings and death threats. McGuinness accused the government and security officials of attempting to marginalize Sinn Féin, vowing the party would resist demonization. Sinn Féin's Gerry Kelly dismissed Orde's statement as an opinion.

The move is Microsoft's latest in a recent flurry in China. Microsoft agreed to invest as much as $20 million, and IFC as much as $15 million, in Chinasoft, a Hong Kong-listed Chinese information- technology company. \"We believe that this investment and the ongoing strategic partnership will help Chinasoft, a key software technology and service provider in China, to play an increasingly important role both in China and the world market,\" said Tim Chen, chief executive of Microsoft's Greater China operations. The IFC's associate director for East Asia and the Pacific region, Karin Finkelston, said the organization's support for Chinasoft would help the software company \"increase its global profile and governance.\" Chinasoft counts state-owned China National Software & Services Co. as one of its largest shareholders. The company provides software services mainly to government departments. Chinasoft will use the investment to develop its core business capabilities and accelerate its expansion into international markets, according to the announcement. The investment \"is part of our commitment made . . . in 2002 to support China's software industry,\" Microsoft said in a statement, referring to a 2002 pledge by the company to invest 6.2 billion yuan ($766 million) in China. In May, Microsoft announced the formation of two new ventures for its MSN Internet service in China, saying the development would allow it to offer \"the full gamut of a true Internet portal\" in the market. One of those ventures involved its acquisition of assets from a provider of software for mobile phones, as it sought to tap the country's vast market of 370 million mobile-phone users. In July, Microsoft also agreed to invest $25 million in Hong Kong- listed Lang Chao International Ltd., a unit of Lang Chao Group of China. A former company vice president, Kai-Fu Lee, said in testimony this month that his recent departure from Microsoft came after becoming frustrated with the company's approach to China. Mr. Lee, 43 years old, had established Microsoft's research-and- development center in Beijing. His testimony came during a lawsuit by Microsoft in the U.S. aiming to stop Mr. Lee from working for rival Google Inc. on the grounds that he possessed confidential information from his time working at Microsoft. A judge finally cleared the way for Mr. Lee to work for Google in China but placed tough restrictions on confidential information he had gleaned while working for Microsoft.",

        "original_text": "A U.S. company said it agreed with Chinese car maker Chery Automobile Co. to bring Chery vehicles to the U.S. market by 2007, in what would be the largest scale effort yet to bring Chinese-made vehicles to the U.S. Visionary Vehicles LLC, founded by automobile entrepreneur Malcolm Bricklin, said yesterday that the company plans to launch sales of five Chery models by 2007, and is aiming for prices 30% lower than comparable vehicles. Mr. Bricklin said he is looking for 250 U.S. dealers. Mr. Bricklin, who brought Subaru and later the Yugo to America, said the Chery vehicles are being \"designed from the ground up\" with an aim for export to the U.S. The Yugo -- a small, ultracheap hatchback made in the former Yugoslavia that Mr. Bricklin tried to sell in the U.S. more than a decade ago -- flopped because of poor quality. Mr. Bricklin also said New York investment bank Allen & Co. is acting as its financial adviser. The Detroit News reported the agreement yesterday. While established auto makers have discussed plans to export vehicles from China, so far those efforts have been relatively small in part because of concerns about the cost and quality of Chinese-made cars, and in part because until relatively recently, booming Chinese demand left auto makers little capacity to supply export markets. The prospect of cheap, Chinese-made cars coming to the U.S. has been a worry for U.S. auto makers and their unionized workers for some time. But Visionary Vehicles, based in New York, and Chery could face a number of obstacles, among them persuading American consumers that the Chinese-made vehicles are as well-made and safe as new and used models from more-established brands. Mr. Bricklin said the Chery cars will come with 10-year, 100,000-mile warranties. Representatives for Chery couldn't be reached. But a senior Chery executive said last year that they were gearing up to export vehicles from China, including to the U.S. market, by enlisting a number of outside suppliers to help create vehicles that meet Western standards. Chery, China's eighth-largest car maker, is an independent upstart in the Chinese market, which is dominated by joint ventures between established Western and Japanese auto makers and government-controlled auto makers. Last month, the Korean affiliate of U.S. auto giant General Motors Corp. sued Chery in Chinese court, accusing the company of pirating the design for the QQ from GM and its Daewoo Automotive and Technology unit.

        "original_text": "If only he could show us the memo.\n\"It's still classified, I suppose?\" says Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, looking toward his assistant.\n\"It's still classified,\" Lawrence DiRita replies, \"along with a lot of the underlying planning.\"\nRumsfeld nods, apparently disappointed. He is interested in sharing the memo because the memo, as he outlines it, demonstrates that his critics are utterly mistaken. He did not dash heedless and underprepared into Iraq. Rumsfeld foresaw the things that could go wrong -- and not just foresaw them, but wrote them up in a classically Rumsfeldian list, one brisk bullet point after another, 29 potential pitfalls in all. Then he distributed the memo at the highest levels, fed it into the super-secret planning process and personally walked the president through the warnings.\n\"It would have been probably October of '02, and the war was March, I think,\" of the following year, Rumsfeld explains. \"I sat down, and I said, 'What are all the things that one has to anticipate could be a problem?' And circulated it and read it to the president -- sent it to the president. Gave it to the people in the department, and they planned against those things. And all of the likely and unlikely things that one could imagine are listed there. It was just on the off-chance we'd end up having a conflict. We didn't know at that stage.\"\nSome might quibble with Rumsfeld's description of the historical moment. At the time he wrote the memo, dated October 15, 2002, Congress had recently voted to give President Bush complete authority to invade Iraq and topple Saddam Hussein. A White House spokesman had just confirmed that invasion plans were on Bush's desk -- detailed plans, we now know, which Rumsfeld had been shaping and hammering and editing for much of the previous year.\nIn other words, there was far more than an \"off-chance\" of conflict. All that remained to be done was for the president to reach his official decision. The train was loaded, its doors were shut, and it was ready to leave the station.\nRumsfeld never pretended there was anything off-chancy about the timing of the memo when he discussed it with Bob Woodward, who wrote about the document in his authoritative history of Iraq war preparations, Plan of Attack. In that account, Rumsfeld portrayed the memo as a warning blast, an attempt to do \"everything humanly possible to prepare\" Bush for the awful responsibility that had settled onto his presidential shoulders -- and his shoulders alone. For there comes a point when even the secretary of defense must realize that \"it's not your decision or even your recommendation,\" Rumsfeld reflected with Woodward. By which he meant the Iraq war wasn't Don Rumsfeld's decision or recommendation.\nAs if to underline the point, Rumsfeld also told Woodward that he couldn't recall a moment, in all the months of planning for the war, when Bush asked whether his defense secretary favored the invasion. Nor did Rumsfeld ever volunteer his opinion. (\"There's no question in anyone's mind but I agreed with the president's approach,\" he added.) So what was in the memo? Dire scenarios ranging from disasters that did not happen, such as chemical warfare and house- to-house combat with Saddam's troops in Baghdad, to bad things that have indeed come to pass, such as ethnic strife among Iraq's religious factions and the successful exploitation of the war as a public relations vehicle for the enemies of the United States.\nRumsfeld raises the subject of this memo near the end of an interview in his spacious Pentagon office. Outside the tinted blast- proof windows and across the Potomac, a brutal summer sun bakes the domes and cornices of Washington, but Rumsfeld is wearing a fleece vest over his shirtsleeves. He often finds his office chilly. Rumsfeld appears relaxed, charming, expansive. It seems awfully helpful of him to want to share a classified memo written expressly for the president of the United States, who was wrestling with his awesome power to wage war.",
        "debiased_text": "Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld referenced a classified memo during an interview. When asked if it remained classified, his assistant, Lawrence DiRita, confirmed that it was, along with related planning documents. Rumsfeld indicated he wished to share the memo to show that his critics were mistaken about his approach to Iraq. He said the memo listed 29 potential challenges that could arise and that he had circulated it among senior officials and discussed it with President George W. Bush. Rumsfeld stated the memo was written in October 2002, months before the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, as a precautionary measure. At the time the memo was written, Congress had authorized military action against Iraq, and detailed invasion plans were reportedly under review by the president. Rumsfeld had previously discussed the memo with journalist Bob Woodward, describing it as an effort to prepare the president for potential outcomes of military action. According to Woodward's account, Rumsfeld said he did not recall being asked for his personal recommendation on the invasion. The memo reportedly outlined various risks, some of which did not occur, such as chemical warfare, and others that did, such as sectarian violence. The interview took place in Rumsfeld's Pentagon office, where he appeared at ease during the discussion."

        "original_text": "Japan has raised the possibility of exploring for oil and gas around the Senkaku islands, where sovereignty is contested by Japan, China and Taiwan, in a move that appears aimed at raising the stakes in Tokyo's dispute with Beijing over energy resources. Tokyo recently earmarked Y10bn (Dollars 97m, Euros 74m) for construction of the country's first ship capable of doing 3-D seismic mapping of the ocean floor. A government official said Japan wanted to build the ship, which would not be finished until 2008, so it could survey the Senkaku islands, north-east of Taiwan. He said Tokyo could hire a foreign vessel to conduct tests but would be reluctant to send a non-Japanese vessel into such strongly disputed territory. Raising the idea of exploring the Senkakus, called the Diaoyus in China, is the latest escalation in a dispute over energy and territory in the East China Sea. The official said: \"We are pursuing a policy of proportional escalation. If they do something, then we'll do something until they understand our determination.\" Japan has protested at China's exploitation of the Chunxiao gas field, 4km on China's side of the line dividing the two countries' exclusive economic zones. Tokyo is worried that this could suck gas from Japan's side of the boundary, a line not recognised by China, and is negotiating with two Japanese companies to start drilling in the area. Tsutomo Toichi, managing director at the Institute of Energy Economics in Tokyo, said Japan was stepping up seismic exploration of the East China Sea. He also said China had been building a production platform for the Chunxiao field, and that it could start pumping gas to Shanghai as early as summer. Tokyo would find it hard to justify exploiting gas around Chunxiao on economic grounds because of its distance from Honshu, Japan's main island. Its actions were intended more as an assertion of territorial rights, experts said. But officials believe the field might also contain oil, which is easier to transport. A sign that the territorial issue is creeping up the political agenda came this week, when Shintaro Ishihara, governor of Tokyo, said Chinese survey ships were encroaching on Japan's exclusive economic zone near Okinotori island, 1,740km south of Tokyo but officially under its jurisdiction. Mr Ishihara told Junichiro Koizumi, prime minister, that he would like to build a power station on the deserted island, designated as a mere \"rock\" by China, as a way of underlining Japan's presence in the area. Japan has also sparred with China over the direction of a Russian oil pipeline to be built by Transneft. See Commodities",
        "debiased_text": "Japan has announced plans to explore for oil and gas near the Senkaku Islands, a region where Japan, China, and Taiwan have competing sovereignty claims. The Japanese government has allocated 10 billion yen (approximately $97 million) for the construction of its first ship capable of conducting 3-D seismic mapping of the ocean floor. The vessel, expected to be completed by 2008, would be used to survey the Senkaku Islands, located northeast of Taiwan. A government official stated that while Japan could hire a foreign ship for such surveys, using a non-Japanese vessel in the disputed area would pose challenges. \n\nThe announcement marks a development in ongoing disputes over energy resources and territorial claims in the East China Sea. The official described the approach as proportionate, indicating Japan would respond to actions by other parties. Japan has formally protested China's development of the Chunxiao gas field, which lies near the boundary of the two countries' exclusive economic zones. Japan is concerned about potential gas extraction from its side of the boundary, a demarcation China does not recognize. Negotiations are underway with Japanese companies to begin drilling in the area. \n\nTsutomo Toichi of the Institute of Energy Economics in Tokyo noted that Japan is increasing seismic exploration in the East China Sea. He added that China is constructing a production platform at the Chunxiao field, with potential gas deliveries to Shanghai starting as early as summer. Experts suggest Japan’s exploration near Chunxiao may be more about asserting territorial rights than economic viability, given the distance from Japan’s main islands. However, officials believe the area could also contain oil, which is more easily transportable. \n\nRecent remarks by Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara highlighted rising political attention on territorial issues. Ishihara reported Chinese survey ships operating near Japan’s exclusive economic zone close to Okinotori Island, which Japan administers but China classifies as a 'rock.' He proposed building a power station on the uninhabited island to reinforce Japan’s presence. Separately, Japan and China have disagreed over the planned route of a Russian oil pipeline to be constructed by Transneft."

        "original_text": "Wen Jiabao, China's premier, warned yesterday against \"undue haste\" in the introduction of a more flexible exchange rate, saying any change should be gradual, to avoid derailing policies underpinning economic growth and financial reform. Mr Wen, at a meeting of finance ministers from Asia and Europe in Tianjin, also reasserted China's \"independence\" in determining both the timing and the content of any new currency policy. Beijing's currency, the renminbi, which has been pegged to the US dollar for about a decade, has come under criticism from China's trading partners over claims it gives Chinese exporters an unfair advantage. The US administration is demanding a quick, substantial revaluation, while some members of Congress have proposed a 27.5 per cent tax on Chinese imports if Beijing does not revalue. The controversy over the renminbi has been heightened by China's swelling trade surplus, which is expected to triple to more than Dollars 100bn (Pounds 55bn, Euros 83bn) this year, based on Chinese export and import figures. Before representatives of more than 40 countries, Mr Wen reaffirmed China's longstanding commitment to move to a more flexible system, without disclosing when and how the change would be made. \"By 'gradual progress', we mean to push forward the reform in a step- by-step manner. . . .and guard against undue haste,\" Mr Wen said. \"However, since this reform involves a wide range of areas and will have a far-reaching impact, it still requires a great deal of preparation to help create an enabling environment for all sides to sustain the possible impacts.\" Mr Wen listed a lengthy set of considerations guiding policy on the renminbi, including its impact on domestic economic growth, job creation, financial stability, foreign trade and the ability of local companies to manage currency risk. At the end of this list, Mr Wen said China would also \"keep an eye on the economic and financial performance of neighbouring countries and regions, and of the world as a whole\". China has said previously that it will not change policy to cut bilateral trade surpluses, a reference to the US. China's trade surplus with the US was Dollars 162bn (Euros 134bn, Pounds 89bn) in 2004, on US figures, the highest ever bilateral imbalance. Mr Wen said Beijing's policy to keep the renminbi \"basically stable\" had helped not just China but also the economies and trade in the region and globally. See Comment & Analysis",
        "debiased_text": "Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao stated yesterday that any changes to the exchange rate system should be implemented gradually to maintain economic growth and financial reform policies. Speaking at a meeting of Asian and European finance ministers in Tianjin, Wen emphasized China's independent decision-making regarding the timing and nature of currency policy adjustments. The renminbi, which has been pegged to the US dollar for approximately ten years, has faced international criticism from trade partners who argue it provides Chinese exporters with an advantage. The US government has called for a significant revaluation, with some Congressional members proposing a 27.5% tariff on Chinese imports if no revaluation occurs. China's growing trade surplus, projected to reach over $100 billion this year, has intensified discussions on the renminbi's valuation. Wen reiterated China's commitment to transitioning to a more flexible exchange rate system but did not specify a timeline or method for implementation. He outlined several factors influencing renminbi policy, including domestic economic growth, employment, financial stability, foreign trade, and local firms' ability to manage currency risk. Wen also noted China would consider regional and global economic conditions. China has previously stated it will not adjust policies solely to address bilateral trade imbalances, such as the record $162 billion surplus with the US in 2004. Wen added that maintaining a stable renminbi has benefited China's economy as well as regional and global trade and economic stability."

        "original_text": "Miche`le Alliot-Marie, the French defence minister, has argued that sales of weapons technologies to China could slow Beijing's push to develop its own capabilities, which was part of the reason why her country backed lifting a European Union arms embargo on China. Ms Alliot-Marie insisted France had strict export regimes that would prevent most lethal technologies getting into China's hands. But she told the Financial Times that Beijing was likely to have advanced arms in five years with or without western help. \"The lifting of the embargo could be a better protection for us than maintaining it,\" she said. \"China is rapidly developing its industry, and today our experts say that in five years China could make exactly the same arms that we have today. And they will do it if they cannot import. So maybe if we can sell them the arms, they will not make them. And in five years' time, they will not have the technology to make them.\" Ms Alliot-Marie's comments come ahead of next week's visit to Europe by George W. Bush, US president, when the arms embargo is expected to be on the White House agenda. Powerful members of the US Congress, including Duncan Hunter, House armed services committee chairman, have warned of a backlash if the embargo is lifted - which could include legislation blocking military co-operation with European allies. Ms Alliot-Marie's rationale for lifting the embargo differs significantly from that being made by British diplomats, who have served as the primary interlocutors with the US on the issue. Washington has expressed anger at the EU move to lift the ban, expected to come later this year, arguing that it will enable China to upgrade weapons it could use against American forces in the Taiwan Strait. The UK has argued that the existing embargo is ineffective since it has no legal bearing. It has assured US officials that a move to repeal it would be accompanied by a new export regime that would make arms sales more difficult and more transparent. Ms Alliot-Marie, who is a close political ally of Jacques Chirac, French president, argued that lifting the embargo was largely symbolic. She also characterised the move as part of an attempt to reintegrate China into the international community - a push the US has resisted because of human rights issues. \"The embargo was made about 15 years ago, and the evolution of China and of its international relations have been very significant since then,\" she said. \"We cannot have relationships with China in all these fields - economic, medical, research and so on - and conserve the embargo as it is today.\" The US has resisted public confrontation with the EU on the issue. Condoleezza Rice, US secretary of state, said during her European tour last week that there had been \"fruitful discussions\" on the topic. But privately, senior Pentagon and State Department officials have warned of congressional retaliation if the embargo is lifted. According to recent EU statistics, France granted export licences to China valued at Euros 171m (Pounds 117m) in 2003, the highest of any EU member and a significant increase on 2002, when it granted only Euros 105m. A grand vision, Page 9 www.ft.com/chinainvest",
        "debiased_text": "French Defense Minister Michèle Alliot-Marie stated that selling weapons technologies to China might slow Beijing's development of its own capabilities. This perspective contributed to France's support for lifting the European Union's arms embargo on China. Alliot-Marie emphasized that France maintains strict export controls to limit the transfer of lethal technologies to China. She noted that China is likely to produce advanced arms within five years, regardless of Western assistance. 'Lifting the embargo could provide better protection than maintaining it,' she said, adding that China's domestic industry is advancing rapidly. Her comments precede a visit to Europe by U.S. President George W. Bush, during which the embargo is expected to be discussed. Some U.S. lawmakers, including House Armed Services Committee Chairman Duncan Hunter, have warned of potential repercussions if the embargo is lifted, such as legislative measures restricting military cooperation with European allies. Alliot-Marie's position contrasts with that of British diplomats, who have led discussions with the U.S. on the matter. The U.S. has opposed lifting the embargo, citing concerns about China potentially upgrading weapons that could be used in the Taiwan Strait. The UK has described the current embargo as legally non-binding and proposed replacing it with stricter export controls. Alliot-Marie, a political ally of French President Jacques Chirac, characterized the embargo as largely symbolic and part of efforts to integrate China into the international community—a stance the U.S. has resisted due to human rights concerns. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice acknowledged ongoing discussions on the issue during her recent visit to Europe. Meanwhile, Pentagon and State Department officials have privately cautioned about potential congressional responses if the embargo is lifted. According to EU data, France issued €171 million in export licenses to China in 2003, the highest among EU members and an increase from €105 million in 2002."

        "title": "Review: William Empson by John Haffenden",
        "original_text": "William Empson, Volume 1: Among the Mandarins by John Haffenden 718pp, Oxford, £30 Last year, the Australian writer Elliot Perlman published an enormous novel called Seven Types of Ambiguity. There can't be many novels named after books of literary criticism - I doubt Perlman's next will be entitled Biographia Literaria - and it is as good an index as any of the thoroughly canonical status achieved by William Empson's revolutionary book, published in 1930, when he was only 24. Before that book, writes John Haffenden in his majestic biography, \"no critic had ever written with such wooing detail of the effects of language.\" Empson brought an extraordinarily paradoxical mind to bear on English poetry: on the one hand, he assumed that poetry was a form of rational thought, and could be paraphrased, argued with, and briskly laid bare (and Haffenden shows that there were plenty, like John Middleton Murry, who objected to Empson's analytical clarity, preferring that poetry be kept in the cupboard of the unconscious like some outlandish but revered family heirloom whose function is no longer understood); on the other hand, Empson was so sensitive to ambiguity, to multiple meanings and contradictions in a poetic line or even a single word, that he went a long way towards crediting the indeterminacy, even the undecidability, of meaning in verse. He was at once a literalist and a Freudian theorist. The seventh category of ambiguity in his book occurs when the two meanings of a word \"are the two opposite meanings defined by the context, so that the total effect is to show a fundamental division in the writer's mind\". One of Empson's examples is the word \"Buckle!\" in Hopkins's poem, \"The Windhover\", where buckle can mean both fasten - as in buckle on a military belt - or collapse, as a wheel can buckle. Does Hopkins exhort us here to greater faith, or hint at its frailty? Perhaps both at once. This kind of reading is now standard procedure in criticism, performed a thousand times a day in schoolrooms and lecture halls, so that it can be hard to recall how averse English criticism was, in the first decades of the 20th century, to the idea of letting contradiction stay unreconciled. In a footnote, Empson concedes that many will presume that contradiction always forms \"a larger unity if the final effect is to be satisfying. But the onus of reconciliation can be laid very highly on the receiving end\" - ie, readers may want to push reconciliation on to a text, but that may be just our fantasy of wholeness, not the text's. The low level of much critical thought before Empson's revolution could be amply tasted at Cambridge, where Empson studied English literature. There, Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, the genial Cornishman who had somehow slid into a professorial chair, could write breezily of Shakespeare's comedies that they were essentially \"uncouth,\" and imagine that he was doing criticism. No wonder that Wittgenstein, in a famous story, once marched up to FR Leavis in Trinity Street and commanded: \"Leavis, give up literary criticism!\" Empson, then, founded English criticism as a rigorous academic discourse; but his work also prefigures the deconstructive reading that arose in the 1970s and 80s. (Haffenden, whose commentary in this first volume of biography, is always acute and sensitive, is too eager to separate Empson from later developments in criticism; not for nothing did Paul de Man, the slippery and serpentine Yale deconstructionist, write a fascinated essay on Empson's notion of ambiguity. Perhaps Haffenden will take up de Man in his next volume.) This first volume is a little longer than it might have been, and wants nimble editing. There is too much repetition (a phrase on page 12 is repeated word for word on page 510) and fond quoting where paraphrase might have sufficed; it is not clear that we have to read little Empson's epistle home from prep school about the wonders of Molly's Marsh Mallows. But despite its roominess, it is never dull and often compelling, and must be counted, so far, as one of the finest biographies of an English literary figure. Haffenden is an exceptionally scholarly and diligent guide; the book rests on prodigious feats of labour. Each segment of Empson's life - his landowning background in Yorskhire, his years as a scholar at Winchester, his time at Cambridge, his teaching in Japan and China during the 30s - becomes a miniature history of an institution. And though Haffenden, a professor of English at Sheffield, is certainly academic, he is drawn to stories, many of them funny. Empson's ancestors were a rugged and talented crowd. His great-grandfather edited the Edinburgh Review, though literary aptitude seems to have dwindled down the generations until Empson's birth in 1906. His father was a Yorkshire magistrate, squire, and heavy drinker; his mother was once taken to see Macbeth, only to complain, in shocked tones, that it was \"the most appalling melodrama\". Empson's prose style, like Bertrand Russell's, sounds like its origins: it has an impressive briskness and an air of commonsensical confidence; a critic \"ought to trust his own nose, like the hunting dog\", he wrote in 1950. His elder brother sent home letters of enviable cheerfulness from the trenches of Flanders: \"We had our 'baptism' of fire but it was the C of E method, not total immersion!\" he wrote in 1915. Empson's critical prose is not so far, in tone, from this imperturbable reticence. Haffenden's marvellous book is full of shrewd readings, suggestive details, and comic facts. It is very good to learn that Robert Graves and Laura Riding anticipated Empson's interest in ambiguity and contradiction in their book A Survey of Modernist Poetry, and that Empson certainly read it; we learn that Empson, despite his brilliance at maths, was a poor linguist and uninterested in music (he joins Nabokov in the ranks of those with ears for the music of words but not for the music of music); most wonderfully, we learn that Empson chose not to attend TS Eliot's 1926 Clark lectures at Cambridge on the metaphysical poets, despite his great interest in both the lecturer and his subject, because it was understood that, as a student, one just didn't attend lectures. Finally, Haffenden is sensible about Empson's poetry without overpraising it. For those who, like this reviewer, find that verse lacking in resonance and power, he provides a killingly good parody by Dylan Thomas, which begins: \"Not your winged lust but his must now change suit.\" The second volume of this fine work, which will continue Empson's life from 1940 to 1984, now has a formidable elder sibling to emulate. • James Wood's The Irresponsible Self: On Laughter and the Novel is published by Cape",
        "debiased_text": "John Haffenden's biography, 'William Empson, Volume 1: Among the Mandarins,' published by Oxford, spans 718 pages and is priced at £30. The book examines the life and work of William Empson, whose 1930 publication 'Seven Types of Ambiguity' became a seminal text in literary criticism. Empson was 24 at the time of its publication. Haffenden notes that prior to Empson's work, no critic had analyzed the effects of language with such detailed attention. Empson approached English poetry with a focus on rational thought, treating it as something that could be paraphrased and analyzed, while also acknowledging ambiguity and multiple meanings within poetic language. His seventh category of ambiguity, for instance, highlights words with opposite meanings defined by context, revealing potential divisions in the author's mind. An example cited is the word 'Buckle!' in Gerard Manley Hopkins's poem 'The Windhover,' which can imply both fastening and collapsing. Empson's analytical methods, now standard in literary criticism, were groundbreaking in the early 20th century. Haffenden recounts that before Empson, critical thought at Cambridge, where Empson studied, was less rigorous, with figures like Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch offering less analytical commentary on literature. The book also notes Empson's influence on later critical movements, including deconstruction, though Haffenden emphasizes Empson’s distinctiveness rather than his connection to later developments. The biography provides detailed accounts of Empson’s early life, including his upbringing in Yorkshire, education at Winchester and Cambridge, and teaching in Japan and China during the 1930s. While the book includes extensive research and scholarly insights, some sections could benefit from tighter editing due to occasional repetition and lengthy quotations. Despite this, the biography is thorough and well-researched, offering insights into Empson’s family background, his critical style, and his personal interests, such as his lack of proficiency in languages and music. The book also discusses Empson’s poetry, acknowledging mixed reactions to it, and includes a parody by Dylan Thomas. A second volume is expected to cover Empson’s life from 1940 to 1984."

        "original_text": "Chinese police have sent a message warning against anti-Japanese demonstrations to more than 30m mobile phone users as part of a campaign to prevent protests planned for next week's May holiday. The warning, sent as a text message to mobile phones in the eastern province of Jiangsu this week, underlines the government's determination to counter the use of wireless technology by activists to mobilise and win greater reach for its own propaganda. It also reflects an official desire to end a series of angry anti- Japanese demonstrations in large cities that have piled new strains on already-tense ties between Beijing and Tokyo. The police message says no Japan-related protests have been approved during the May 1 holiday, which begins at the weekend, and that such demonstrations would be \"illegal activities\". \"Please do not believe rumours and false news,\" says the message, sent to subscribers of the two big state-controlled wireless operators, China Mobile and China Unicom, and to some users of a cut- price mobile service offered by fixed-line operator China Telecom. The official Xinhua news agency said Jiangsu's \"Office for Maintaining Stability\" had signed agreements with Mobile and Unicom under which they would distribute \"public interest information\" on behalf of the police when needed. By Wednesday, messages had been sent to 30m subscribers, Xinhua said. The government's resort to mobile text messaging follows its widespread use by organisers of recent anti-Japanese protests that included the stoning of Japan's embassy and ambassador's residence in Beijing and consulate in Shanghai. In Shanghai, journalists at one state media website have been ordered to send at least 10 mobile text messages or internet \"instant messages\" to friends and acquaintances warning against unapproved protest. Recently, websites have been policed and discussions about demonstrations removed or blocked. Some messaging systems have been barred from transmitting sensitive words. While Chinese authorities are sympathetic to protestors' anger at Japan and initially tolerated and sought to manage the protests, they have recently been taking a harder approach. Police in Shanghai have detained 42 people accused of involvement in a demonstration. Demonstrations around May 5 are politically sensitive as it is the anniversary of a 1919 anti-Japanese student protest that sparked a popular reform movement.",

        "original_text": "Faced with a rising tide of Chinese exports, the US and Europe have spent a lot of time worrying about China's economy. They have given less attention to its domestic politics, reasoning that with the Communist party in power there is no foreseeable chance of a change to the status quo. It was typical of Donald Rumsfeld, the US defence secretary, publicly to challenge this assumption and to follow his comments with a disarmingly friendly handshake for a Chinese official. Mr Rumsfeld went to Singapore for the Asian security conference of the International Institute for Strategic Studies set on saying harsh things about China's military modernisation. He accused China of under-reporting its military budget and criticised its growing arsenal of ballistic missiles. But then he strayed beyond the normal boundaries of defence policy. He applauded the global spread of democracy, expressed satisfaction that dictatorships were losing power and suggested China needed \"a growth in political freedom\" and \"a more open and representative government\". The Chinese response was revealing. Cui Tiankai, the senior foreign ministry official present, challenged Mr Rumsfeld on military strategy, asking whether he really believed China faced no threats from abroad and whether the US felt threatened by China. On the taboo subject of Chinese political reform, Mr Cui said nothing. Chinese reform, however, will stay on the world's agenda, if only because it is the most important unresolved political issue of the 21st century. The exchange between Mr Rumsfeld and Mr Cui took place on June 4, when thousands demonstrate peacefully in Hong Kong each year in memory of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy campaigners mown down by troops in 1989. On the same Saturday, a Chinese diplomat addressed a rally in Australia after defecting from his government. In their efforts to stifle debate at home, the Chinese authorities have recently cancelled academic conferences on politics and detained prominent journalists, including a Hong Kong-based correspondent for Singapore's Straits Times, on flimsy accusations of spying. Given US support for totalitarian allies such as Uzbekistan, Mr Rumsfeld's call for freedom in Asia may be dismissed as hypocrisy. Yet on Chinese politics, he is simply stating the obvious: the rapid growth of the Chinese economy must be, and will be, accompanied by political reform. The democratising pressures that have followed every industrial revolution from the UK to South Korea are now visible in China as its people become more prosperous and educated. The key question is one of timing. \"The Chinese are acutely aware that they have to have political reform,\" says Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore and a former UN ambassador. \"They also believe it will take time to change . . . They have seen what happened with (former Soviet president Mikhail) Gorbachev, and they have seen what happened with Yugoslavia, and they don't want that.\" This is the argument that gripped Asia in the 1990s, when Mr Mahbubani and other \"soft authoritarians\" were at the heart of the debate on \"Asian values\" and democracy. The focus now is on communist China and democratic India. Democrats say India has already solved the problem of how to achieve legitimate and peaceful changes of government, whereas for China that vast challenge lies in the future. Authoritarians retort that the Chinese are twice as rich on a per capita basis as the Indians and argue that a rapid imposition of western-style democracy is a recipe for chaos, poverty and bad roads. Mr Mahbubani told Mr Rumsfeld that Asians suspected the US of wanting to destabilise China, and said afterwards that the Chinese were terrified of a naive American belief that \"everything would be wonderful\" if the tide of democracy reached China, when in fact a revolution would be disastrous. Pointing to post-Soviet economic collapse and the revival of authoritarian rule in Russia under President Vladimir Putin, Asian authoritarians make a plausible case that Soviet political reform was much too fast. As defence secretary it may not be his job, but Mr Rumsfeld has argued convincingly that Chinese reform is much too slow. victor.mallet@ft.com",
        "debiased_text": "The US and Europe have focused on China's economic growth amid increasing Chinese exports, while paying less attention to its domestic political dynamics, given the Communist Party's sustained governance. At the Asian security conference organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore, former US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld addressed China's military modernization, criticizing its alleged under-reporting of military spending and expanding ballistic missile capabilities. During the event, Rumsfeld also discussed global democratic trends, suggesting that China would benefit from greater political freedom and a more representative government. In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry official Cui Tiankai questioned Rumsfeld on military perceptions but did not comment on political reform. The exchange occurred on June 4, a date marked by annual demonstrations in Hong Kong commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Separately, a former Chinese diplomat spoke at a rally in Australia after leaving his post. Recent actions by Chinese authorities include the cancellation of academic political conferences and the detention of journalists, some accused of espionage. While the US has been criticized for supporting authoritarian regimes, Rumsfeld's remarks highlighted the broader expectation that China's economic expansion may eventually spur political changes. Analysts like Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, note that Chinese leaders recognize the need for gradual political reform, citing cautionary examples from the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. The debate continues between contrasting governance models, with some emphasizing India's democratic transitions and others pointing to China's economic progress under its current system. Mahbubani also raised concerns that abrupt democratic changes could destabilize China, referencing post-Soviet economic hardships and Russia's political trajectory under Vladimir Putin. While Rumsfeld is not tasked with advocating political reform, his remarks reiterated the view that China's political evolution remains a significant topic in global discourse."

        "title": "Friction May Be EU-U.S. Norm; Flap Over China Arms Embargo Typifies Post-Cold War Divergence; Friction May Be EU-U.S. Norm; Flap Over China Arms Embargo Typifies Post-Cold War Divergence",
        "original_text": "WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH heads home from this week's goodwill tour of Europe, a team of European Union officials will follow close on his heels. Their job: to persuade the U.S. that Europe isn't about to start arming China with high-tech weapons that one day could be turned on American soldiers. It will be a tough sell. EU leaders have said it is all but certain that by June they will lift a 15-year-old arms embargo on China. They say it is a purely symbolic act, and that changes being made in the EU's general code of conduct on arms exports will restrict weapons sales to Beijing at least as much as the embargo does. U.S. officials are unconvinced, though, and the disagreement risks damaging the very relations Mr. Bush's trip was meant to repair. The dispute goes to the heart of the question of how closely America and the EU can work as strategic allies in a post-Cold War world, when their interests aren't always the same and there is no unifying threat on the scale of nuclear annihilation by the former Soviet Union. Easing the strains caused by the U.S.-led war in Iraq is the central goal of Mr. Bush's fence-mending tour of European capitals. But success is likely to depend as much on the hard shovel work done to resolve gritty issues such as the China arms embargo as on the change in atmospherics that Mr. Bush's high-level diplomacy can bring. In his upbeat speech in Brussels yesterday, in which he called for more cooperation between the U.S. and a strong EU, Mr. Bush didn't mention EU arms sales to China. Instead, he focused on more-positive topics such as the revived Middle East peace process. The real test of Mr. Bush's efforts in Europe \"will come in the months after the president returns to the White House,\" said Robin Niblett, director of the European Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. The EU's plan to lift the China embargo and any breakdown in EU negotiations with Iran, he said, \"could again set trans-Atlantic relations on edge.\" Already, the U.S. House of Representatives this month passed a resolution by 411-3 condemning the EU plan, even though the White House's public statements recently have avoided confrontation. Opponents in Congress say the embargo was imposed due to the Chinese regime's massacre of unarmed demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989 and that China's human-rights record hasn't improved enough since to warrant lifting it. At least as important, though, are U.S. fears that sophisticated U.S. weapons systems sold to allies in Europe could end up in Chinese hands. And worse, that U.S. and European military know-how could one day be used against American and Taiwanese troops in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan, which China considers a breakaway territory. On the face of it, there is plenty to worry about. China has been on a massive arms-buying spree in recent years, mainly from Russia. Analysts say China needs sophisticated electronics and engines to make its new Russian jets and other hardware competitive with the U.S. equipment Taiwan has. But the high-tech equipment China needs can come only from the U.S., Europe or Israel. Despite the 1989 embargo, EU nations do sell listed military goods to China because the wording of the embargo is vague, and it is up to each country to define its meaning. Some of the EU's larger arms producers -- France, Britain and Italy -- have interpreted the ban loosely. And not everything that ends up being used by China's military has to be licensed for sale. MTU Freidichshafen GmbH, a German engineering company, has sold diesel engines that now run China's Song class submarines. Daniel Reinhardt, a spokesman for the company, confirmed that MTU's engines are being used in Chinese subs, but said no license was needed because the engine was a civilian item. MTU's Web site says the company sells a modified version of its base engine for use in submarines. MTU declined to comment on whether it had modified any engines, or to say how many engines it had sold to China or when. The European case hasn't been helped by French Defense Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie's comments last week suggesting France might indeed like to sell more weapons to China. In an interview with the Financial Times, Ms. Alliot-Marie said such sales actually might discourage China from advancing the development of its own military technology. \"What the Europeans aren't telling you is that they're gutting their defense budgets,\" said an aide to a senior House Republican involved in the issue. \"What's effectively happening is that to hold on to jobs, they're willing to sell weapons to a regime with very serious human-rights violations. . . . It's transparent to us what the Europeans are doing.\"",
        "debiased_text": "President Bush concluded a visit to Europe this week, after which a delegation of European Union officials is scheduled to travel to the U.S. Their objective is to address U.S. concerns regarding the potential lifting of the EU's 15-year arms embargo on China. EU leaders have indicated that the embargo is likely to be lifted by June, describing the move as symbolic. They argue that revisions to the EU's arms export code will maintain restrictions on weapons sales to China comparable to those under the current embargo. U.S. officials remain skeptical, and the disagreement may affect relations that President Bush's trip aimed to improve. This issue raises broader questions about U.S.-EU strategic cooperation in a post-Cold War context, where shared interests are not always aligned and no overarching threat like the Soviet Union exists. President Bush's visit sought to ease tensions stemming from the U.S.-led Iraq war, but its success may hinge on resolving practical matters like the China embargo, alongside diplomatic engagement. During a speech in Brussels, President Bush emphasized U.S.-EU cooperation and Middle East peace efforts but did not mention the arms embargo. Robin Niblett of the Center for Strategic and International Studies noted that the long-term impact of the trip will depend on post-visit developments, including the EU's decision on the China embargo and negotiations with Iran. The U.S. House of Representatives recently passed a resolution opposing the EU's plan by a 411-3 vote, though the White House has avoided direct confrontation. Critics in Congress argue the embargo was implemented due to China's human rights record, citing the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, and that insufficient progress has been made to justify lifting it. U.S. officials also express concerns that European-sourced military technology could be transferred to China or used against U.S. and Taiwanese forces in a potential conflict over Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory. China has increased arms purchases in recent years, primarily from Russia, but relies on imports from the U.S., Europe, or Israel for advanced technology. While the EU embargo remains in place, some member states, including France, Britain, and Italy, have interpreted restrictions loosely, allowing limited sales of military-related goods to China. For example, German company MTU Friedrichshafen GmbH has supplied diesel engines used in Chinese submarines, though the firm stated these were civilian items not requiring export licenses. French Defense Minister Michèle Alliot-Marie recently suggested arms sales to China could slow its indigenous military development, sparking further debate. A U.S. congressional aide criticized European defense budget cuts, linking potential arms sales to economic pressures and jobs retention, while expressing concerns over human rights considerations."

        "original_text": "Japan yesterday raised the temperature ahead of talks with China over a disputed gas field, describing Beijing's handling of the issue as outrageous. Shoichi Nakagawa, Japan's trade and industry minister, accused China of hypocrisy for exploiting the disputed gas field in the East China Sea even as it agreed to dialogue. \"While shaking hands with the right hand, they are dealing a blow with the left,\" said Mr Nakagawa, who has used the gas issue to assert what he says are Japan's trampled territorial rights. \"Work is proceeding (on the gas field). That is a big problem from the viewpoint of Japan-China friendship.\" The dispute over gas and territorial rights has become a focal point of bitter arguments between China and Japan. Anti-Japanese demonstrations swept through China last month, plunging relations between Asia's two most important economies to what most regard as a 30-year low. Although protests have subsided after signs that Beijing was trying to cool the tension, problems flared again this week when Wu Yi, a Chinese vice-premier, snubbed Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's prime minister, by cancelling a meeting at the last minute. The gas dispute, which will be discussed in a two-day meeting in Beijing beginning on Monday, centres on the Chunxiao field, which has estimated reserves of more than 1,600bn cubic feet of gas. The field lies well within China's self-declared economic exclusion zone (EEZ), but straddles the two countries' territories as defined by Tokyo. China's drilling installation is only 4km from the median line that Japan claims is the internationally accepted standard for determining sea rights, prompting complaints that China is in danger of sucking gas from Japan's side of the reserve. \"We want them to stop this project until we have sorted this out,\" said one senior Japanese official. He accused China of lying to its own people by staking a claim to an extended EEZ based on its continental shelf, a definition he said that had not won out in international arbitration in three decades. China has denounced moves by Tokyo to grant private companies the right to explore for gas in the disputed areas, saying that border differences should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations. \"We consider this kind of action by the Japanese side is a provocation against the rights and interests of China and against the principles of international relations,\" said Kong Quan, foreign ministry spokesman. \"We have already expressed opposition to Japan and reserve the right to respond further.\" China has proposed joint development of resources in areas of the East China Sea, but Japan has described those offers as \"vague and insincere\". Mr Nakagawa also denounced the venue of the talks, saying they should be in Tokyo. The two sides last met in Beijing in October, but the talks \"ended in total failure\", according to one Japanese official.",

Japanese officials have raised concerns that China's activities may extract gas from reserves claimed by Japan. \n\nShoichi Nakagawa, Japan's Minister of Trade and Industry, stated that Japan has requested a suspension of China's gas project until the dispute is resolved. Japan disputes China's claim to an extended EEZ based on its continental shelf, citing a lack of international arbitration support for such a definition.

        "original_text": "A U.S. government committee cleared the sale of International Business Machines Corp.'s personal-computer unit to Lenovo Group Ltd. of China after the companies made accommodations to ease national- security concerns raised during an unusual extended review. The most significant modification is that after Lenovo buys the PC division, its operations will be moved into a separate facility in IBM's office park in Raleigh, N.C., a person familiar with the matter said. Employees of the PC division currently work in several buildings in the office park where employees of other IBM divisions work. The proposed $1.25 billion IBM-Lenovo deal heightened concerns in Washington over China's increasing economic power and technological sophistication. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as Cfius, the government task force that reviews foreign bids for U.S. companies, conducted an extended examination of the deal after top Republicans in Congress raised alarms about Lenovo's close ties to the authoritarian government. Though IBM, Armonk, N.Y., will take a minority stake in Lenovo, the state-controlled Chinese Academy of Sciences still will own about 30% of Lenovo after the deal. Most transactions move through Cfius readily, but the IBM-Lenovo deal was waylaid by committee members' concerns that Lenovo's Chinese employees might have access to \"sensitive\" work being done at the Raleigh facility. IBM's offices there include sales, marketing and some server development, among other things, in addition to PC development. IBM has large numbers of U.S. government customers. The committee was comforted by a plan to house Lenovo's Raleigh operations, post-acquisition, in a separate, three-building complex. Lenovo's corporate headquarters, with a staff of about 100, will move to New York from Beijing. Approval of the deal -- the first billion-dollar purchase in the U.S. by a mainland Chinese company -- reinforces the administration's commitment to economic engagement with China, despite the rising domestic anxieties stirred by the mainland. But the sharp debate underscored the sometimes crosscutting pressures buffeting the U.S.- Sino relationship. The White House is leaning on Beijing to help curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions. At the same time, the administration has sanctioned Chinese companies for trading with Iran, a country it accuses of illicitly pursuing a nuclear weapon, and has flagged concerns about a potential surge in China-made imports of textile products. \"This has been a wake-up call to a lot of people,\" said Michael Wessel, who sits on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a bipartisan panel that advises Congress. \"This should not be seen as a signal that every transaction is going to be easily approved. There's going to be rising scrutiny.\" Cfius includes representatives from several cabinet-level departments, including Treasury, Justice, Defense and Homeland Security. The companies announced the clearance yesterday morning, several days ahead of the deadline for a committee recommendation. \"The completion of this process is an important step forward for Lenovo,\" its chief executive, Yang Yuanqing, said in a news release. A spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the release. Steve Ward, the head of IBM's PC division and the CEO-designate of Lenovo, said the deal will close in the second quarter, as expected. The deal, which will make Lenovo the world's third largest PC maker by units shipped behind Dell Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co., was announced in December 2004. The clearance gives IBM a long-anticipated exit from its PC business, which has been hampered by price cuts driven by low-cost leader Dell. The personal-computer unit, which makes IBM PCs and ThinkPad laptops, has posted a string of losses in recent years. --- Evan Ramstad contributed to this article.",

        "original_text": "Clarence House officials yesterday threatened to take legal action against a Sunday newspaper for printing an eight-year-old memo by Prince Charles in which he apparently described China's Communist leaders as \"appalling old waxworks\" and criticised the coterie of advisers surrounding Tony Blair as inexperienced. The prince's spokeswoman accused the Mail on Sunday of making use of unlawfully copied documents. There was no suggestion that they were inauthentic. The prince's memorandum was apparently hand-written following his presence in June 1997 at the handover of Hong Kong to the Chinese authorities at which he represented the Queen. Entitled \"The Handover of Hong Kong or the Great Chinese Takeaway\", it derides the \"ridiculous rigmarole\" and \"awful Soviet-style display\" of goose-stepping Chinese soldiers during the ceremony and mocks the Chinese leaders who took part. He wrote: \"After my speech the president detached himself from the group of appalling old waxworks who accompanied him and took his place at the lectern.\" But the prince also took the opportunity to rail against the then newly elected Blair government's decision to axe the royal yacht Britannia. \"If only [the prime minister] could have seen the yacht with the receptions and dinners under way and heard people's reactions ... but they are all in such a hurry, so never really learn about anything.\" The newspaper's pretext for publishing the remarks now was last week's state visit by the Chinese president, Hu Jintao. Prince Charles, who boycotted the last official state visit in 1999 because of the Chinese authorities' behaviour in Tibet, was also absent from last week's state banquet because he and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, were flying back from the US. A Clarence House spokeswoman said: \"It is quite clear to us that the source for this story is material that was unlawfully accessed and copied and then handed to the Mail on Sunday [which] had full knowledge of these facts, yet still chose to use the material as the basis for their story.\" A spokesman for the paper said: \"Copies of the prince's journal were circulated to a wide range of people. As far as [we] are concerned this has been a classic journalistic exercise and we came into possession of the text entirely legitimately.\"",

        "original_text": "SHANGHAI -- Hu Cunxi thought he understood the financial risks of \"big sickness\" -- or \"da bing\" -- the common Chinese term for cancer, stroke and other life-threatening diseases. He had edited a popular Chinese manual on household finances that encourages readers to load up on medical insurance. He himself had bought a policy from a unit of New York-based insurer American International Group Inc. He saw it as prudent backup to the government-mandated coverage he received as an editor at the state- owned Shanghai Financial News. Five years ago, Mr. Hu's wife, Cao Meihua, a high-school teacher, was diagnosed with \"big sickness.\" Then Mr. Hu himself fell ill. Now both husband and wife, who are in their late 40s, are battling advanced cancer, and occupy adjacent wards of a Shanghai hospital. China's high-cost hospital system swiftly overwhelmed the insurance coverage they had through their state jobs. Mr. Hu's AIG policy wasn't designed to cover such medical calamities. Their treatments have consumed their life savings and his parents' retirement nest egg. They are now broke. \"We used to be white-collar workers,\" says Mr. Hu, who seethes with anger about the quality of his government insurance. \"Now, we're in poverty.\" More than two-thirds of China's 1.3 billion people have no health insurance at all, and many cannot afford any medical care. But under China's pay-as-you-go health-care system, even those with insurance are often forced to make agonizing decisions about whether they can afford treatment for serious illness. Problems with insurance coverage have become a crisis for China's growing urban middle class, eating into support for the ruling Communist Party. As recently as the late 1970s, the Chinese government controlled all hospitals, employed all doctors, and offered almost universal health- care coverage. In the cities, the state provided insurance to civil servants, factory workers and their families. Collective farms provided care in the countryside. But the entire system began breaking down in the early 1980s as market-style reforms led collective farms to disband and money-losing factories to close. Tens of millions of workers were left without jobs or insurance. A decade ago, Beijing began looking for a new health-insurance model. In 1998, government authorities introduced a national program called Basic Medical Insurance. All employers are required to provide employees with some coverage for both routine medical problems and \"big sickness.\" To fund the plan, workers contribute 2% of their salaries, on average, and employers contribute an additional 7.5%. Family members, however, are not covered, and children must rely on limited insurance programs provided by schools. Authorities enforce the requirements for state companies, but large parts of the booming private sector ignore it. The government plan has many gaps. At the end of 2003, it offered insurance protection to 109 million urban workers. That constitutes less than 20% of China's approximately 600 million urban dwellers. Coverage in rural areas is even spottier. Studies show that three- quarters of private-sector employees remain uninsured. The Basic Medical Insurance itself is limited. Typically, it covers 70% to 80% of hospital charges. Patients must pay the rest, in cash. Seriously ill patients who cannot raise sufficient money are forced to check out of hospitals, or to opt for less expensive courses of treatment. Basic drugs are covered, but expensive new medicines such as powerful anti-cancer drugs are not. \"It's a real problem,\" concedes Mao Qunan, spokesman for the Ministry of Health. \"People should consider commercial insurance.\" Chen Ailian, a 65-year-old volunteer at the Shanghai Cancer Recovery Club, was diagnosed with breast cancer 17 years ago. \"If I had got sick today, I would never have survived,\" she says. She needed surgery, so her state-owned sewing-machine factory sent a note to the hospital promising payment. The operation cost $500, but she didn't have to pay any of it. Today, hospital emergency rooms demand cash up front, whether or not a patient has insurance. Insured patients pay for everything from gurneys to emergency surgery, then apply for reimbursement later. Those without cash are denied treatment. In 2003, He Guofu turned up at a Shanghai emergency room six hours after suffering a stroke. The surgeon told Mr. He's wife, Sun Yuanzhen, that her husband needed surgery to relieve pressure on his brain. He told her it would cost $7,000 to operate, paid in advance, but warned her there was only a 50-50 chance the procedure would help. Mr. He, who worked at a state-owned construction company, and his wife, a retired statistician, were not poor. They both had insurance. But they didn't have that kind of cash on hand, and Mr. He's employer refused to advance it, even though insurance was likely to reimburse at least some of it. Ms. Sun hesitated. It was a Friday night. She decided to think about it over the weekend. The 50-50 odds worried her. By Monday, she had decided to borrow the money, but the surgeon told her it was too late to operate. Her indecision still tortures her. Her husband, who is 54, is now bedridden and requires spoon-feeding, and Ms. Sun struggles to pay her teenage son's school fees. She regrets that she didn't scramble to raise the money and gamble on the surgery. \"Everything was a blur,\" she says. \"I was so confused.\" Health-care costs in China are rising rapidly, turning hospitals into symbols of unfettered capitalism. Chinese and international health experts blame runaway costs in part on an effort to make treatment more affordable for the poor. Authorities capped prices for basic drugs and procedures at below-market rates. But they let hospitals compensate by profiting on almost everything else, from advanced drugs to sophisticated diagnostic tests. That decision created an incentive to provide high-end treatment that has transformed Chinese hospitals, making world-class care available to those who can afford it. Even small-city hospitals, once technological backwaters, boast CT scanners. In each of the past five years, Shanghai hospitals have spent nearly $100 million on sophisticated medical equipment, says Hu Shanlian, a professor of health management at the city's Fudan University and an adviser to the Chinese government. Drug sales account for 45% of the revenues of Shanghai hospitals, he says. \"The health system is really in a crisis,\" he says. Doctors, many of them employees of state-owned hospitals, also have an incentive to steer patients toward high-cost treatments and drugs. The average monthly pay for Shanghai doctors is less than $400, not much more than a taxi driver working overtime can make. But they can double their incomes through bonuses earned by prescribing tests and by dispensing drugs with high profit margins. Few medical systems in the world link doctors' pay so directly to revenue from patients, health-care economists say. Mr. Mao, the Ministry of Health spokesman, contends that market forces have gone too far. \"If you only trust the market, you will have a disaster,\" he argues. The government needs to play a leading role, he says. The practices of hospitals and doctors are only lightly regulated by Beijing, and there is little self-regulation. China lacks the kind of medical professional associations that set ethical standards, hear complaints and punish wrongdoers in the U.S. and other countries. When Chinese authorities decided on the national insurance plan, they failed to recognize an inherent design flaw: The system reimburses hospitals for at least a portion of whatever care they choose to deliver. In effect, government economists acknowledge, the state has become a blank check for doctors. The system encourages doctors to overprescribe expensive drugs and tests, economists say, then to charge patients for whatever their insurance does not cover. In the U.S., health insurers guard against that outcome through \"utilization review,\" a process under which they evaluate the medical necessity of hospital treatment. Tests and procedures deemed unnecessary are not reimbursed. Although the effectiveness of such reviews varies, the process discourages blatantly unnecessary treatments. In China, there are typically no such review procedures. Most health-insurance plans in the U.S. also set out-of-pocket maximums for patients facing medical catastrophes. In addition to protecting seriously ill patients from financial ruin, the caps provide another incentive for hospitals to control costs: Large bills have to be justified to the insurance companies responsible for paying them. A World Bank study of China by economists Adam Wagstaff and Magnus Lindelow concluded that patients with insurance are sometimes persuaded to undergo far more expensive treatments than the uninsured. Chinese doctors have \"strong incentive to favor high-tech care over basic care,\" which may be more costly and sophisticated than necessary, the report said. Insurance may \"actually increase the probability of large out-of-pocket payments,\" the report concluded. There is no formal complaint procedure for patients, the economists added. The Ministry of Health's Mr. Mao says the government has spent two years negotiating with hospitals over how to make drug prices and profit incentive systems more reasonable. \"It's a very complicated issue,\" he says. \"It takes time. We don't want to get it wrong and then have to start all over again.\" The Chinese government's share of total health spending has plummeted. Between 1978 and 2003, private outlays as a percentage of total health-care spending rose from to 60% from 20%, government figures show. The shift comes as chronic diseases such as cancer, which are costly to treat, replace contagious ones like tuberculosis as the biggest burden on the medical system. Chinese government officials have acknowledged that health care has become such a financial burden to people, even to those with insurance, that it threatens social stability. President Hu Jintao has pledged to increase government health spending. The government is trying to expand state insurance coverage to more people in cities and the countryside. In cities, officials are trying to set up a network of government-funded community health centers as a first stop for patients. They would provide basic care and advise patients about treatment options, drugs and hospitalization. Before \"big sickness\" struck in 2000, Mr. Hu, the editor, and Ms. Cao, his wife, were making nearly $5,000 a year. In China, that put them at the bottom edge of the middle class. They had married late and were childless, which gave them some financial freedom. They bought a two-bedroom apartment with a $25,000 mortgage from China Construction Bank. They both had insurance through their state employers. Like growing numbers of upwardly mobile professionals, they decided to supplement it for extra peace of mind. Believing that his government insurance would cover any \"big sickness,\" Mr. Hu turned to American International Assurance Co., a unit of AIG, for personal accident insurance. Like other Western insurers, AIG is betting demand will grow for private health insurance to cover gaps in government coverage. Mr. Hu's insurance agent at AIG, Wu Caihong, does a brisk business selling \"big sickness\" policies that offer lump-sum cash payments to policyholders who fall ill. She says she tells her customers that extra medical insurance \"isn't a nice-to-have, it's a must-have.\" Ms. Wu says that after selling Mr. Hu the accident policy, she tried repeatedly to persuade him to buy \"big sickness\" coverage. But by then, Mr. Hu's wife had contracted breast cancer, and Mr. Hu had no spare money for premiums on a new policy. Ms. Cao, who had retired from her teaching job, still had government insurance coverage, but it did not cover the expensive form of chemotherapy she needed. Mr. Hu went into overdrive to make ends meet. He set out to earn extra cash at night by editing books he hoped would sell to China's hobbyists. He dashed off 11 books in four years, including a history of Chinese teapots and a collector's guide to subway tickets. But sales were disappointing, and the extra work has earned him to date only $1,500. Last year, doctors informed Mr. Hu that he had stomach cancer. He also learned that his government insurance would not cover the kind of chemotherapy he needed. To save money during his first year of treatment, he relied on a mixture of medicines covered by his insurance. This year, after the cancer spread to his liver, he switched to a more powerful drug regimen recommended by his doctor. The new drugs were much more expensive -- and he had to buy them himself. The more aggressively they battled their cancers, the deeper he and his wife pushed themselves into debt. They borrowed money from friends and relatives. Mr. Hu tried to sell their apartment, but he found that superstitious Shanghai buyers shun houses where \"big sickness\" has struck. He says even old friends, worried that being around him would bring bad luck, stopped dropping by. So far, they have spent about $25,000 for her treatment and $12,000 for his. \"When you get this disease, there's no bottom line,\" says Mr. Hu, a scholarly man who now has dark rims beneath his eyes. A Communist Party member, he is furious that so few drugs are covered by his government insurance. In desperation over their illnesses, Mr. Hu and his wife have turned to religion. He became a devout Christian after a group of elderly women from a local church stopped by his hospital bed to pray. A black Bible sits by his pillow in the hospital ward. These days, he relies on donations from members of his congregation to help foot his hospital bills. Ms. Cao's breast cancer has spread to her lungs, leaving her close to death. \"We're both intellectuals. We're supposed to know about insurance,\" she says. \"But we realize now that insurance just doesn't work. If you want to stay alive, you have to pay yourself.\" --- Ellen Zhu Shanghai and Kersten Zhang in Beijing contributed to this article.",
        "debiased_text": "SHANGHAI — Hu Cunxi, an editor at the state-owned Shanghai Financial News, and his wife, Cao Meihua, a high-school teacher, both in their late 40s, are currently receiving treatment for advanced cancer in a Shanghai hospital. Five years ago, Ms. Cao was diagnosed with cancer, followed by Mr. Hu. Their medical expenses have exceeded the coverage provided by their state employer-sponsored insurance. Mr. Hu also held a personal accident insurance policy from American International Group Inc., but it did not cover their medical needs. Their treatments have depleted their savings and his parents' retirement funds.\n\nIn China, over two-thirds of the population lacks health insurance, and even those with coverage often face significant out-of-pocket costs for serious illnesses. The Chinese government introduced Basic Medical Insurance in 1998, requiring employers to contribute 7.5% of payroll costs and employees to contribute 2% of their salaries for coverage. However, this program does not extend to family members, and rural coverage remains limited. As of 2003, the program covered 109 million urban workers, or less than 20% of China’s urban population.\n\nThe Basic Medical Insurance typically covers 70% to 80% of hospital expenses, leaving patients responsible for the remainder. Advanced treatments and newer medications, including certain cancer drugs, are often excluded. Hospitals in China frequently require upfront payments, even from insured patients, who must later seek reimbursement. Those unable to pay may be denied care.\n\nHistorically, China’s healthcare system was fully state-controlled until market reforms in the 1980s led to reduced coverage. The government has since sought to reform the system, including efforts to expand insurance and establish community health centers. However, healthcare costs continue to rise, driven in part by hospitals compensating for capped prices on basic treatments by promoting higher-cost services and drugs.\n\nDoctors in state-owned hospitals, who receive modest base salaries, often earn additional income through bonuses linked to prescribing tests and medications with high profit margins. This practice is not heavily regulated, and China lacks formal medical associations to enforce ethical standards.\n\nA World Bank study noted that insured patients in China may sometimes undergo more expensive treatments than uninsured patients due to financial incentives for providers. The Ministry of Health acknowledges challenges in the system and has been in discussions with hospitals to adjust pricing and incentives.\n\nThe share of private spending in total healthcare costs has risen from 20% in 1978 to 60% in 2003, reflecting reduced government contributions. Chronic diseases like cancer now represent a growing burden on the system. The government has pledged to increase healthcare funding and expand coverage.\n\nMr. Hu and Ms. Cao, previously earning nearly $5,000 annually, utilized their insurance and savings for treatment. When their coverage proved insufficient, they borrowed from relatives and attempted to sell their apartment, though without success. Mr. Hu’s additional income from writing books provided limited relief. Both have since turned to religious and community support to help cover costs.\n\nMs. Cao’s cancer has spread to her lungs, and their financial situation remains strained. 'Insurance just doesn’t work,' Ms. Cao remarked. 'If you want to stay alive, you have to pay yourself.'"

        "original_text": "China's poor safety record worsened yesterday when the government reported that at least 26 revellers were killed on Christmas night by a fire that ripped through an unlicensed bar in the southern city of Zhongshan, which borders Macau. Across China, around 800,000 people have been killed this year in accidents, which are now the main cause of death for those aged between one and 34. According to the state-run Xinhua news agency, more than 100 people were packed inside the western-style bar and restaurant when the fire broke out. Many revellers were reportedly celebrating Christmas, which is not a traditional Chinese holiday but is becoming an increasingly popular festival among young people, particularly in the southern boom towns. Many were reportedly unable to escape the fire and smoke because the bar's entrance - located inside the restaurant - was too narrow to allow people to evacuate quickly. The cause is under investigation by the township and Guangdong provincial authorities, but witnesses interviewed on Hong Kong television said that there had been an explosion before the fire spread through the building. A local resident told Reuters news agency that disco lights fell from the ceiling shortly after the manager started to hand out Christmas gifts. The local police and fire brigade refused to answer media inquiries. But pictures on China Central Television showed firefighters groping through the blackened ruins of the bar, where the ceiling had collapsed. At least 11 of the injured were taken for treatment of burns and smoke inhalation at the local Zhongshan People's hospital. According to local media, the bar was unregistered and lacked basic fire-safety equipment. \"This small bar is an illegal business inside a restaurant,\" an official of the local Communist party propaganda office told reporters. \"The bar owner has been detained for investigation.\" Such deadly accidents are all too common in China, where safety concerns take second place to economic growth. Earlier this month, a hospital fire in Liaoyuan, in north-eastern Jilin province, killed 39 people and forced patients to jump from fourth-floor windows. In Shantou, Guangdong province, a hotel blaze this summer killed 31, many of whom were karaoke hostesses. In a separate report in the Chinese media yesterday, Qi Xiaoqiu, head of the ministry of health's disease control department, said that 800,000 people died in accidents nationwide every year. He said it was now the main cause of death among young people and an increasing cause for concern. \"Accidents have not only caused a great number of deaths, but also led to a great many people with injuries, posing a serious threat to the public health sector in China,\" said the official.",

        "original_text": "China's government is stepping up efforts to reform its huge postal savings system in a process expected to lead to the creation of the country's fifth biggest bank. Previous attempts to separate the savings network, with its tens of thousands of branches and 250m depositors, from the rest of the postal system have been blocked by bureaucratic opposition. However, an official of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau said yesterday that China's State Council, or cabinet, and bodies such as the central bank and powerful National Development and Reform Commission were now focused on the issue. \"They are really 'beating the gongs and drums' on this,\" the official said, citing a Chinese saying. \"Reform of the postal savings is already under way. In the future it will become a 'postal savings bank'.\" The China Banking Regulatory Commission yesterday quoted its chairman, Liu Mingkang, as saying effective reform of the postal savings system must be \"firmly grasped\" in 2005, but gave no details. There has been heated discussion in recent years on how to reform the postal savings system, which currently holds slightly over Rmb1,000bn (Dollars 121bn, Euros 93bn, Pounds 64bn) in deposits, accounting for more than 9 per cent of total deposits. If the system is successfully turned into a bank, it will be China's fifth largest after the Industrial and Commercial Bank, Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank. State Post Bureau officials have opposed transforming the savings network into a bank, say analysts, in part because it accounts for a large proportion of the revenues of the postal system and an even larger proportion of profits. The role of the postal savings system has been controversial for some time. It started taking deposits in late 1980s, partly as a way of easing inflation by reducing liquidity, since all its funds were redeposited with the central bank at a special high rate of interest. Since the late 1990s, however, deflation has been more of a problem for China than inflation and the postal savings system has been blamed for sucking capital out of poorer rural regions that already have too little. The official Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau said no specific plans had yet been issued for how the new bank would be structured or what businesses it would be permitted to take part in. Postal savings managers have no experience of commercial lending and some analysts say its business should be restricted to taking deposits, offering remittance services, and areas such as interbank lending. \"They should certainly not be making loans,\" said Yi Xianrong, a financial sector expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. For regional news, see www.ft.com/asia",

If converted into a bank, it would rank as the fifth-largest financial institution in the country, following the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China. Analysts indicate that State Post Bureau officials have resisted transforming the savings network into a bank, partly due to its significant contribution to postal system revenues and profits. The postal savings system began accepting deposits in the late 1980s, initially to help manage inflation by reducing liquidity, as funds were redeposited with the central bank at a preferential interest rate. In the late 1990s, deflation became a greater concern than inflation, and critics argued the system diverted capital from rural areas with limited financial resources. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau confirmed that no specific plans have been released regarding the structure or permitted activities of the proposed bank. Some analysts suggest the bank should focus on deposits, remittance services, and interbank lending, given the lack of commercial lending experience among postal savings managers.

        "original_text": "In the gathering storm in Washington over \"unfair\" trading by China, there is no more sensitive lightning rod than textiles and clothing - and no US industry is more persistent in demanding government action to stem a flood of Chinese exports. Listen to the industry and you would think the end of the world had arrived. Since the elaborate global quotas that long restricted trade in textiles were abolished in January, US producers have squealed that overwhelming Chinese competition is devastating their already struggling businesses. Yet where exactly is the evidence for those claims? Indisputably, imports from China have shot up. According to US data, imports of Chinese clothing were 70 per cent - and of textiles 39 per cent - higher at the end of February than a year earlier. But most of China's gains have been at the expense of other exporters and often reflect its producers' decisions to repatriate offshore production in anticipation of the removal of quotas. That the US industry has been harmed is far less obvious. The steady decline in its employment and output has not quickened: the rate of job losses in the first quarter was actually lower than the average since the mid- 1990s, while product prices firmed slightly. If US producers' lobbying defies the facts, the European Union's industry has barely bothered with them. It has demanded protection without even waiting for the release of consolidated EU trade data. Of course, the Chinese challenge may yet squeeze western companies. But it is fanciful to suppose three more years of trade barriers against China - the most allowed by World Trade Organisation rules - would restore their competitiveness, particularly after decades of protection have failed to do so. More likely, the beneficiaries would be other low-cost exporters, such as India. Such arguments, alas, may not be enough to prevent barriers going up again. Blaming foreigners for problems of your own making is always an easy political option. And it may not stop at textiles. As the US current account deficit with China widens, backing in Congress for trade liberalisation is ebbing, while proposals for WTO- illegal trade sanctions unless Beijing revalues the renminbi are gaining support. Even big US companies with investments in China are struggling to be heard on Capitol Hill. Beijing seems to be listening, though. At EU urging, it is already trying to place voluntary restraints on textiles exports and is considering extending the measures to other products. If China could make such controls work - by no means certain - it might defuse some conflicts. But Brussels should be careful what it asks for. The EU, like the US, continues to deny China's exports \"market economy\" status, on the grounds that the state plays too big a role in its economy. For Brussels now to incite Beijing to intervene in the market by managing trade is not just inconsistent. It is shooting itself in the foot. The long-term winners from such a policy would be Chinese companies, not western ones. Indeed, China would win twice. First, it would get to keep all the \"rents\" generated by voluntary restrictions. Second, limiting export volumes would induce its manufacturers to maximise profits by moving into the kinds of more sophisticated products in which western companies currently have a competitive advantage. That is exactly what happened in Japan, after the US strong- armed it into restraining voluntarily exports of cars and other products in the 1980s. Not only did the measures fail to save Detroit; they increased Toyota's incentive to attack the luxury end of the market by launching the Lexus. The rest, as they say, is history. If the US and the EU really want China to moderate its surging exports, they should urge it to tackle their root cause: its inefficient system of allocating capital, which encourages massive investments in surplus capacity and results in ferocious price competition between producers at home and, increasingly, abroad. This will be a long task, requiring deep reforms of China's banking and capital markets. It will not yield the rapid results western politicians want. But reaching for quick fixes through trade restrictions, based on bogus arguments by domestic industries with a long record of dismal failure, would only make matters much worse. guy.dej@ft.com",
        "debiased_text": "In the ongoing discussions in Washington regarding trade with China, textiles and clothing have emerged as a prominent topic. The US textile industry has frequently requested government intervention to address increased imports from China. Since the removal of global textile quotas in January, US producers have reported significant competitive pressure from Chinese exports. According to US trade data, imports of Chinese clothing rose by 70% and textiles by 39% by the end of February compared to the previous year. However, much of China's growth in exports appears to have replaced shipments from other countries, as Chinese producers brought offshore production back in anticipation of quota elimination. Employment and output declines in the US textile sector have not accelerated, with job losses in the first quarter lower than the historical average since the mid-1990s, while product prices saw a slight increase. The European Union's textile industry has also called for protection measures, even before consolidated EU trade data was available. Some analysts suggest that trade barriers against China, permitted for up to three years under WTO rules, may not improve Western companies' competitiveness, as decades of protection have not done so previously. Other low-cost exporters, such as India, could benefit instead. In the US, concerns over the growing trade deficit with China have led to reduced support for trade liberalization in Congress, with some proposing WTO-disputed sanctions unless China revalues its currency. Meanwhile, Beijing has indicated willingness to impose voluntary export restraints on textiles following EU requests, with potential expansion to other products. Critics note that such measures could inadvertently strengthen Chinese companies by encouraging them to move into higher-value products, as seen historically with Japan’s automotive industry. Experts argue that long-term solutions to China’s export growth would require structural reforms in its financial system to address inefficiencies in capital allocation, a process unlikely to yield immediate results."

        "original_text": "The acquisition of IBM's personal computer business by Lenovo, China's biggest computer supplier, was thrown into doubt yesterday as Republicans in the US Congress said it could threaten American security interests. A trio of Republican committee chairmen led by Duncan Hunter, chairman of the House armed services committee, called for a full security review of the sale, warning that it could result in the transfer of US military-related technologies to Beijing. Lenovo's agreement last month to buy IBM's US-based PC division for Dollars 1.75bn (Pounds 940m) would be the biggest overseas acquisition by a Chinese company. But the Republicans want a full 45-day review by the committee on foreign investment in the US, an inter-agency group that assesses the security and economic risks of takeovers by foreign groups of US companies. In a letter to John Snow, treasury secretary and CFIUS chairman, they said the deal could also result in advanced US technology and corporate assets falling into Chinese government hands. An extended review could force IBM and Lenovo to begin negotiating changes to the deal to alleviate concerns. \"What needs to be done is proper checks by our government and the proper regulatory authorities,\" said a spokesperson for Mr Hunter. If the US government were to block the transaction, it would be a heavy blow to Lenovo's ambitions. It sees the deal as a way to establish a global brand, bringing the financial resources needed to match its rivals. A US move to block the acquisition would also have implications far beyond Lenovo. Beijing and other Chinese groups could see it as a signal that the US could try to stop them moving into strategic businesses. The opposition from Mr Hunter and Henry Hyde, chairman of the House international relations committee, could pose a serious threat to the deal. Mr Hunter - who has influential allies within the Pentagon - has long wanted to strengthen national security reviews of foreign takeovers. IBM appears to have been caught off-guard, and it is unclear why the sale of relatively low-level technology should cause such a stir. Bill Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, representing US multinationals, said such questions were largely settled during the Clinton administration.",

An extended review process might require IBM and Lenovo to revise terms of the agreement. A spokesperson for Representative Hunter stated that government oversight procedures should be followed. If blocked, the deal's failure could affect Lenovo's expansion plans and potentially influence how Chinese companies view US market accessibility for strategic sectors.

Dylan Tinker, an analyst at UBS Investment Research in Hong Kong, noted that the company's significant investment in one of its two mobile-phone networks, at the expense of the other, led to a loss of high-end customers who typically pay higher fees."

        "original_text": "The low profile of the Chinese oil companies behind the $1.42 billion purchase of EnCana Corp.'s oil and pipeline assets in Ecuador underscores a growing sensitivity to concerns about China's appetite for natural resources in the wake of the failed bid for Unocal Corp. EnCana, a Canadian oil and natural-gas producer, on Tuesday announced the deal with Andes Petroleum Corp., which it described as a joint venture of Chinese companies that weren't identified by name. An official at the energy bureau of China's State Development and Reform Commission, which regulates the industry, yesterday declined to comment on the EnCana deal. \"We don't want big publicity for such cases,\" he said. \"Some media reports in the past distorted facts and caused misunderstanding in Western countries. It's all unnecessary trouble.\" An executive at China National Petroleum Corp. said his company, one of the country's largest state-owned energy companies, is one participant. The executive and another person familiar with the matter said another major state-run concern, China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, is also involved. However, CNPC spokesman Liu Weijiang said, \"We're not going to publish any information about this case. We've set a rule that it's not appropriate to talk much about this kind of things.\" Sinopec's spokesman couldn't be reached for comment yesterday. The deal, small by oil standards, highlights the continued challenges facing China as it scrambles to build up its reserves and strengthen its energy assets. Even as Chinese companies strike deals for less-desirable assets eschewed by big Western companies, like the ones in Ecuador, they face growing political pressure from the U.S. and other countries worried about China's global quest for oil. Niu Li, an oil expert at the State Information Center, a government think tank, said the Chinese government is discouraging publicity for fear that it would spark further global concerns over China's energy deals. \"China's oil demand has created misunderstanding in the world,\" Mr. Niu said. China's low-profile approach follows a failed bid by Cnooc Ltd., the publicly traded arm of state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp., to acquire Unocal. Although Cnooc offered a higher bid, Unocal ultimately opted to accept a rival offer by Chevron Corp. amid criticism and questions from the U.S. Congress over Cnooc's intentions. People involved in the failed deal said they were surprised by the political backlash. The Chinese companies' purchase continues a trend of buying up bits and pieces of assets wherever possible, whether in Africa or Latin America, or more recently, Canada. In many cases the Chinese companies are paying top dollar for assets that Western companies shun; Ecuador has been hit by disputes over the country's oil wealth, with its oil industry crippled by strikes this year. The CNPC executive said the company already had an oil field in Ecuador, and the new deal will expand the company's business in the region. However, an official at Sinochem Corp., another Chinese state- run oil company that operates a separate oil field in Ecuador but opted against participating in the EnCana deal, said Chinese companies aren't in that country because of its high-quality oil assets, but because they have little choice. \"Western companies are powerful and competitive. They can choose to go to some good places,\" the official said. -- Ellen Zhu and Kathy Chen",
        "debiased_text": "Chinese oil companies involved in the $1.42 billion acquisition of EnCana Corp.'s oil and pipeline assets in Ecuador have maintained a low profile.

(CNPC) executive confirmed the company's participation, while another source indicated China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec) is also involved. CNPC stated it would not disclose further details. Sinopec could not be reached for comment. The acquisition reflects China's efforts to expand its energy reserves despite facing political scrutiny, particularly from the U.S., over its global energy investments. An analyst noted that the Chinese government prefers limited publicity to avoid amplifying concerns about its energy deals. This follows Cnooc Ltd.'s unsuccessful attempt to acquire Unocal, which drew political opposition in the U.S. Chinese companies continue to acquire energy assets in regions like Africa, Latin America, and Canada, often focusing on areas less prioritized by Western firms. An executive from CNPC stated the deal expands its operations in Ecuador, while an official from Sinochem Corp. noted Chinese companies invest in such regions due to limited alternatives compared to Western firms."

        "original_text": "Jasmine tea can be a life-saver. It certainly helped me through a week in Singapore a few years ago, when shuttling between hot, humid streets and air-conditioned restaurants threatened to exhaust me. I was at first wary of the intense perfume of this infusion, but before long I was addicted. The steaming, fragrant tea was hydrating and reviving, and a great accompaniment to spicy foods. Jasmine tea is essentially green tea, which comes from the same plant as standard black tea, but the leaves are unoxidised. This means it's lighter in flavour and colour. It also has less caffeine (though still some) and is especially high in antioxidants (some US doctors consider three cups of green tea wholesome enough to constitute one of our daily fruit and veg portions). Inferior brands are green leaf simply sprayed with a synthetic perfume. The good stuff is infused by being mingled with freshly picked jasmine flowers, then dried - the process being repeated several times. I struggled to find a brew as good as the ones I drank in Singapore until a friend introduced me to Jing Tea's jasmine pearls. These little grey balls, when steeped in water for five minutes off the boil, release a deep but delicate flavour. More than a reviving drink, this tea is so fragrant, it encourages a mid-afternoon ritual - pretty china cup, a moment of peace. You can capture the unique perfume in other ways, too: try infusing it in a custard or syrup. Order from jingtea.co.uk or search out the good stuff in Chinese groceries.",

        "original_text": "One of the four former owners of MG Rover is helping Nanjing Automobile bid for assets of the failed Birmingham carmaker, just two months after the Chinese company chose not to go ahead with a planned rescue. Nick Stephenson, vice- chairman of Phoenix Venture Holdings, Rover's parent company, is advising the Nanjing bid for parts of Rover being sold by PwC, the administrators. His support is likely to be controversial as Nanjing was junior partner in a rescue plan led by Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp before Rover's collapse in April. The failure of the Chinese companies to complete the planned joint venture due to financial concerns, precipitated the carmaker's demise. Mr Stephenson, with other Phoenix directors, was widely blamed for failing to fix Rover's problems and a government investigation is under way into whether there was any wrongdoing at the company. Rover enthusiasts have accused the Chinese of \"cherry-picking\" the best bits of Rover, leaving more than 5,500 former workers unemployed while buying car and engine designs. However, Mr Stephenson is not being paid by the Chinese company and would not receive a stake in the business if Nanjing succeeded, according to Phoenix, which is still trading. \"Nick Stephenson has been advising on an unpaid basis Nanjing Auto with the full approval of PwC,\" Phoenix said. \"There is no business relationship between Phoenix and Nanjing.\" Nanjing entered the bidding late, but a group of its executives is thought to have visited Rover's Longbridge factory in Birmingham last week. It remains unclear whether Nanjing wants to buy equipment or try to restart production, and the company could not be contacted for comment last night. Under the previous plan Nanjing would have produced small Rovers at a factory in China. Nanjing is one of China's weaker carmakers, as its joint venture with Italy's Fiat has performed poorly. Money raised from the sale of Rover would benefit Phoenix, as the carmaker's biggest creditor, by increasing the likelihood of a payout by administrators. Phoenix has promised to put any money raised, with its remaining assets, into a trust fund for former workers. SAIC is also trying to buy some former Rover equipment, bidding for the assets of Powertrain, the engine business. SAIC bought the designs for the engines and Rover-brand cars last year for Pounds 67m in what was supposed to be the first stage of the rescue, a move which presents a barrier to a sale of the production lines to anyone else. The sale of the intellectual property rights has led to claims from former Rover workers and enthusiasts that the Chinese got what they wanted cheaply without having to take on the liabilities of the loss-making company, something SAIC denies. The only other confirmed bidders are a management buy-out team, which wants the MG-branded sports cars and the racing division, and Nikolai Smolenski, owner of TVR, who wants to revive production at Longbridge. Mr Stephenson has been heavily criticised by MPs, trade unions and workers over the Pounds 40m the four directors of Phoenix paid themselves since buying Rover for Pounds 10 from BMW in 2000.",

        "original_text": "President George W. Bush and his South Korean counterpart, Roh Moo Hyun, exchanged diplomatic pleasantries at their summit in Washington last Friday. Bush noted that both countries \"share the same goal\" of getting North Korea to give up its nuclear-weapons program, and that both agree that the long-stalled six-party talks are \"essential\" to that process. Roh said that the United States and South Korea had \"one or two minor issues\" about how to deal with North Korea's nuclear program, \"but I'm certain we'll be able to work them out with dialogue.\" Before leaving for Washington, Roh had sought to reassure observers that all was well in his country's alliance with the United States. Roh invited a delegation of American generals over to lunch, where he talked glowingly about U.S.-Korean friendship. Diplomats and pro-government parliamentarians were similarly enthusiastic. The day before Roh's trip, his office issued a statement expressing the hope that the summit would \"reinforce\" the alliance and \"eliminate all misunderstandings and concerns.\" Words alone, however, are unlikely to heal what is in fact a growing rift between the two nations. Washington and Seoul are struggling to bridge very different positions over how to handle North Korea--and that's not the only problem that divides them. For one thing, the United States wants to respond more proactively to global security threats, which could draw in the American troops stationed on the Korean Peninsula. Japan is willing to help; in a recent agreement with the Bush administration, for example, Tokyo called Taiwan a \"common strategic objective.\" That comes at a time when South Korea and Japan are at loggerheads over control of several small islands, as well as Tokyo's perceived refusal to apologize for World War II atrocities. Meanwhile, such tensions as well as booming trade with China are pushing Seoul closer to Beijing on several issues, including what to do about the North's nuclear ambitions. Relations between Washington and Seoul have seldom been placid, of course. Owing to their long history of victimization by outsiders, South Koreans have often bridled at their junior place in the alliance, while the Americans have often found their patience tried by unpredictable dictators or nationalist demonstrators. But somehow the two sides have always worked out their differences--and what usually got them back together was the threat from Pyongyang. The South didn't want to see a reprise of the Korean War, while the United States was eager to contain the regional threat of communism and to protect its own strategic position in East Asia. These days, it's not clear if that old surety still holds true. The catchword in Seoul these days is \"engagement\" with the North, meaning a policy of incentives and cooperation (such as joint business and tourism ventures along the border) designed to reassure Pyongyang and nudge Kim Jong Il's regime into rational behavior. That policy has little support in Washington; when asked about offering the North further incentives to return to six-party talks on the nuclear issue, Bush said there were already \"plenty of incentives\" in a U.S. proposal that's been on the table for a year. Administration neoconservatives like Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld prefer a tough, somewhat confrontational approach to Pyongyang, and often declare that the only way to fix North Korea is by dismantling the system. Instead of engaging Kim Jong Il, they'd rather haul his regime before the United Nations Security Council. Such antipodal positions have sparked questions about more than Pyongyang's nukes. \"Both countries see the North Korean nuclear issue as a threat,\" notes Han Sung Joo, a former South Korean ambassador to Washington. \"[But] the U.S. is mostly concerned about the threat of proliferation. South Korea is concerned because it could lead to military conflict.\" Notes Seoul-based Peter Beck of the International Crisis Group: \"When you have these diametrically opposed world views, the best you can do is paper over the differences. Planners on both sides are beginning to ask questions they weren't contemplating four or five years ago. Will the bilateral security relationship survive? Is it just a matter of time before all U.S. troops leave? If the relationship isn't managed well on both sides, divorce is a real possibility.\" An exaggeration? Perhaps. But Beck and other skeptics worry that the issues now confronting Seoul and Washington are fundamental rather than cosmetic. Case in point: a recent feud over contingency planning in the event that the North Korean regime should collapse. Among other things, past plans have detailed how the allied forces would respond to refugee flows or move to secure weapons from the North Korean nuclear arsenal. But when the United States declared earlier this year that it was time to update the plan (known as OPLAN 5029), the South Korean government balked--and then leaked the news of its stonewalling to the local press. U.S. planners were furious, even if some acknowledge that they might just have had it coming after Rumsfeld blindsided the Roh administration last summer by announcing a round of cuts in U.S. troop strength on the peninsula without informing Seoul beforehand. The deeper reason for South Korea's reluctance, say analysts, was its unwillingness to sign off on anything that could provide Bush administration hawks with a blank check to launch strikes against the North. Chung Eui Yong, a foreign-affairs specialist in the ruling Uri Party's parliamentary delegation, warns that Washington ought to be drawing two lessons from the brouhaha: don't act unilaterally and don't resort to military solutions. Says Chung: \"We need assurances on these two points from our American friends.\" Or take the issue of \"strategic flexibility.\" Earlier this year Rumsfeld's planners informed their South Korean counterparts that the United States wanted to be able to deploy forces or equipment based in the South to any part of the world where they might be needed. Washington basically expected the Koreans to take note of the idea and nod their approval. But South Korean lawmakers and government officials were livid about the Pentagon's cavalier approach. Bruce Klingner, a Korea expert with the Eurasia Group, contends that the United States has failed to understand the growing assertiveness of the new generation of South Korean politicians eager to capitalize on their country's economic and political clout. \"We're still treating them as we did in the past--a bit condescendingly,\" says Klingner. \"It's the analogy of the teenager who's grown up but is still being treated like a child.\" Even more essentially, he notes, Seoul worries that giving the United States carte blanche could drag the South into fights against its will. The biggest fear: war with China, particularly in the event of a clash over Taiwan. That reluctance is particularly understandable considering the growing range of interests shared by Beijing and Seoul. Last year China replaced the United States as South Korea's most important trade partner. For each of the past three years, China has received more foreign investment from South Korean firms than any other country. Two million South Korean tourists visited China last year, and more Korean students (some 35,000) are now studying in China than in the United States. Members of the Roh administration insist that they're not moving closer to China. But both Beijing and Seoul are terrified of the ripple effects of a possible North Korean collapse, and both have correspondingly worked to moderate U.S. efforts to exert pressure on the North. While Japan has been an enthusiastic participant in Washington's Proliferation Security Initiative, designed to thwart any North Korean attempts to export weapons of mass destruction, China and South Korea have both opted out. And, of course, both nations have grievances with Japan. All of which has led both Seoul and Beijing to join forces in lobbying against Japan's application for a seat on the U.N. Security Council. The Bush administration supports Japan's U.N. ambition. Some observers say that his country's growing closeness to China is one reason for President Roh's decision to declare a new geopolitical role for South Korea in the region. In a now notorious speech this spring, Roh announced that it was time for the South to start working as a \"balancer\" in Northeast Asia. The formula offered room for multiple interpretations, but most viewed the president as arguing the case for more distance from the United States--and more coziness with Beijing. \"That was yet another disturbing signal for Washington,\" says Beck. Those suspicions have only been aggravated by Seoul's efforts to intensify military relations with China. When the South Korean Defense Minister Yoon Gwang Woong visited China in early April, the two sides approved a range of confidence-building measures-- including a pledge to \"expand military cooperation.\" \"How can Korea play China as a counter card to the U.S.?\" asks Park Jin, an opposition member of the South Korean Parliament. \"I don't think we should consider China as a counterweight to the U.S. It might confuse the Chinese as well as the Americans. But that's the direction the government is moving in now.\" Responds Uri Party member Chung: \"We have to be close to China--that's our destiny.\" So how to move beyond the public-relations gloss of last week's summit? Eurasia Group analyst Klingner says that it should be theoretically possible for the divergent North Korea policies--U.S. containment and South Korean engagement--to be integrated into a \"coordinated strategy.\" But that would require delicate diplomatic management, shared information and good strategic vision--all the ingredients missing now. What's ironic is that America has much to do with its ally's newfound independence. Says parliamentarian Chung, \"Thanks to [the Americans'] own success in Korea there are a lot of different voices here now. It's democracy.\" And right now, it's rocking a partnership that has helped to keep the peace in Asia.",

Both leaders stated their shared goal of persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program and emphasized the importance of the stalled six-party talks. Roh acknowledged minor differences in approach between the U.S. and South Korea but expressed confidence in resolving them through dialogue. Before the summit, Roh met with U.S. generals and discussed bilateral relations, while his office released a statement hoping to strengthen the alliance and address concerns.\n\nThe two countries face challenges in aligning their strategies toward North Korea. The U.S. favors a proactive stance on global security threats, while South Korea emphasizes engagement with the North through incentives and cooperation. The U.S. has proposed existing incentives for North Korea to rejoin negotiations, whereas some U.S. officials advocate for a more confrontational approach, including potential U.N. Security Council involvement.\n\nDifferences extend beyond North Korea policy. The U.S. and South Korea have disagreed on contingency planning for potential instability in North Korea, with Seoul resisting measures it views as granting the U.S. unilateral military authority. Additionally, discussions over the strategic flexibility of U.S. forces in South Korea have raised concerns in Seoul about unintended involvement in regional conflicts, particularly involving Taiwan.\n\nSouth Korea’s economic ties with China have strengthened, with China becoming its largest trading partner. This has led to closer diplomatic coordination between Seoul and Beijing on issues like North Korea and Japan’s U.N. Security Council bid. South Korean officials deny any deliberate shift toward China but acknowledge shared interests in regional stability.\n\nPresident Roh’s remarks about South Korea serving as a \"balancer\" in Northeast Asia, along with increased military cooperation with China, have raised questions in Washington about the future of U.S.-South Korea relations. Analysts suggest that policy differences could be managed through coordinated strategy, but this would require improved communication and mutual trust.\n\nObservers note that South Korea’s democratic development has led to a more assertive foreign policy. While the U.S.-South Korea alliance has historically been underpinned by shared security concerns, evolving regional dynamics present new challenges for bilateral cooperation."

        "original_text": "Washington -- CHINA'S RISE is creating fissures among Republicans in Congress over how the U.S. should respond. The rifts mirror some within the Bush administration. But Chinese government officials seem more concerned these days with those in Congress, where passions about potential foreign rivals can sometimes force through harsher policies. The emerging blocs in Congress are divided between military hawks who portray Beijing as a potential strategic threat and the Chamber of Commerce camp, which tends to see the Asian giant as a great economic opportunity. Two different congressional groups were launched earlier this year to analyze and shape the policy debate over China's surging economic and political clout. The 31-member China Congressional Caucus, focusing on the People's Liberation Army's military modernization, is headed by Rep. J. Randy Forbes, a Virginia Republican. When discussing China, he mentions a scene from the movie \"Jaws,\" in which the police chief nonchalantly throws fish bait into waters off the New England coast. A great white shark lunges out of the water, terrifying the audience. \"That's kind of what China did to the world,\" says Mr. Forbes. Illinois Republican Rep. Mark Kirk heads the 35-member U.S.-China Study Group. He says his group's main goal is to \"reduce needless conflict with China based on wrong information.\" While the congressman says China's military upgrade is \"profound and it's worrying,\" he argues that U.S. trade and diplomatic ties will turn \"China into a less-menacing state.\" Healthy economic ties are also good for his district in Chicago, where three giant U.S. corporate players in China -- Boeing Co., Motorola Inc. and United Airlines parent UAL Corp. -- have their headquarters. The two factions clashed earlier this year over a House resolution opposing the bid by Chinese state oil company Cnooc Ltd. to buy U.S. oil producer Unocal Corp., a deal that failed in part because of congressional opposition. Mr. Forbes says he backed the measure, which passed by a 398-to-15 vote, because the Cnooc takeover could have threatened U.S. access to oil supplies. He also says it would have given the Chinese \"monitoring capabilities\" for U.S. military installations near drilling sites in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Kirk opposed the resolution, arguing that much criticism of the deal was based on inaccurate information. He says many legislators didn't realize that most of Unocal's oil and gas exploration activities were no longer based in the U.S. and that Beijing allowed American oil companies to invest in China. The differing approaches to China on Capitol Hill mirror similar strains developing within the Bush administration. Two weeks ago, Treasury Secretary John Snow visited China, praising the government for economic restructuring and playing down congressional criticism over Chinese currency policy. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld arrived in China for his own visit last week, after months in which the Pentagon has bluntly criticized China's military buildup as potentially destabilizing for Asia. While Mr. Rumsfeld's remarks in a speech in China were less critical, he still fretted about Beijing's rising military power, saying that it \"leads other nations to question China's intentions.\" But these days, Chinese government officials are watching the split in Congress to see which group dominates -- the one run by Rep. Forbes or the one championed by Rep. Kirk. Both men were elected to Congress in 2000. Mr. Forbes, 53 years old, was a lawyer in southeastern Virginia before entering politics. Mr. Kirk, 46, had a history in international relations, as a Naval Reserve intelligence officer, in posts at the World Bank and the State Department, and as an aide in the British House of Commons. Mr. Forbes tends to vote with the Republican Party's most conservative wing on economic, social and foreign-policy legislation, according to an analysis by the National Journal, a nonpartisan political magazine. Mr. Kirk, by the same study, splits his votes more evenly between conservatives and liberals. Mr. Kirk praises Mr. Forbes's efforts for helping to focus more attention on China. Mr. Forbes criticizes the Kirk caucus as \"cheerleaders\" who \"want more trade with China\" that ultimately could provide Beijing the income to build its military machine. Mr. Forbes, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, says in an interview that \"we still don't know if China will be our best friend or our worst enemy.\" Chinese officials say they need to modernize the military to block Taiwan -- which Beijing considers a breakaway province -- from declaring independence. But Mr. Forbes is convinced that China's recent purchases of diesel submarines and development of missiles are \"much bigger than Taiwan.\" He argues that the upgrading of China's military poses \"a huge threat\" and is \"all focused on the United States.\" While he doesn't have specific policies to propose at this point, Mr. Forbes urges the Bush administration to do a more thorough assessment of China's impact on the American \"military-industrial base\" and how it should respond to China during the next decade. He emphasizes the need for a long-term shipbuilding plan for the Navy to compete with China's active program. With a major shipbuilding center nearby, his district is home to many shipbuilding workers. Rep. Kirk, who first visited Beijing in 1984 as a congressional aide, says his group's main policy objective is to make U.S. relations with China the top diplomatic priority in Washington, as opposed to what he considers the current overemphasis on relations with Europe. \"The two largest economies on earth should place the highest priorities on relations to each other,\" he says. His group -- whose co-chairman is Washington State Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen -- supports increasing the resources available to the State Department to bolster the number of Chinese-language speakers in the foreign service, upgrade the U.S. Embassy's Web site in Beijing to cater to the \"Internet addiction\" of Chinese under the age of 40, and set up consulates in all Chinese cities with a population of more than 10 million. China appears to appreciate the friendly outlook of Mr. Kirk's caucus. China's new ambassador to Washington, Zhou Wenzhong, has coffee regularly with the group. Its members were slated to have a 90- minute meeting in September with Chinese President Hu Jintao, before his visit to Washington was postponed after Hurricane Katrina. Mr. Forbes hasn't yet met with Mr. Zhou. Two attempts were canceled because of scheduling conflicts. His group wasn't offered a meeting with Mr. Hu. --- Two Perspectives on China",
        "debiased_text": "Washington -- Divisions have emerged among Republicans in Congress regarding the U.S. response to China's growing influence. Similar disagreements exist within the Bush administration. Chinese officials appear particularly attentive to congressional debates, where policy discussions can lead to more stringent measures. Congressional views on China are divided between those who emphasize potential strategic concerns and those who prioritize economic opportunities. Two formal groups were established this year to examine China's increasing economic and political influence. The 31-member China Congressional Caucus, led by Virginia Republican Rep. J. Randy Forbes, focuses on China's military modernization. Separately, the 35-member U.S.-China Study Group, headed by Illinois Republican Rep. Mark Kirk, aims to reduce potential conflicts through improved information sharing. Earlier this year, these factions disagreed on a House resolution opposing Chinese state oil company Cnooc Ltd.'s bid for U.S. oil producer Unocal Corp., which ultimately failed. Rep. Forbes supported the resolution, citing potential impacts on U.S. oil access and security concerns. Rep. Kirk opposed it, arguing that criticisms were based on incomplete information. Similar policy differences exist within the Bush administration, with Treasury Secretary John Snow recently praising China's economic reforms while Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has expressed concerns about China's military expansion. Both Rep. Forbes (a former lawyer) and Rep. Kirk (with background in international relations) were elected in 2000. Voting records show Rep. Forbes aligns with conservative positions more consistently, while Rep. Kirk's votes are more varied. Rep. Forbes emphasizes analyzing China's military development and its potential effects on U.S. security, while Rep. Kirk advocates prioritizing U.S.-China relations and increasing diplomatic resources. The Chinese government has engaged more frequently with Rep. Kirk's group, including planned but postponed meetings with senior officials. Rep. Forbes has not yet met with China's ambassador to Washington."

        "original_text": "In the passage of time between the two great Christian religious festivals of Christmas and Easter, the issue of religious broadcasting, and what constitutes blasphemy in Britain in 2005, has burst into flames and, in so doing, changed the media landscape. In January, BBC2 broadcast Jerry Springer - the Opera, provoking a tabloid furore, and it is now facing a potential judicial challenge as the governors steel themselves this month to answer a record 50,000 complaints. Meanwhile, Ofcom, which abruptly allowed ITV to kill off My Favourite Hymns and halve its religious output from this week without public consultation - raising questions about its conduct over sensitive content issues - is also pondering a record 8,857 Springer complaints. You sense Ofcom would rather rule on competition issues than whether \"fuck\" and \"crucifixion\" can be used in the same sentence at 10pm, or if Eve \"masturbating\" Jesus on BBC2 causes harm and offence - but that is the new reality. The BBC complaints also include one significant letter, carefully crafted by the Bishop of Manchester, Nigel McCulloch, and widely supported by the rest of the clergy. This senior bishop, now sitting on the House of Lords committee vetting the BBC green paper, is taking the responsibility very seriously. Meanwhile, for all the BBC's defiant words about the right to broadcast provocative pieces for a broad audience, director general Mark Thompson used a keynote speech this month to agree it was time to do more to \"connect\" with Christian viewers and plug a \"creative deficit\" in a nation where 72% of the population say they are in some sense Christian. But the furore, which could easily be replicated again in multi-faith Britain, has raised a further question: what input has there been from a broadly based and carefully balanced body, the Central Religious Advisory Committee (Crac), there to advise the BBC, and, it is assumed, Ofcom about such elephant traps? Which leads straight to Graham James, Bishop of Norwich, who exactly a year ago became chair of Crac. Predictably, Bishop James, speaking from the historic Bishop's House in Norwich, did not care much for Springer. \"I didn't think it made good television. Televising plays direct from the theatre is rarely a good idea. I found it tasteless, but I find the real Jerry Springer programme equally tasteless.\" But, perhaps less predictably, the bishop was more offended by the crude content of the Vicar Of Dibley Christmas special. \"I thought the initial series very good. I thought the last Christmas Day edition more seriously offensive than Jerry Springer. The jokes about Jesus were in pretty poor taste and the drunken performances at midnight mass lost touch with reality. They were not comedy, and not quite farce.\" The bishop reveals that neither he nor Crac was asked for advice by the BBC about Jerry Springer - The Opera. \"Given Crac exists it seems odd we were not used at all in the run-up. I'm not sure the BBC saw it coming. It got caught out by the scale of protest.\" The bishop says the BBC should have turned to his committee once the level of the protest had become clear. \"What the BBC could have done is say they are asking Crac to review the BBC's internal decision-making process. How is an internal review to decide if something is blasphemous? Where are the BBC executives who know how to judge these things?\" The Springer row left Crac on the sidelines, with all the running being made by Christian Voice, a small but vocal pressure group based in west Wales. As one very senior opinion former in the Church of England says, the row has damaged Crac's standing. \"What's the point of Crac? We are puzzled about Crac's status, it seems to have completely lost out, moved to a twilight zone.\" It is a sentiment reinforced by Bishop James's surprise when ITV so swiftly won the argument to halve its religious programming. He was on holiday in Australia, and not formally consulted or informed. If only they had asked, broadcasters would have found that the bishop has strong and progressive views on how religion could be covered on television. \"Religion is one of the great phenomena of the world for millions and millions and yet people represent religious broadcasting as dull. There is a huge amount to be done to produce more exciting programmes - a need for a mission to educate.\" Bishop James believes that a prevailing liberal, sceptical view is stifling innovation. \"The western secular liberal mindset seems to dominate broadcasting - and for that matter a paper like the Guardian. They gave up on religion some 30 years ago, and thought that as we all became more prosperous and so on, it would die away.\" He says this mindset also informed Ofcom's public service broadcasting review, which paved the way for the TV cutbacks. \"I think there were some quite unsophisticated questions about whether people valued religious broad casting. It is not fashionable to say you like religious broadcasting, yet if you asked people if they are interested in spirituality you might have a very different reply. \"The truth is that far from falling, religions are resurgent. Look at Islam, in China, as prosperity rises it is also resurgent and this is quite apart from what is happening in the US.\" The bishop insists that debates about the coverage of religion on television need not revolve around the relative merits of each one. \"It is not whether all religions are true, or not. They can't all be true. It's whether religion matters in people's lives. The number of communicants on a wet February Sunday morning in the Church of England are more than the members of the Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat political parties. We are a mass movement by comparison.\" Bishop James is also critical of the quality of coverage in news programmes. \"ITV and the BBC maintain huge investment in news and current affairs, and in correspondents, yet their secular news gathering makes chronic mistakes. I would like to see religious broadcasting departments with informed journalists in them, to make the connections between the minority world of religious broadcasting and the wider issues. For example, I think the reporting of Iraq carried very little about the differences between Shia and Sunni Muslims, let alone the Christians, and the reporting of Syria has been even more seriously neglectful of the Syrian Christian population.\" On a more upbeat note he says that although the BBC has taken a long time to develop programmes to address the religious deficit, \"there's been quite a shift at the top with the arrival of Michael Grade and Thompson. I don't think religion was taken at all seriously by Greg (Dyke). It wasn't top of his agenda - it was not on his agenda. I sense things have changed - there's been a decision that religion does matter. It can't be sidelined to one or two hours a week and end up in a ghetto.\" Bishop James says Crac is meeting the BBC and Ofcom on May 4 and 5, for the standard six-monthly meeting, and he clearly has a big agenda, including Jerry Springer, which extends to how Ofcom handles religious complaints. Last month's Channel 4 programme featuring live exorcism is a case in point: he says it may have breached programme guidelines. \"The relationship between Crac and Ofcom is being worked out. One of the things we do need to do is establish where Crac stands in relation to Ofcom decisions. What does need discussion is how Ofcom reaches its decisions under the Communications Act.\" Ofcom responds that its main board has no statutory duty to consult with Crac, which began life more than 40 years ago as a committee selected by the BBC to advise the BBC and was adopted by the Independent Broadcasting Authority and then Independent Television Commission for a joint role. There is also a BBC belief that Crac cannot advise two regulators. Bishop James adds that Crac members work pro bono, and the committee is not resourced to handle the deluge of documents sent out by Ofcom. Nor does it have a direct relationship with ITV, whose delivery of commitments in statements of programme policy it is expected to comment on. But Bishop James is known as an incisive man, who rose from humble origins in Cornwall. He has a modernising agenda. He was in two minds as to whether to defend My Favourite Hymns when it was axed. \"Looking back at ITV's record on religious broadcasting, it has consistently provided Sunday worship. I feel between a rock and a hard place arguing for prescribed slots, protected hours, because it gives the impression that religious broadcasting is an endangered species, a bit like a minority sport.\" The danger, he says, is that \"religion is put into a broadcasting siding, which has led to religious broadcasting being marginalised\" - a banishment that explains the old-fashionedness of the programmes. Yet he defends the place of worship on ITV, something which makes some senior people at Ofcom uncomfortable. \"The Communications Act requires some complete acts of worship and it would be very odd if they didn't broadcast communal acts of worship. It is something very many people do. It's not a cult secret, and it is not there just for the housebound.\" So where does Crac go from here? \"Crac stands outside both Ofcom and the BBC, though its membership is determined by both bodies consulting each other. I value Crac's independence. We are not regulators ourselves. I do think Crac would be more effective if better resourced. But who would resource it more fully without Crac sacrificing its independence? \"I think both the BBC and Ofcom have realised that religion requires specialist advice, not simply in relation to religious broadcasting but the presentation of religion in all areas of broadcasting. Crac has all the major faiths represented on the committee and the degree of unanimity is very striking.\" And he returns to the wider point. \"We are in an age where religion is a more sensitive issue than in the past. Crac's involvement should be of very great use. It seems odd to maintain a group and not use it as creatively as possible.\" Brave words, intelligent words, but from a twilight zone?

        "debiased_text": "Between the Christian holidays of Christmas and Easter in 2005, discussions about religious broadcasting and blasphemy in Britain gained prominence, leading to shifts in media dynamics. In January, BBC2 aired *Jerry Springer - The Opera*, which resulted in approximately 50,000 complaints. The BBC is now preparing to address these complaints formally. Separately, Ofcom received 8,857 complaints about the same program after permitting ITV to reduce its religious programming, including canceling *My Favourite Hymns*, without public consultation. The Bishop of Manchester, Nigel McCulloch, submitted a letter expressing concerns, backed by other clergy members, and the BBC's director general, Mark Thompson, acknowledged the need to better engage Christian viewers. Meanwhile, questions arose about the role of the Central Religious Advisory Committee (Crac), which advises on religious broadcasting matters. Graham James, Bishop of Norwich and chair of Crac, criticized *Jerry Springer - The Opera* as poor television but found the *Vicar of Dibley* Christmas special more offensive. He noted that Crac was not consulted before the broadcast and suggested the BBC should have sought its input after complaints emerged. The Christian Voice group also played a role in the controversy, overshadowing Crac in the debate. Bishop James further commented on ITV's reduction of religious programming, which was implemented without consulting Crac. He called for more dynamic religious programming and criticized news coverage for lacking religious context, citing reporting on Iraq and Syria as examples. Crac is scheduled to meet with the BBC and Ofcom in May to discuss these issues, including Ofcom’s handling of religious complaints, such as Channel 4’s recent exorcism program. Ofcom stated that it is not legally required to consult Crac, which originated over 40 years ago as an advisory body for the BBC. Bishop James emphasized Crac’s independence but acknowledged its limited resources and the challenges of advising both the BBC and Ofcom. He advocated for preserving religious programming on ITV and called for more informed journalism on religious topics. Crac’s membership includes representatives from major faiths, and Bishop James highlighted the need for specialist advice on religious matters in broadcasting. The committee’s members include leaders from Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Sikh, Hindu, Buddhist, and interfaith organizations."

        "original_text": "Dow Jones Newswires A three-horse race is emerging over the possible acquisition of PetroKazakhstan Inc., a Canada-based oil company with a market value of about 3.5 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.9 billion), people close to the situation say. PetroChina Co., China's biggest oil producer in terms of production, and OAO Lukoil, Russia's biggest oil producer, are the leading likely bidders for PetroKazakhstan, these people say. Both own producing oil fields in Kazakhstan, where PetroKazakhstan produces and refines crude oil, and are keen to expand their interests. India's ONGC Videsh Ltd., the international arm of state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp. has also signaled interest in acquiring the company. Yesterday, a company spokesman said management is currently evaluating PetroKazakhstan, adding, \"There's a very bright chance that we will be bidding for it.\" However, the company is viewed as a dark horse in the bidding process as it has no interests in Kazakhstan and a less established relationship with the government. PetroKazakhstan declined to comment on the situation. If a buyout is concluded, the transaction would likely be the oil- and-natural-gas sector's second-biggest deal this year in value terms, behind the bidding war for Unocal Corp. by Chevron Corp. and China's Cnooc Ltd. which has attracted offers close to US$20 billion. Up for grabs is a company that was producing 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day before state-imposed restrictions kicked in, with proven and probable reserves topping 550 million barrels. PetroKazakhstan's midsize refinery produces 80,000 barrels of refined products a day. PetroChina has said it is interested in the sale process, while Lukoil, already a joint-venture partner with PetroKazakhstan in one oil field, has said it will consider it. However, it is unlikely that a deal for PetroKazakhstan will be struck before September or October given the complexities of getting approval from the Kazakhstan government in order to close a transaction. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is the financial adviser to PetroKazakhstan, of Calgary, Alberta, and is fielding takeover interest. People close to Lukoil say the Russian oil major doesn't want to confirm its interest for fear it will ramp up PetroKazakhstan's share price, which has risen more than 40% since mid-May, partly on takeover speculation. Like many oil-producing countries, Kazakhstan is strengthening control of its hydrocarbons sector as prices rise, often in the form of taking direct equity stakes. PetroKazakhstan's suitors may decide to bid in a consortium with KazMunaiGaz, Kazakhstan's state oil-and- natural-gas company, as a junior partner, according to the people familiar with the situation. It is unclear whether other suitors will step forward given the heavy presence and strong relationships that both PetroChina and Lukoil have in Kazakhstan. A person familiar with Lukoil's thinking said the Russian company believes its outstanding lawsuits against PetroKazakhstan will discourage buyers other than itself. The company is locked in a dispute with Lukoil over rights to oil production from a jointly owned oil field in Kazakhstan's Turgai region. Lukoil works closely with the administration of Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Lukoil has stakes in the Karachaganak and Tengiz projects and is in a 50-50 partnership with PetroKazakhstan in Turgai Petroleum, which is developing the North Kumkol field. Lukoil is also a shareholder in a Caspian pipeline that carries Kazakh crude to the Black Sea and is exploring for oil and gas together with Kazakh companies in the Caspian basin. PetroChina and KazMunaiGaz are partners in the construction of an oil pipeline from Kazakhstan to China, and PetroChina has a handful of oil production and exploration licenses in the Central Asian country. PetroKazakhstan's fortunes have soured in recent months. It was ordered to trim production at its Turgai oil field joint venture to meet new guidelines on gas flaring. In addition, the Kazakh tax authorities have presented the company with tens of millions of dollars in back-tax bills. --- Benoit Faucon and David Gauthier-Villars contributed to this article.",

Both companies operate oil fields in Kazakhstan, where PetroKazakhstan is active in production and refining. India's ONGC Videsh Ltd., the international division of state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp., has also expressed interest in acquiring the company but is seen as less likely due to its limited presence in Kazakhstan.

Lukoil has not publicly confirmed its bid to avoid affecting PetroKazakhstan's share price, which has risen over 40% since mid-May amid takeover speculation. Kazakhstan has been increasing state control over its energy sector, and potential bidders may partner with state-owned KazMunaiGaz. Legal disputes between Lukoil and PetroKazakhstan over oil field rights in Kazakhstan’s Turgai region could influence the sale. PetroChina and KazMunaiGaz collaborate on an oil pipeline project from Kazakhstan to China, while Lukoil holds stakes in several Kazakh energy ventures. PetroKazakhstan has faced operational and financial challenges, including production cuts due to gas flaring regulations and tax disputes with Kazakh authorities."

Chinese people are so clever.” We are two hours, several beers and half a roasted duck into a journey on the overnight express from Xining, travelling along the completed half of what will soon be part of the world’s highest railroad - the 1,900km line from Xining across the Qinghai Plateau to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. But my patriotic conversation partner, Wang Qiang, is just warming up on his favourite subject: China’s engineering prowess. “The new track follows the highway built by our soldiers in the 1950s. The terrain is so harsh that three of them died for every kilometre of road. You have to admire their spirit. But now, we’ve built the railway without the loss of a single life.

He is as keen to demonstrate the conviviality of China as he is to wax lyrical about the country’s strength. As well as cracking open a bottle of beer and sharing his food, he offers a packet of Dongfanghong cigarettes - “I smoke these because it was Mao’s favourite brand” - and travel advice: “Actually, there isn’t much in Qinghai.

Some play cards, others sing with their children, a curious few chat with a Tibetan monk. And when that entertainment runs out, several attempt to talk to me. They are engagingly friendly. A family from Xining pours a pot of instant noodles and offers sightseeing tips. Two young sightseers from Hong Kong share their herbal remedies for altitude sickness and talk enviously about the mainland. “There is an amazing can-do spirit in China these days,” says Susan Hong, a maths teacher. “We used to have a bit of that in Hong Kong. But now we are so conservative compared to the mainland. Anything seems possible in China these days. It’s very exciting.” As I get ready to turn in, Wang qualifies the level of his friendliness. “I am happy to share food and drink with you. We are friends with all countries now. Except Japan. If you were Japanese I would not share my food with you. And I would not let you sleep in the bunk above me.” Perhaps it is the lack of oxygen here at 3,000m above sea level or the frequent patrols by ticket inspectors, but I have trouble getting to sleep. Instead, my mind races across the day’s contrasting impressions: the warmth of my fellow passengers, the sometimes scary nationalism of Wang, the can-do spirit. China is a nation on the move. But should its economic growth be cause for alarm? Other nations have risen fast - Britain during the industrial revolution, the US at the turn of the century, and Japan during and after the 1960s. However, it took Britain 100 years to rise; 60 for the US and 30 for Japan. It seems China will be transformed in just a couple of decades. And it is not just the speed of change that is turning heads, but the scale. China has the world’s biggest population: 1.3 billion. Now those billions are travelling, earning and consuming more than ever before, and pessimists fear the world will be overrun by an eastern horde. Others, however, view China as the nation most capable of extending the limits of human civilisation in centuries to come. This is where development is progressing fastest. This is where the biggest risks are taken, where the impossible seems possible. The railway to Tibet is one of the greatest symbols of that spirit. Since it was built in 1984, the route from Xining, the provincial capital of Qinghai Province, to Golmud, the garrison town in China’s wild west, has been the train to nowhere. No one, it was believed, could build a line any further across the Qinghai plateau, certainly not one all the way to Tibet. It was too bleak, too cold, too high, too oxygen-starved. Even the best Swiss tunnelling engineers concluded that it was impossible to bore through the rock and ice of the Kunlun mountain range. If that were not enough, even the flats were filled with perils. A metre or so below the surface was a thick layer of permafrost; above this, a layer of ice that melts and refreezes with the seasons and the rising and setting of the sun. How could anyone build a track on that? And how could a regular service be run in an area plagued by sandstorms in the summer and blizzards in the winter? As the great train traveller Paul Theroux wrote in Riding the Iron Rooster, these challenges are why the former Himalayan kingdom of Tibet - on the other side of the plateau - has remained unspoilt and so un-Chinese for so long. “The Kunlun Range is a guarantee that the railway will never get to Lhasa. That is probably a good thing. I thought I liked railways until I saw Tibet, and then I realised that I liked wilderness much more.” But that guarantee no longer applies. Next month - three years ahead of schedule - Chinese engineers will lay the final section of track on a line stretching to Lhasa, across the roof of the world. Test runs will begin on the new line next July and commercial services are scheduled to begin within two years. Lhasa (3,650m above sea level) The Tibetan capital is the obvious starting point if you want to understand what the railway will mean - for the Chinese and for the Tibetans. Just as in the US 100 years ago, the tracks are at the heart of a plan to consolidate central control over a wild west. The settlers are from China’s Han ethnic majority rather than Europeans, and the natives are Tibetans rather than Cherokee, but Beijing’s policy is just as much about the imposition of the dominant culture as it is about economic development. Two years ago I joined a government-organised tour of this ancient city in the clouds, the home of Tibetan Buddhism. Lhasa was already starting to look like any other town in China, with broad roads, huge white-tiled buildings and multi-coloured street lamps in the shape of palm trees. It was a garish clash of two cultures - the modern materialism of China and the medieval spiritualism of Tibet. The railway, then two years into construction, looked certain to intensify this clash. Tibetans seemed divided. For independence activists, the railway would open the biggest channel yet for the influx of soldiers, traders and other sources of materialist Han pollution. Tenzin Metok Sither, a spokeswoman for the Free Tibet Campaign, said it would add to the already tense political situation. “This is a highly strategic project that seeks to tighten Beijing’s control over Tibet and will serve to further marginalise Tibetans economically and culturally.” Others, however, grudgingly acknowledge the good that the trains might bring. I was surprised to find a living Buddha make one of the strongest arguments in favour of the railway. “We’ve been too backward, too isolated for too long,” said the lama, who asked that his name not be used. “The rest of the world is in the 21st century. We are still in the middle ages.” A more predictable advocate was the governor of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, Jampa Pahtsok. “It is unimaginable to have a high growth rate without a railroad.” Among the four or five unscheduled meetings I had with Tibetans, most were looking forward to the economic benefits the line is expected to bring: 2.5m tonnes of cargo and 1m tourists and business people. However, monks and worshippers expressed their worries that the environment and traditional spiritualism of the Tibetan minority were under threat. The issues of two years ago are very much the issues of today. With the first train services now less than two years away, Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader is increasingly worried about its impact. “Some kind of cultural genocide is taking place,” the Dalai Lama said earlier this month. “In general, a railway link is very useful in order to develop, but not when politically motivated to bring about demographic change.” The Tibetan dilemma is increasingly shared by other countries as the world tries to come to terms with China’s rise. Everyone wants Beijing’s money and goods; no one wants its ideas. Economically, China’s expansion is a storming success, with 9% growth for each of the past 25 years, lifting hundreds of millions of peasants out of poverty, making a fortune for foreign manufacturers who exploit low-cost labour, pushing down supermarket prices across the globe, and boosting trade with other developing nations. Environmentally and spiritually, however, it is a disaster. China’s rivers are drying up, its cities are choked with pollution, the rural health-care system has collapsed and the cities are seeing record levels of suicide and stress. China is showing all the symptoms of modernity - only on a bigger scale and at a faster rate than the world has ever seen. Xining (2,275m) This summer, when I renewed my relationship with the railway across the roof of the world, my first stop was Xining, the first Chinese provincial capital that will be linked to Lhasa when the railway opens. This city is a garrison for the tens of thousands of troops and police needed to maintain order around this often troubled edge of the Chinese empire. Since the communists came to power in 1949, it has also served as a black hole, where the government buries its political and military secrets. Xining is the headquarters for the network of penal camps spread throughout the province, where millions of criminals, dissidents and political opponents of the leadership have been “re-educated through labour”. The Qinghai plateau’s remoteness has also made the town an ideal development and testing ground for the military. Among the few tourist sights is a memorial to the factory that made China’s first nuclear bomb. For soldiers, Xining is a hardship posting. It sits in a bleak valley 2km above sea level, an altitude at which the brain and body start to struggle. On several occasions, Chinese troops based here have been sent to put down unrest in Tibet or to skirmish with Indian troops over the disputed area of Sikkim. But this is a time of unprecedented peace and development. Twenty years ago, there were almost no hotels or restaurants. Now there are dozens catering to an increasing number of business travellers, visiting officials and foreign tourists en route to Lhasa. While the main beneficiaries among the 270,000 population seem to be Han officials and businessmen, extra income is trickling down to Hui and Sala muslim restaurants selling lamb kebabs and mianpian noodles, and to the peddlers of Tibetan trinkets and medicine. One of the beneficiaries of the boom is Buddhism. This was evident from the mix of materialism, spiritualism and political cheek at the Ta’er Si, one of the great Tibetan monasteries. Set in rolling green hills just south of Xining and famed as the home of living buddhas since the 16th century, it is attracting an ever-growing number of Han tourists. Their chatter and mobile phones disturb monks as they chant tantric scriptures (“During the peak season, there are almost as many tour guides as monks,” complained one acolyte), but, as with the railway, the linking of materialism and spiritualism is not a one-way track. Outside the monastery, the streets are filled with Buddhist wholesale shops (often run by Muslims) who offer bulk sales of robes, incense sticks, prayer wheels and beads. The customers are not tourists but monks, stocking up on paraphernalia to establish more monasteries. “This is a boom time for Buddhism in China,” says Glen Mullin, the author of several books on the Dalai Lama. “Many of the monasteries that were shut down and destroyed during the cultural revolution are being rebuilt, along with new ones.” The thrice-daily service west from Xining to Golmud is as close to the roof of the world as a passenger can get on China’s rail network. But when the new Qinghai-Tibet railway opens, this 800km-long line will be the penultimate leg on the 48-hour journey from Beijing to Lhasa. Luxury trains are being built for the new track. They feature pressurised carriages to minimise the risk of altitude sickness and tinted windows to protect from strong ultra-violet rays. Canada’s Bombardier has won the US$280m contract to build 361 cars, some of which will have deluxe sleeping compartments with individual showers, glass-walled sides to provide panoramic views, entertainment centres and gourmet dining areas, and toilets with sewage and waste-treatment systems. The cars will be pulled by diesel engines capable of maintaining an average speed of 100 kph, even at above 4,000m, when the thinness of the air can cut power by almost half. The new train will be a world away from the crowded, smelly, smoke-filled carriage we boarded at Xining. The passengers were on narrow beds that climbed in three-tiers almost all the way to the ceiling. There was no dining car, only trolleys selling instant noodles that could be served from giant steel flasks provided for each set of six beds. Golmud (2,800m) We arrive in Golmud just after dawn. My Lonely Planet guidebook warns of a “forlorn outpost in the oblivion end of China”. But that book was published five years ago. Today, development seems to be everywhere. Many of the roads and buildings look new, and there is a plethora of cranes and construction sites. The newest addition to this city of 200,000 people is a giant two-storey TV screen blaring out advertisements for cosmetics and electrical goods, such as would be seen in Tokyo, Seoul or Shanghai. The city has become more hospitable, too. There are four-star hotels that accept foreigners, along with neon-lit streets of restaurants, pink-lit “massage parlours” and gaudy karaoke bars. With a few hours to kill, we visit the closest thing the city has to a museum. It is the former home of General Mu Shengzhong, who oversaw the construction of the Golmud-to-Lhasa road in the early 1950s to consolidate China’s control over Tibet. When we arrive at the house, it is locked and all we can see through a window is a huge bust of General Mu in two otherwise empty rooms. More profitably, we spend time with Zha Xi, a burly Tibetan from the Wild Yak Brigade. This rag-tag patrol of two dozen men was formed to fight off poachers threatening endangered species. Having at least temporarily won the battle against the poachers, they are now turning their focus to the development of eco-tourism on the Qinghai Plateau. Over a bowl of noodles, Zha admits to mixed feelings about the rate of change in the area. “Overall, I think it is a good thing because this area is poor and isolated so people need more economic development. But it is bad for the environment. The railway is being built through the habitat of the Tibetan antelope. They are very timid animals and they have been scared off by the construction work.” Xidatan service station (4,350m) It is no longer possible to ride the train. We are now ahead of the operational tracks. Engines are ferrying equipment up and down the route and we have to be content with a jeep ride along General Mu’s bumpy highway. It is soon evident why so many people died during the construction of the road. Soon after leaving Golmud, we hit the start of the Kunlun range. The craggy slopes on either side are so steep and barren that it is like driving through an alien planet. This is where engineers started blasting and building the first of the seven tunnels and 286 bridges on the 1,110km-long stretch of new line. At its maximum altitude in the Tanggula pass, the track runs 5,072m above sea level - higher than western Europe’s greatest peak, Mont Blanc, and more than 200m higher than the Peruvian railway in the Andes, which was previously the world’s most elevated track. The longest tunnel - at Yangbajin - stretches 3.3km. The longest bridge spans 1.17km over the Qingsui river. Such awesome statistics are the scripture of China’s materialism, evidence of the powerful gospel of scientific development. So is the speed at which the track has been laid, three years ahead of the original seven-year schedule. For the disciples of the economic miracle, this is further proof of how China is overtaking the US to become the country of bigger, higher, faster. This ambition is apparent across the country, where Chinese engineers are building the world’s biggest dam, the longest bridge and the tallest building. Two years ago, China joined the US and Russia as the only countries to put a man in space. Another will go up next month, and in 2007, the country plans to launch its first moon probe. But the railway across the top of the world is arguably the greatest example of the achievements and risks of this can-do spirit. After driving for four hours, we stop to talk to some of the pioneers who have conquered the terrain at Xidatan, the first servicing station on the new line. Just completed, the small, brilliant-white building waits forlornly for passengers in the midst of a vast dirty grey plain of dust and stones. The nearest habitation is an exhaust-filled, rubbish-strewn strip of a dozen restaurants and a few petrol pumps. Perhaps the station’s function is strategic - the plain is also home to an encampment of hundreds of green PLA tents, trucks and artillery pieces. The station’s current residents, however, are railway engineers who are looking forward to leaving. With the work almost complete, they are in good spirits, but they have faced treacherous conditions over the past four years. When Zhao Jianjun arrived from his native Shaanxi province, he needed oxygen to breathe. Working mainly on viaducts, he helped to push the work forward at the rate of a kilometre of track a day. But for five months every winter, work became impossible in temperatures that fell to -30C. Even in the warmer seasons, there were often snowfalls or hailstorms. According to the Xinhua news agency and my patriotic friend Wang, no one has died of altitude sickness, but Zhao says the work has claimed several lives. It is something we hear on several occasions, though no one knows how many of the 38,000 workers on the project have perished from accidents or illness. Kunlun Pass (4,776m) From Xidatan, the railway climbs steadily towards Kunlun Pass. This is one of the great doorways to the top of the world. It is also the northern shore of a vast sea of permafrost that stretches more than 600km across the plateau towards Tibet and the Himalayas, prompting some to describe this area as the third pole of the world. This barrier of ice and rock had been considered impassable, but China’s scientists believe they have overcome the challenge. Their big technological breakthrough has been to insulate the track from the top level of ice, which thaws every summer day and freezes by night. On a normal line this would buckle the rails, collapse bridges and cave in tunnels. But for the new railway, engineers have pumped cooling agents into the ground so that the earth around the most vulnerable tunnels and pillars remains frozen and stable. It is not cheap. Largely because so much of the line has been built on viaducts rather than the semi-frozen surface, the budget for the railway is 26.2bn yuan (£1.8bn). But even this ingenious and expensive solution may not be enough to protect the track from the worst hazard affecting the plateau: global warming. If current trends continue, Chinese climatologists forecast a 3.4C rise over the next half century, which would lead to a shrinking of the ice by more than 30%. At the pass, we meet two Hui-minority railway construction workers who tell us the project is still bedevilled by the difficulty of securing firm foundations. “We have had to rebuild some of the stations because of permafrost damage,” say the labourers. “The construction bureau is now discussing how to solve the problem.” If true, this would challenge official boasts that the most important technical challenge of the railway has been overcome. I was unable to confirm what damage had occurred. But there is more evidence that the railway’s engineers are struggling to keep pace with the environmental damage wrought by global warming. Temperatures in Qinghai Plateau are rising twice as quickly as in the rest of China. Luo Yong, deputy director of the National Climate Centre, estimates that the volume of ice on either side of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway has retreated by 12% since the 1960s. “By 2050, the safe operation of the Qinghai-Tibet railway will be affected if temperatures keep rising steadily as observed over the past decades,” Luo warned at a recent symposium. To get a sense of the environmental changes, we take our 4x4 vehicle off the road to see one of the biggest glaciers on the route - the wall of ice wedged between two peaks near Dongdatan. It is a hard drive across broken rock and rivers, then a short climb to the foot of the glacier. The bright sun has me sweating. But this is nothing compared with the deep rivulets that the heat has cut into the ice. As we draw closer, each crease in the ice proves to be a torrent of gushing water that has been locked solid for hundreds - possibly thousands - of years. The glacier is retreating. There were signs of landslides too, both on the slopes and back on the road, where subsidence caused by melting foundations had brought down bridges and cracked and potted several stretches of the road. Global warming was not the only cause. Near Kunlun Pass is a monument marking the huge earthquake that struck the area four years ago. It measured 8.1 on the Richter scale - ripping a 7km crack through the earth. This railway is going to be even harder to maintain than it has been to build. Wudaoliang (4,500m) The climb to the glacier is beginning to take its toll. I should have known better. Throughout the journey, the effects of the altitude had become increasingly apparent. On day one, as soon we stepped off the plane in Xining, crisp packets burst and a bottle of suntan lotion splurged its contents into my bag. A few hours later, I could feel a faint muzziness behind the temples. The next day in Golmud, 700m higher, my pen started leaking over my notes. Even at Xidatan, I quickly ran out of breath even after a slow walk. But with the help of medicine - western Diamox and Chinese Hongjingtian - I convince myself I have mastered the elements, so I rush up the last 100m to the foot of the glacier. At more than 5,000m - where the air contains less than half of the oxygen at sea level - I realise it is a stupid thing to do. I am soon paying the price. Back in the car, my head starts pounding, then the nausea sets it. Two hours later in Wudaoliang, I am throwing up by the side of the road. I recover only after squeezing a bag of oxygen through a tube into my nostrils. Adding insult to injury, just as I am retching, several elderly Chinese tourists trundle by serenely on bicycles en route from Golmud to Lhasa. Slow and steady, they show the alpine terrain the respect it is due. But the fragile environment is also suffering. The further we progress alongside the track, the more obvious is the damage. The roof of the world is leaking. Overgrazing has stripped off its thin grassy cover and global warming has burned through its liquid insulation. Between the rail and the road are puddles and pools of melted permafrost. On either side, herds of cows and sheep munch on blotchy patches of grassland and man-made barriers attempt to keep the encroaching sand dunes at bay. Settlement and modernisation have brought the problem of non-degradable rubbish. Behind each cluster of buildings on the route - such as the small village-garrison of Wudaoliang - is a stinking pile of rotting bags, empty tins, plastic bottles and petrol cans. When I ask our driver how the refuse is disposed of, he laughs. “We leave that job to the wind and the rain and the dogs.” Half of this region belongs to China’s largest nature reserve. This is the dark and dirty side of China’s development. Pan Yue, the deputy minister of the environment, says the Qinghai Plateau and the western region of China are so ecologically stressed that they can no longer support their current populations. Because there is not enough space for them all to be resettled quickly, he estimates that the country will soon have more than 150 million environmental refugees. The problems are evident throughout the country. When the railway is finished, travellers on the train from Beijing to Lhasa will pass through some of the most polluted cities and over-exploited farmlands in the world. Acid rain now falls on a third of the Chinese landmass. According to the World Bank, 16 of the planet’s 20 worst polluted cities are in China. Tuotuohe (4,200m) Just downstream from that glacier, and far across an endlessly bleak plain, is our destination: the station at Tuotuohe, the biggest town between Golmud and the Tibetan border. It is the ultimate frontier community: a narrow strip of grubby buildings populated by a few hundred railway workers, soldiers, truck drivers and the providers of the services they seek - garages, restaurants, open-air pool tables, rough beds and a brothel. An endless stream of lorries roars through on the road that General Mu built. We stay overnight in a grimy truckers’ lodge. Over dinner at the Chengdu First Class Restaurant, I am too tired to even chat. We have reached the place where China’s can-do spirit pushes people and the environment to the limit. Just across the river, migrant labourers are rushing to finish the construction of a railway station. They are doing their part to achieve China’s engineering miracle, but there is no pride, only relief. “I’m too tired to feel glad,” says a welder from Xining who lives in a tent on the building site. “I have been here four months and I’m still not used to the altitude.” This is the end of the line for me. Ahead is another vast barren plain then the towering peaks of the Tanggula range, which mark the border with Tibet. The railway stretches forward, but I have seen its destination. It is time to head home. On the way back, the clouds - seemingly close enough to touch - break in a fury, and the storm makes the stony, blotchy plains darker, damper and bleaker. The landscape looks as exhausted as the workers. As the rain lashed down, I wondered who was to blame for the environmental disaster of the Qinghai Plateau. Certainly not only China. Global warming is a legacy of two centuries of industrial development in Europe, the US and Japan. But in doing the same thing on a bigger scale and at a faster speed, China has the capacity to make things much worse, much more quickly. If railway tracks can spread the tools of modern technology and education to Tibet, the lifestyles of some of the poorest people in the world could be dramatically improved. If ideas are allowed to flow freely in both directions along the track, the meeting of Chinese materialism and Tibetan spiritualism could fill a gap at both ends of the line. And if, as some suggest, the tracks are extended further south to the border with Nepal and then on through the Himalayas to India, it could transform relations between the world’s two most populous and fastest-growing economies. Present trends, however, suggest a much bleaker future. Fifty years ago, when Qinghai Plateau was part of Tibet, it was a scantly populated wilderness. Now, under Beijing’s control, it has become a land conquered and settled by Han engineers, miners, soldiers, police and prisoners. There are few grimmer examples of what Chinese-style development can mean for ethnic minorities and the environment. In the 19th century, Britain and Europe taught the world how to produce. In the 20th, the US taught us how to consume. If China is to lead the world in the 21st century, it must teach us how to sustain. China’s world-beating engineering projects Three Gorges dam The $24bn Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze river is the largest hydroelectric dam project in the world, and China’s biggest construction project since the Great Wall. It will span nearly a mile across and tower 185m above the world’s third-longest river. Its reservoir will stretch more than 350 miles and will force the displacement of between one and two million people. It is scheduled for completion by 2009. Shenzhou spacecraft China launched its first Shenzhou or “divine vessel” spacecraft on an unmanned flight in November 1999. Shenzhou V (October 2003) was the first manned flight, carrying Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei, making China the third country to send a human into space. The Shenzhou spacecraft, launched with Long March rockets, is modelled on the Russian’s Soyuz spacecraft. Oriental Pearl tower At 468m tall, Shanghai’s 10-year-old Oriental Pearl tower is the highest TV tower in Asia. The main structure is formed by three columns and a series of spheres, the largest 50m in diameter. With its revolving restaurant, hotel and observation decks, it attracts 3 million visitors a year. Lupu bridge, Shanghai With a main arch span of 550m, the Lupu bridge is the world’s longest steel-arch bridge. It spans the Huangpu river and connects the Shanghai north-south expressway between Pudong airport and the city centre. It took three years and cost 2.5bn yuan (£171m) to build. Terminal 3, Beijing airport British architect Norman Foster and British engineering company Arup are building the third terminal at Beijing airport, to be opened before the 2008 Olympics. The complex, funded mainly by the Chinese government, will be the world’s largest and is worth £1.2bn. The airport will handle up to 60 million passengers and 500,000 planes a year. Foster has described the scale as “truly awesome”. Beijing’s Olympic stadiums China’s ambitious plans for the Olympics (early estimates put spending between £17bn and £22bn) have been scaled down after rumours of corruption and concerns that extravagance would highlight the poverty of much of the country. However, 14 of the 36 Olympic venues are still being built from scratch. The main stadium, with a capacity of 91,000, is being built by Herzog &amp; De Meuron, the firm that designed Tate Modern.

        "title": "Rumsfeld flags concerns over China military SINGAPORE SPEECH: [USA 2ND EDITION]; Rumsfeld flags concerns over China military SINGAPORE SPEECH::   [USA 2ND EDITION ]",
        "original_text": "Donald Rumsfeld, the US defence secretary, is today expected to tell Asian defence ministers in Singapore that the US is concerned about China's military rise and lack of free expression. In prepared remarks to be delivered at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore, Mr Rumsfeld raises questions about the increasing growth in the Chinese military, and its projection of force in the world. \"Since no nation threatens China, one wonders: why this growing investment?\" he asks. The Pentagon is next week expected to release its annual report on the Chinese military, which will warn that the US should take more seriously the prospect that China might emerge as a strategic rival to the US. The report has been controversial within the administration, as National Security Council officials have objected to some language that appears to paint an overly antagonist picture. One person familiar with the report said it still contained \"pessimistic scenarios\" about China's military development. Mr Rumsfeld will signal today that the report concludes that China's defence expenditures are larger than Beijing has admitted. Mr Rumsfeld outlines various concerns about China's military build- up, particularly its increasing missile arsenal. \"China appears to be expanding its missile forces, allowing it to reach targets in many areas of the world while also expanding its missile capabilities within this region (Asia),\" Mr Rumsfeld says. \"China also is improving its ability to project power, and is developing advanced systems of military technology. One might be concerned that this build-up is putting the delicate military balance in the region at risk - especially, but not only, with respect to Taiwan.\" President George W. Bush in his campaign for president in 2000 called China a \"strategic competitor\" as opposed to a \"strategic partner\", which was the language preferred by his predecessor, Bill Clinton. Relations improved after the 2001 terror attacks on the US, as China co-operated in the \"war on terror\". But more recently the administration has sent signals of concern about China. In recent months, a string of US administration officials have raised concerns about China's military build-up. The White House has also criticised China for passing an anti-succession law, which would force the People's Liberation Army to attack Taiwan if it moves towards declaring independence. Chris Hill, the most senior State Department official on east Asia, recently urged China to put more pressure on North Korea to return to the negotiating table to resolve nuclear tensions on the Korean peninsula. Mr Rumsfeld reiterates that view in his speech. He is expected to voice concerns about political freedoms in China, which he says are not keeping pace with military spending and economic growth. \"With a system that encouraged enterprise and free expression, China would appear more as a friend and a welcome partner,\" he says. \"Ultimately, China will need to embrace some form of open, representative government if it is to fully achieve the benefits to which its people aspire.\"",
        "debiased_text": "Donald Rumsfeld, the US Defense Secretary, is scheduled to address Asian defense ministers in Singapore today at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. According to prepared remarks, he will discuss US observations regarding China's military expansion and its global force projection. Rumsfeld will note that, given the absence of threats to China, questions arise about the reasons behind its growing military investment. The Pentagon is preparing to release its annual report on China's military next week, which will assess China as a potential strategic competitor to the US. The report has reportedly prompted internal debate, with National Security Council officials expressing concerns about some of its language. An unnamed source indicated the report includes assessments of China's military development that some may view as pessimistic. Rumsfeld will note the report's conclusion that China's defense spending exceeds Beijing's official figures. He will highlight specific areas of China's military modernization, including the expansion of its missile capabilities, which allow for broader regional and global reach. The speech will also reference China's efforts to enhance its power projection and develop advanced military technologies. Rumsfeld will observe that these developments could affect regional military dynamics, particularly concerning Taiwan. The speech will contrast the current administration's description of China as a 'strategic competitor' with the previous administration's characterization of China as a 'strategic partner.' US-China relations saw improvement following cooperation after the 2001 terrorist attacks, but recent statements from US officials have expressed concerns about China's military activities. These include criticism of China's anti-secession law regarding Taiwan. Chris Hill, the State Department's senior official for East Asia, recently called for China to encourage North Korea to resume negotiations on nuclear issues. Rumsfeld will reiterate this position in his remarks. He will also address the relationship between China's economic growth and its political system, suggesting that greater openness could foster improved international relations."

        "original_text": "The US Treasury, in its twice-yearly report to Congress on exchange rates and trade, stopped short of accusing China of currency manipulation but put Beijing on notice that it expected a revaluation within six months. The report's conclusions risk an angry reaction from the US Congress, which has lost patience with the Treasury's gentle diplomacy on China's exchange rate and favours stronger measures. \"The fixed exchange rate that China now maintains is a substantial distortion to world markets, blocking the price mechanism and impeding the adjustment of international imbalances,\" the report said. The Treasury also sought to clarify that, while it has previously focused on the case for full currency flexibility in China, an immediate shift was now needed as an interim step towards a full float. Action would be welcomed by legislators and US manufacturers who have become increasingly concerned about the US's trade deficit with China. Administration officials have acknowledged alarm at a bill put forward in Congress by Charles Schumer, a Democrat senator, that would impose heavy sanctions if China did not revalue in six months. But many China experts have suggested that aggressive action by the US will only delay Beijing's avowed intention of changing its currency regime. The Treasury does not want to be seen to cave into protectionist pressures. Yesterday's report was couched in the language of global imbalances, rather than the bilateral US-China relationship, and the Group of Seven's call for international action to promote more balanced global growth. It stressed the benefits for China of allowing its currency to rise, as well as arguing that other Asian government's should follow the same course. But the report made clear that China would meet the ill-defined technical requirements that would cause it to be named a currency manipulator if there was no substantial change in its currency regime in the six month time-frame. \"Treasury will monitor progress on China's foreign exchange market developments very closely over the next six months in advance of preparation of the (autumn) report,\" it said. Singling out China would require the administration to enter into talks with Beijing over its currency peg. The Treasury pointed out it had already been involved in discussions with Beijing since 2003. The US has not accused a country of currency manipulation since China was last named in 1994. While the analysis presented yesterday focused on the second half of last year, China's current account surplus has continued to rise this year. The Treasury said that China's global current account surplus increased to Dollars 40bn (Euros 30.7bn, Pounds 21bn) in the second half of last year, or 4.2 per cent of gross domestic product. This is roughly twice as large as the surplus in the second half of 2003. China's accumulation of foreign exchange reserves also accelerated in the same period, it said, with official reserves increasing by Dollars 139bn to Dollars 610bn.",
        "debiased_text": "The US Treasury issued its biannual report to Congress on exchange rates and trade, noting concerns about China's currency practices without formally labeling it a currency manipulator. The report indicated expectations for a currency revaluation within six months. It stated that China's current exchange rate policy distorts global markets and hinders international economic adjustments. The Treasury emphasized the need for China to move toward greater currency flexibility as an intermediate step before a full float. The report mentioned that US legislators and manufacturers have expressed concerns about the trade deficit with China, referencing a proposed bill by Senator Charles Schumer that would impose sanctions if China does not revalue its currency within six months. Treasury officials noted they do not wish to appear influenced by protectionist pressures. The report framed the issue in terms of global economic imbalances rather than bilateral relations, aligning with G7 calls for policies to encourage balanced global growth. It highlighted potential benefits for China from currency adjustments and suggested other Asian countries consider similar measures. The Treasury stated it will monitor China's currency policies closely over the next six months ahead of its autumn report. Since 2003, the US has engaged in discussions with China about its currency system. No country has been formally accused of currency manipulation since China in 1994. The report included data showing China's current account surplus rose to $40 billion in the second half of last year, representing 4.2% of GDP, approximately double the surplus from the same period in 2003. China's foreign exchange reserves also grew by $139 billion to $610 billion during that time."

        "original_text": "Washington -- CHINA'S RISE is creating fissures among Republicans in Congress over how the U.S. should respond. The rifts mirror some within the Bush administration. But Chinese government officials seem more concerned these days with those in Congress, where passions about potential foreign rivals can sometimes force through harsher policies. The emerging blocs in Congress are divided between military hawks who portray Beijing as a potential strategic threat and the Chamber of Commerce camp, which tends to see the Asian giant as a great economic opportunity. Two different congressional groups were launched earlier this year to analyze and shape the policy debate over China's surging economic and political clout. The 31-member China Congressional Caucus, focusing on the People's Liberation Army's military modernization, is headed by Rep. J. Randy Forbes, a Virginia Republican. When discussing China, he mentions a scene from the movie \"Jaws,\" in which the police chief nonchalantly throws fish bait into waters off the New England coast. A great white shark lunges out of the water, terrifying the audience. \"That's kind of what China did to the world,\" says Mr. Forbes. Illinois Republican Rep. Mark Kirk heads the 35-member U.S.-China Study Group. He says his group's main goal is to \"reduce needless conflict with China based on wrong information.\" While the congressman says China's military upgrade is \"profound and it's worrying,\" he argues that U.S. trade and diplomatic ties will turn \"China into a less-menacing state.\" Healthy economic ties are also good for his district in Chicago, where three giant U.S. corporate players in China -- Boeing Co., Motorola Inc. and United Airlines parent UAL Corp. -- have their headquarters. The two factions clashed earlier this year over a House resolution opposing the bid by Chinese state oil company Cnooc Ltd. to buy U.S. oil producer Unocal Corp., a deal that failed in part because of congressional opposition. Mr. Forbes says he backed the measure, which passed by a 398-to-15 vote, because the Cnooc takeover could have threatened U.S. access to oil supplies. He also says it would have given the Chinese \"monitoring capabilities\" for U.S. military installations near drilling sites in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Kirk opposed the resolution, arguing that much criticism of the deal was based on inaccurate information. He says many legislators didn't realize that most of Unocal's oil and gas exploration activities were no longer based in the U.S. and that Beijing allowed American oil companies to invest in China. The differing approaches to China on Capitol Hill mirror similar strains developing within the Bush administration. Two weeks ago, Treasury Secretary John Snow visited China, praising the government for economic restructuring and playing down congressional criticism over Chinese currency policy. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld arrived in China for his own visit last week, after months in which the Pentagon has bluntly criticized China's military buildup as potentially destabilizing for Asia. While Mr. Rumsfeld's remarks in a speech in China were less critical, he still fretted about Beijing's rising military power, saying that it \"leads other nations to question China's intentions.\" But these days, Chinese government officials are watching the split in Congress to see which group dominates -- the one run by Rep. Forbes or the one championed by Rep. Kirk. Both men were elected to Congress in 2000. Mr. Forbes, 53 years old, was a lawyer in southeastern Virginia before entering politics. Mr. Kirk, 46, had a history in international relations, as a Naval Reserve intelligence officer, in posts at the World Bank and the State Department, and as an aide in the British House of Commons. Mr. Forbes tends to vote with the Republican Party's most conservative wing on economic, social and foreign-policy legislation, according to an analysis by the National Journal, a nonpartisan political magazine. Mr. Kirk, by the same study, splits his votes more evenly between conservatives and liberals. Mr. Kirk praises Mr. Forbes's efforts for helping to focus more attention on China. Mr. Forbes criticizes the Kirk caucus as \"cheerleaders\" who \"want more trade with China\" that ultimately could provide Beijing the income to build its military machine. Mr. Forbes, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, says in an interview that \"we still don't know if China will be our best friend or our worst enemy.\" Chinese officials say they need to modernize the military to block Taiwan -- which Beijing considers a breakaway province -- from declaring independence. But Mr. Forbes is convinced that China's recent purchases of diesel submarines and development of missiles are \"much bigger than Taiwan.\" He argues that the upgrading of China's military poses \"a huge threat\" and is \"all focused on the United States.\" While he doesn't have specific policies to propose at this point, Mr. Forbes urges the Bush administration to do a more thorough assessment of China's impact on the American \"military-industrial base\" and how it should respond to China during the next decade. He emphasizes the need for a long-term shipbuilding plan for the Navy to compete with China's active program. With a major shipbuilding center nearby, his district is home to many shipbuilding workers. Rep. Kirk, who first visited Beijing in 1984 as a congressional aide, says his group's main policy objective is to make U.S. relations with China the top diplomatic priority in Washington, as opposed to what he considers the current overemphasis on relations with Europe. \"The two largest economies on earth should place the highest priorities on relations to each other,\" he says. His group -- whose co-chairman is Washington State Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen -- supports increasing the resources available to the State Department to bolster the number of Chinese-language speakers in the foreign service, upgrade the U.S. Embassy's Web site in Beijing to cater to the \"Internet addiction\" of Chinese under the age of 40, and set up consulates in all Chinese cities with a population of more than 10 million. China appears to appreciate the friendly outlook of Mr. Kirk's caucus. China's new ambassador to Washington, Zhou Wenzhong, has coffee regularly with the group. Its members were slated to have a 90- minute meeting in September with Chinese President Hu Jintao, before his visit to Washington was postponed after Hurricane Katrina. Mr. Forbes hasn't yet met with Mr. Zhou. Two attempts were canceled because of scheduling conflicts. His group wasn't offered a meeting with Mr. Hu. --- Two Perspectives on China",
        "debiased_text": "Washington — Differences among Republicans in Congress regarding the U.S. response to China's growing influence reflect similar divisions within the Bush administration. Chinese officials are reportedly paying closer attention to congressional debates, where differing views on foreign policy can lead to stricter measures. Two congressional groups formed earlier this year to examine China's increasing economic and political influence. The 31-member China Congressional Caucus, led by Rep. J. Randy Forbes (R-Va.), focuses on China's military modernization. Separately, the 35-member U.S.-China Study Group, chaired by Rep. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), aims to reduce unnecessary conflicts with China based on misinformation. The two groups disagreed earlier this year over a House resolution opposing Chinese state oil company Cnooc Ltd.'s bid for U.S. oil producer Unocal Corp., which ultimately failed. Forbes supported the resolution, citing concerns over U.S. oil supply access and potential monitoring of military sites. Kirk opposed it, arguing that much of the criticism was based on inaccurate details, noting Unocal's overseas operations and U.S. oil investments in China. Similar divisions exist within the Bush administration, with Treasury Secretary John Snow recently praising China's economic reforms, while Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has expressed concerns about China's military expansion. Both Forbes and Kirk were elected to Congress in 2000. Forbes, a former lawyer, aligns with conservative policy positions, while Kirk, with a background in international relations, votes more variably. Kirk’s group advocates for strengthening U.S.-China ties, proposing expanded diplomatic resources for Chinese-language training and upgraded embassy services. Forbes, meanwhile, emphasizes assessing China’s military impact and ensuring long-term U.S. naval competitiveness. Kirk’s group has engaged with Chinese officials, including meetings with Ambassador Zhou Wenzhong, while Forbes's scheduling conflicts have delayed such interactions."

        "original_text": "pgoodspeed@nationalpost.com\nLien Chan's historic Chinese visit could lead to new relations or a catastrophe\nCondemned by some in Taiwan as a traitor, Lien Chan, chairman of the Kuomintang, Taiwan's leading opposition party, was greeted on the Chinese mainland yesterday with flowers, warm speeches and cheering crowds.\nAt the start of a historic eight-day visit to China, Mr. Lien sought to end a vicious, nearly six-decade-old standoff that periodically threatens to erupt into war with a low-key call for a united China.\nThe 69-year-old former Taiwanese vice-president and foreign minister dined with local Communist leaders, toured the ornate mausoleum of Kuomintang founder Sun Yat Sen in Nanjing and talked to reporters about the need for \"peaceful perseverance\" in improving relations with China.\nAfter visiting Shanghai today, Mr. Lien will travel to Beijing, where he will meet tomorrow with China's President, Hu Jintao.\nThat encounter will mark the first time a Kuomintang leader has held peace talks with Chinese Communist Party leaders since Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek met in the city of Chongqing in August, 1945, in a bid to negotiate an end to China's civil war.\nThe last time a leader of the Kuomintang set foot on mainland China, the Chinese Nationalists had just lost the war to the Communists and Chiang Kai-shek's army had fled to Taiwan.\nIn the long standoff that followed, China laid claim to Taiwan, regarding it as a \"renegade province.\" The government in Taiwan continued to claim the right to rule China.\nFor years, the Kuomintang jailed people considered sympathetic to the Chinese Communists, and until the late 1980s they declared it illegal for any Taiwanese to visit the mainland.\nNow, with a democratically elected government in Taipei that has hinted it wants to move toward independence, the Kuomintang, which has been out of power since 2000, suddenly finds itself thrust into the role of peacemaker.\nA month after China passed a controversial anti-secession law that laid the legal groundwork for invading Taiwan should the island's 23 million people ever seek to secede, Mr. Lien and his party are trying to ease tensions.\nAt Sun Yat Sen's mausoleum in Nanjing yesterday, where several hundred older Chinese rallied to meet Mr. Lien, he told reporters: \"In his dying days, Mr. Sun Yat Sen repeatedly called for the Chinese people not to forget peace, to strive for and to save China.\"\n\"We must remember Dr. Sun's nation-building spirit in overcoming our cross-strait impasse,\" he added. \"Let us all work together to secure cross-strait peace, to build a better future for all Chinese in the 21st century.\"\nSun Yat Sen was a revolutionary leader who served as China's president after the fall of the Manchu dynasty in 1911. He died in 1925.\nMr. Lien's homecoming may mark a turning point in China's relations with Taiwan -- or it could, indirectly, hasten a cataclysmic confrontation by spurring Taiwanese nationalists to push even harder for independence.\nIt has already served to polarize politics in Taiwan.\nBefore he left, the Taiwanese government threatened to charge Mr. Lien with treason if he dared to sign any sort of deal with China's leaders.\nYesterday, while speaking to a business group, Taiwan's President, Chen Shui-bian, accused Mr. Lien of recklessly endangering Taiwan.\n\"Some people have expressed concern to me in private that they are worried that there are some people within the opposition parties who are using cross-strait exchanges as chips in their political rivalry and who want to isolate and attack the government and allow the other side of the [Taiwan] Strait to divide us,\" he said.\n\"Such an anxiety is understandable,\" he added.\nColumnist Chin Heng-wei, writing in Taiwan's Taipei Times, was not so diplomatic. \"The treasonous behaviour of Lien and [James] Soong [leader of the opposition People's First Party, who travels to China on May 5] will force the people of Taiwan to take sides,\" he declared.\n\"If Lien and Soong take the bait that China offers, Taiwan will face a clear and present danger. How can the people of Taiwan stand by and do nothing? The time has come 'to resist the invader and root out traitors,' \" he concluded.\nChina, for its part, is portraying Mr. Lien's visit as a possible step toward reunification.\n\"The historic visit will undoubtedly deepen the love among compatriots across the straits, enhance mutual understanding and prompt the Taiwanese public to have more cool-minded thinking about cross-straits ties and Taiwan's future,\" the China Daily newspaper declared.\nApart from giving China a chance to play good cop/bad cop on the issue of Taiwanese independence, Mr. Lien's visit may provide a crucial new opening for direct talks between Taiwan and the mainland.\nShould Mr. Lien, who lost presidential elections in 2000 and 2004, ever return the Kuomintang to power, his talks this week with China's top leaders could pave the way to a breakthrough in one of Asia's most contentious conflicts.",
        "debiased_text": "Lien Chan, chairman of Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang party, began an eight-day visit to China yesterday. The trip marks the first time a Kuomintang leader has visited mainland China since the party's relocation to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the civil war to the Communists. During his visit, Lien met with local Communist officials, visited Sun Yat Sen's mausoleum in Nanjing, and is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao in Beijing tomorrow. This will be the first meeting between Kuomintang and Communist Party leaders since 1945. Lien emphasized the need for 'peaceful perseverance' in cross-strait relations during his public statements. The visit comes one month after China passed its anti-secession law regarding Taiwan. Taiwan's government has warned against any agreements being signed during the visit, with President Chen Shui-bian expressing concerns about opposition parties using cross-strait exchanges for political purposes. The trip has generated mixed reactions in Taiwan, with some commentators expressing strong opposition while others see potential for improved relations. Chinese media described the visit as potentially improving mutual understanding between the two sides. Lien's visit represents a significant development in cross-strait relations, though its long-term impact remains uncertain."

        "original_text": "The new port of Gwadar will be unveiled April 6 as the \"Dubai of Pakistan,\" even if it lacks the theme-park glitz of the Gulf's fantasy city. The point, say Chinese officials, who bankrolled 80 percent of the $248 million project, is that this new deepwater cargo port is \"strictly commercial.\" But hawks in Washington and New Delhi believe Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has given Beijing the nod to use Gwadar as a port of call for the Chinese Navy. \"Gwadar's a strategic location, just 400 kilometers from the Strait of Hormuz,\" says William Triplett III, a Washington-based conservative analyst who warns Gwadar will become a Chinese naval base \"on little cat feet.\" Alarm bells are ringing in Washington, where some see a pattern in Beijing's naval build-up, combined with a foreign-port building spree and efforts to secure maritime oil-transport routes. An internal report circulated among Pentagon officials late last year says Beijing is assembling a \"string of pearls\"--including ports, listening posts and naval agreements from Pakistan to Bangladesh to Burma--to protect its fragile oil-supply routes. Gwadar is critical, because it would provide the Chinese a listening post for monitoring ship traffic to and from the oil-rich Middle East, according to the report, which asserts that China is building up naval power at maritime \"chokepoints... to deter the potential disruption of energy supplies from potential threats, including the U.S. Navy.\" China's naval outreach program is of concern to New Delhi, too, and was an underlying theme during U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's visit to India last week. Until a few years ago, China's hunt for energy resources was confined largely to the economic sphere, spearheaded by its state- owned oil and gas firms. But Chinese officials came to see U.S.-led conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq as wars over oil, just as its own oil demands were booming. Two years ago China surpassed Japan as the world's second biggest oil importer, after the United States. Now crude-oil prices are hitting record highs, topping $57 a barrel last week, amid warnings from strategists of a coming \"energy cold war.\" What began as a commercial rivalry for oil supplies engaging the United States, Japan and China now seems poised \"to spill over into the political and military spheres,\" according to Chietigj Bajpaee, a researcher for Civic Exchange, a Hong Kong think tank. In the event of conflict over Taiwan, say mainland strategists, Beijing should expect the United States to try to starve China of oil with a naval blockade. China is now lavishing funds on its Navy, long a neglected arm of the military services. Since George W. Bush took office, China has been building up its fleet of amphibious assault ships and submarines, and last December launched its first in a new class of nuclear subs, years earlier than anticipated by U.S. intelligence. In November, Japan chased a Chinese sub out of its territorial waters, near a disputed and gas-rich area of the East China Sea. Almost as soon as Beijing apologized for that incident, a Chinese research vessel intruded into Japanese waters, apparently surveying the seabed for oil and gas deposits. Meanwhile, India has pursued closer military contacts with the United States, and last year issued a new naval doctrine stressing the need to protect energy routes and respond to Beijing's inroads in the Arabian Sea. Ziad Haider, an analyst at the Henry L. Stimson Center think tank in Washington, says the port at Gwadar could monitor U.S. naval activity in the Gulf, Indian naval activity in the Arabian Sea and future U.S.-Indian maritime cooperation in the Indian Ocean. Gwadar may not be a full-fledged Chinese naval base, says Haider, \"but it could facilitate a [Chinese] naval presence.\" China also helped build the Chittagong port in Bangladesh where, says the Pentagon report, Beijing is \"seeking much more extensive naval and commercial access.\" Beijing is even discussing a deal with Phnom Penh that would provide Chinese patrol boats and naval training to Cambodia. The Pentagon report puts far more stress on the billions of dollars in military aid China has provided the junta in Myanmar \"to support a de facto military alliance.\" China has helped build several ports, road and rail links from the Chinese province of Yunnan to the Bay of Bengal, and a listening post on Myanmar's Coco Islands to monitor sea traffic.",
        "debiased_text": "The new port of Gwadar is scheduled to open on April 6. Chinese officials, who funded 80% of the $248 million project, describe it as a strictly commercial deepwater cargo port. Some analysts in Washington and New Delhi speculate that the port could potentially be used by the Chinese Navy, given its strategic location approximately 400 kilometers from the Strait of Hormuz. A report circulated among Pentagon officials last year suggested that China is developing maritime infrastructure, including ports and listening posts from Pakistan to Burma, to secure oil-supply routes. The report indicates that Gwadar could serve as a monitoring point for Middle Eastern ship traffic. China’s naval expansion and infrastructure projects have drawn attention from other countries, including India, where discussions during U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice’s recent visit touched on regional security. China has increased its naval capabilities in recent years, including the construction of amphibious assault ships and submarines. In November, a Chinese submarine entered Japanese territorial waters near a disputed area of the East China Sea, leading to diplomatic exchanges. Separately, India has strengthened military ties with the U.S. and updated its naval doctrine to address energy route security. Analysts note that Gwadar could provide China with visibility into U.S. and Indian naval activities in the region. China has also invested in ports in Bangladesh and Cambodia, with discussions underway about further naval cooperation. According to the Pentagon report, China has provided military aid to Myanmar, supporting infrastructure projects such as road and rail links and establishing listening posts."

        "original_text": "The voracious appetite of giant pandas, which were presented as a gift to the nation by China, posed an awkward financial problem for the incoming Labour government. Ted Heath, the defeated Conservative prime minister, had triumphantly negotiated the despatch of Ching-Ching and Chia-Chia to London Zoo to mark the thawing of diplomatic relations with the communist regime. \"Pandas eat a lot,\" a translated message about the animals - sent in July 1974 from the UK embassy in Beijing - warned, \"with bamboo as their main food. A fully grown panda eats 15-20 kilos of bamboo a day. Their eating method is very much like humans eating sugar cane ...They sit on the ground, using their forward paws to to get hold of the bamboo and peeling it off.\" Behind the scenes, the Zoological Society of London complained repeatedly about the cost of flying the rare animals to Britain and tried to persuade British Airways to deliver them free of charge. It also suggested the Foreign Office should pay the airfare. Despite the fanfare of publicity greeting their arrival, the zoo was becoming increasingly desperate. Robert Armstrong, later to become cabinet secretary, noted in November: \"When Lord Zuckerman [from the zoo] came to see the prime minister, he said that being the agent for demonstrations of friendship between the British and Chinese governments was proving to be a pretty expensive business. \"It was not just that they had to maintain a suitable diet - consisting to a large extent of imported bamboo shoots - for the newly arrived pandas, but they also had to provide a pair of white rhinos to send back to China.\" The Foreign Office characterised the zoo's demands as ingratitude: \"In the first two weeks after pandas' arrival attendance at the zoo was up 60% on last year; pre pandas it was down 30%... All in all, we think the zoo has done very well.\" Realising that the launch of a public appeal to feed the pandas would antagonise the Chinese, the problem was sent to the Department of the Environment, which was encouraged to find extra funds to feed the hungry animals.",
        "debiased_text": "The dietary needs of giant pandas, which were gifted to the UK by China, presented a financial challenge for the incoming Labour government. The previous Conservative administration, led by Ted Heath, had arranged for Ching-Ching and Chia-Chia to be sent to London Zoo as part of diplomatic relations with China. A 1974 communication from the UK embassy in Beijing noted that adult pandas consume 15-20 kilograms of bamboo daily, which they process similarly to how humans eat sugarcane. The Zoological Society of London raised concerns about transportation costs and sought assistance from British Airways and the Foreign Office. Following the pandas' arrival, zoo attendance initially increased by 60% compared to the previous year, after having been 30% lower prior to their arrival. The zoo faced additional costs for maintaining the pandas' diet, which included imported bamboo, and for providing white rhinos to send to China. The Foreign Office noted the zoo's increased attendance and viewed their requests for support unfavorably. The Department of the Environment was asked to address the funding needs for the pandas' care."

        "original_text": "\"If you owe your bank a hundred pounds, you have a problem. But if you owe a million, it has.\" John Maynard Keynes If Keynes was right, the world's creditor countries have a huge problem and the US none at all. Yet the assumption that the creditors should be more terrified than the debtor is wrong if the latter needs to continue borrowing. If creditors face an endless stream of additional borrowing and a good chance of default at the end of it, they should refuse to throw good money after bad. They will then impose huge costs on the debtor. This balance of financial terror, as it has been called, characterises the current huge flows of finance to the US. Carefully thought through economic policy is needed if the world is to extricate itself from this predicament. Alas, we can rely on the administration of George W. Bush not to provide it. So it proved at this weekend's meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. The communique remarked that \"we emphasise that more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major countries and areas that lack such flexibility\". If anyone was in doubt about what that meant, John Snow, the US treasury secretary, insisted that China should embrace a looser exchange rate immediately. Mr Snow is not the organ-grinder of US economic policy but the monkey. But he accurately reflected the \"China-bashing\" now sweeping across US politics, so painfully reminiscent of the Japan- bashing of past decades. As Nouriel Roubini of New York University promptly responded, the US attack on one of its principal creditors is playing with fire. In the past two years, he argues, three quarters of the US fiscal deficit has been financed by foreign central banks, 100 per cent of the fiscal deficit has been financed from abroad and about 80 per cent of the current account deficit has been financed by foreign central banks.* Biting the hand that feeds one is folly. According to the International Monetary Fund, the US general government fiscal deficit this year will be 4.4 per cent of gross domestic product, while the current account deficit is forecast to be 5.8 per cent of GDP. At present, therefore, the American people are able to consume and invest as if the fiscal deficits did not exist. The treasury secretary of what is arguably the most fiscally irresponsible US administration since the second world war should fall down on his knees in thanks rather than indulge in complaints. Prof Roubini is also right to note the economic disruption that would ensue if the flow of official international credit were cut off. The consequences would almost certainly include a dollar collapse, higher domestic prices, a jump in interest rates, a fall in prices of housing, a steep rise in household bankruptcies and, not least, a sharp US recession. The bigger and swifter the adjustment in the external accounts, the more drastic those impacts would be. The landing would be hard. Nevertheless, it is in US long-run interests to avoid an explosive build-up of net external liabilities. However big the crisis if a sudden correction were to occur now, it would be nothing compared with what would happen after another decade of rising net liabilities. Better still, instead of choosing between a sudden correction now and a still more brutal sudden correction later, why not go for a smoother correction that starts now? The requirements for such a correction are clear. There needs to be a reduction of spending, in relation to potential output, in the US and an increase in spending in its creditors. A reduction in the US structural fiscal deficit will be required. Exchange rate movement will be needed as well, to facilitate adjustment. Where then does China fit into this? The answer is suggested by the charts, which show the current and capital accounts of all emerging market economies, of Asian emerging economies and of China itself since 1996, the year before the devastating Asian financial crisis. From these, one can draw four important conclusions. First, in 2004, the emerging market economies ran an aggregate current account surplus of Dollars 336bn (Pounds 175bn), just over half of the counterpart of the US deficit of Dollars 666bn. Asian emerging market economies ran a surplus of Dollars 193bn. Second, these current surpluses emerged after the financial crises. This is particularly visible for Asian emerging countries, which ran a current account deficit of Dollars 40bn in 1996 and a surplus of Dollars 114bn in 1998. Third, the private sector has been trying to push emerging market economies into current account deficit. In 2004, the combination of current account surpluses and net capital inflows forced emerging market economies to accumulate Dollars 519bn in reserves. The corresponding figure for Asian emerging economies was Dollars 344bn. Fourth, China is a significant player. Its current account surplus was 18 per cent of the emerging market total in 2004, its net inward direct investment was 28 per cent and its reserve accumulation was 40 per cent. In short, it will be impossible to achieve a significant adjustment of the US current account deficit without a big adjustment by emerging market economies. These are the world's natural deficit countries. Moreover, given present levels of reserves, running current account deficits at least equal to the inflow of FDI is both perfectly safe and obviously sensible. If the emerging market economies had run such current account deficits last year, the total would have been Dollars 186bn. The difference between the actual surplus and this deficit would have been Dollars 523bn, sufficient to eliminate most of the US deficit. Even China on its own is significant. Last year, the sum of its current account surplus and net inflow of FDI was 7 per cent of GDP. If it had run a current account deficit equal to inward FDI, instead, it would have run a deficit of Dollars 52bn. This would have made a difference of Dollars 111bn. The huge reserve accumulations of emerging market economies are by now senseless. These are not only wasteful investments but also prevent the global adjustment that the private sector rightly wishes to make. Emerging market economies should run current account deficits equal to inward FDI. Hectoring China on the exchange rate alone is folly. But a serious discussion of policies to deliver a better global balance is not. That discussion must begin now. * Global Economics Blog, April 17 2005, www.rgemonitor.com martin.wolf@ft.com",
        "debiased_text": "John Maynard Keynes once noted that the dynamics of debt differ based on the scale of borrowing. Currently, large financial flows to the U.S. reflect a balance where creditor nations continue to fund its deficits. At the recent Group of Seven meeting, the communique stated that greater exchange rate flexibility is desirable for major economies lacking it. U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow emphasized that China should adopt a more flexible exchange rate promptly. This stance aligns with broader U.S. political discussions regarding China’s economic policies. Nouriel Roubini of New York University observed that the U.S. relies heavily on foreign central banks to finance its fiscal and current account deficits, with approximately 75% of the fiscal deficit and 80% of the current account deficit funded externally. The International Monetary Fund projects the U.S. general government fiscal deficit at 4.4% of GDP and the current account deficit at 5.8% of GDP for the year. A sudden halt in foreign credit could lead to a dollar decline, higher domestic prices, increased interest rates, falling housing prices, and a potential recession. A gradual adjustment to reduce the U.S. fiscal deficit and increase spending in creditor nations, alongside exchange rate movements, could mitigate risks. Emerging market economies, including China, play a significant role in global imbalances. In 2004, these economies collectively recorded a $336 billion current account surplus, offsetting part of the U.S. deficit. China accounted for 18% of this surplus, 28% of net inward direct investment, and 40% of reserve accumulation among emerging markets. Reducing reserve accumulations and aligning current account deficits with foreign direct investment inflows could help rebalance global finances. Addressing these issues requires coordinated policy discussions rather than isolated focus on exchange rates."

        "title": "Chirac savaged over failed summit",
        "original_text": "Jacques Chirac, who has always fancied himself as a successor to Charles De Gaulle, must have thought he would be in for a hero's welcome when he returned to Paris to lead the weekend celebrations of the general's historic call to arms in 1940. Swollen with Gallic pride after denouncing Tony Blair's \"pathetic\" performance at the European summit, the president probably wondered whether the Champs Elysées would be full of adoring crowds. As he awoke to a summer heatwave on Saturday morning, after a dawn flight from Brussels, Mr Chirac was instead greeted with headlines depicting him as the principal loser of the summit. Le Monde, the grand old tribune of France's intelligentsia, declared the summit a \"double victory\" for Tony Blair. Downing Street officials could barely believe their luck as they read that Britain had buried the EU constitution and succeeded in highlighting the \"anomaly\" of how the EU spends seven times more on farmers than it does on \"future\" projects, such as science and research. \"This new failure on Europe risks affecting his credibility in the world arena and having the ricochet effect of further weakening him on the domestic scene,\" Le Monde said. Such powerful language shows how profoundly Europe has been shaken by the double blow over the past month of the rejection of the EU constitution and the failure by leaders to agree a new budget. The days when the French elite would automatically rally behind their president in a row with a British prime minister have ended as the establishment ponders the emphatic no in the referendum. The debate in France was watched very carefully in Chequers yesterday by the prime minister, who takes great pride in the French he learned as a student barman in Paris. As he reflected on the speech he will give to the European parliament on Thursday, Mr Blair let it be known to aides that he feels reinforced in his view that the events of the past month have given Europe a great opportunity. The new Blair philosophy says that Europe's leaders - though not the current crop in France and Germany - will eventually have to face up to the double rejection of the constitution by French and Dutch voters. On one side sits what he regards as the \"do nothing\" option exemplified most perfectly by Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister of Luxembourg, who interpreted the double no votes as a stunning endorsement of the old vision of Europe. On the other side stands Mr Blair and the next generation of European leaders - most notably Angela Merkel in Germany - who believe that Europe must reform. This wing appears to have woken up to the British argument that it is absurd to spend such a high proportion of the EU budget on farmers, who account for five per cent of the workforce, at a time when China and India are presenting such a high-tech challenge. Jack Straw, whose instinctive euroscepticism irritates the prime minister, found himself on the same wavelength as Mr Blair yesterday as he outlined the British thinking. \"Crises can either turn into disasters if you do nothing about them or they can turn into cathartic opportunities and I believe that we both have a duty and an opportunity here to turn it into a catharsis from which greater good comes,\" he said. While ministers are trying to remain upbeat, they know there will be deep perils ahead when they assume the EU presidency on July 1. The spectacle of a bitter public spat between two leaders will damage attempts to sell Europe and no doubt enrage an already enfeebled Mr Chirac who may be unhelpful during the G8 summit at Gleneagles. Sir Stephen Wall, the prime minister's former European adviser, told Sky News that Mr Chirac might lash out. \"He is that kind of politician. He is a tremendous bully-boy when he wants to be. \"But it would be very foolish if he were to do that [at Gleneagles] because on the main issues that the G8 are going to address the two countries that have most in common are France and Britain.\" Since the arrival of 10 new countries last year, most of whom count as members of \"New\" Europe, the balance of power has shifted away the Franco-German axis. But leaders in Poland, Hungary and Slovakia are spitting blood because the failure of the budget threatens vital projects in their countries. The prime minister, who had proposed exempting them from funding the British rebate, will have his work cut out to keep them on board. What happens next? Today Tony Blair reports back to MPs on the breakdown on the European summit. Michael Howard will criticise the prime minister for failing to use the summit to begin rebuilding the EU in Britain's image after the rejection of the constitution Thursday Prime minister travels to Brussels to spell out plans for Britain's six-month presidency, which begins on July 1. May receive a rough ride from MEPs, most of whom are opposed to the British rebate and regard the prime minister as a Margaret Thatcher figure July 1 Britain assumes the presidency of the EU. Optimists on the British side say the UK can fix the EU budget during this period because a budget was agreed upon during the British presidency of 1992, which started after the bruising battles of the Maastricht treaty negotiations. But Mr Blair may struggle to press ahead with his Lisbon economic reform plan September 18 Expected date of the German general election, a date which has been entered in bold ink in the Downing Street diary. A victory for the centre-right candidate, Angela Merkel, over Gerhard Schröder could spell the beginning of the end of the old order in Europe - or so No 10 hopes December 15-16 End-of-presidency summit when the prime minister will find out if he has succeeded in making progress on the \"three pillars\" of the presidency: prosperity, which means economic reform; security, which means tackling terrorism and drug trafficking; and values, which means help for the developing world January 1 2006 Austrians take over the presidency and will probably be landed with budget negotiations",

Following the European summit, headlines depicted Chirac as the principal summit loser. Le Monde described the summit as a \"double victory\" for Tony Blair. British officials noted the EU constitution was shelved and that EU spending was highlighted as disproportionately favoring agriculture over science and research. Le Monde suggested this outcome could impact Chirac's international credibility and domestic standing. The summit's budget disagreements and prior rejection of the EU constitution have prompted debates about Europe's direction. Tony Blair viewed recent events as an opportunity for EU reform, contrasting with some leaders who advocate maintaining the status quo. Discussions highlighted divisions on EU budget allocations, particularly agriculture spending amid global economic shifts. Jack Straw emphasized that crises may present reform opportunities. The UK will assume the EU presidency on July 1 amid challenges, including budget negotiations and tensions between member states. Some Central European leaders expressed discontent over stalled budget plans affecting their countries. Tony Blair will address MPs regarding the summit and outline the UK's presidency priorities, which face resistance from some MEPs. The UK presidency will focus on economic reform, security, and development. Future events include Germany's election and Austria assuming the presidency in January 2006."

        "original_text": "With MPs last week debating whether the government's new anti-terrorism bill, and its clause about outlawing the \"glorification\" of terrorism, would mean that their teenage Che Guevera T-shirts could get them banged up (presuming they could still fit into them), it will come as a reassurance that the prime minister today declared it was OK to wear a Free Tibet T-shirt in the Mall on Wednesday, when the Chinese president Hu Jintao arrives on a state visit. When Mr Hu's predecessor, Jian Zemin, visited London in October 1999, a diplomatic row ensued after several protesters complained that their pro-Tibet banners were seized by police before they had even unveiled them. Two protesters carrying Tibetan flags were seized by police when they mounted the barricade, albeit before President Zemin's convoy passed by. The then home office minister, Paul Boateng, denied rumours the government had put pressure on the Met to clamp down on peaceful protests highlighting China's human rights record, but, in the high court six months later, the Met was forced to apologise for pre-emptively removing pro-democracy placards and for positioning police vans where they may have blocked the president's sight of protesters. Quizzed today by the London Evening Standard as to whether there would be a repeat of such forceful policing, the PM was categorical: \"People are perfectly entitled to wear Free Tibet T-shirts or anything else. \"We live in a free, democratic country ... Of course people are perfectly free to say whatever they want to say.\" But he seemed less than eager to press Mr Hu on China's human rights record himself. Asked what topics may come up in the two men's meeting, Mr Blair said: \"We will discuss the economic relations between our two countries, which are growing. We will discuss, of course, the current security preoccupations in the world and how we cooperate better on the security council. \"We will discuss issues to do with climate change, where the Chinese have taken part very constructively in the G8-plus-five dialogue last week. It will give me an opportunity to hear from the president as to how economic and political development is progressing in China.\" Of course, the late Robin Cook declared in his autobiography, Point of Departure, that Mr Blair never did bring up human rights with the Chinese. Perhaps the biggest snub the late Mr Zemin faced was the absence from the state dinner of Prince Charles, who pleaded a prior engagement.",
        "debiased_text": "Last week, MPs debated the potential implications of the government's new anti-terrorism bill, including a clause prohibiting the 'glorification' of terrorism. Questions were raised about whether wearing Che Guevara T-shirts could lead to legal consequences. Separately, the prime minister stated that wearing Free Tibet T-shirts during Chinese President Hu Jintao's state visit on Wednesday would be permissible. During a previous state visit by Hu's predecessor, Jiang Zemin, in October 1999, protests occurred, with reports of pro-Tibet banners being confiscated by police before being displayed. Two protesters carrying Tibetan flags were detained after climbing a barricade, though this occurred before President Jiang's convoy arrived. At the time, then Home Office minister Paul Boateng denied allegations that the government pressured the Metropolitan Police to suppress protests related to China's human rights record. Six months later, the Met issued an apology in court for prematurely removing pro-democracy signs and positioning police vans where they might have obstructed the president's view of protesters. When questioned by the London Evening Standard about whether similar police actions might occur during Hu Jintao's visit, the prime minister stated that individuals have the right to wear Free Tibet T-shirts or express their views, emphasizing the country's democratic principles. Regarding potential discussion topics with President Hu, the prime minister mentioned economic relations, global security concerns, cooperation at the UN Security Council, and climate change. He also expressed interest in hearing about China's economic and political developments. Notably, the late Robin Cook wrote in his autobiography that the prime minister did not raise human rights issues during past discussions with Chinese leaders. During Jiang Zemin's visit, Prince Charles did not attend the state dinner, citing a prior engagement."

        "title": "Inco Makes Wager on Future; Demand, Prices for Nickel Expected to Get a Boost From China; Inco Makes Wager on Future; Demand, Prices for Nickel Expected to Get a Boost From China",
        "original_text": "AS GLOBAL MINING giants seek deals among flush nickel producers, Canada's Inco Ltd. is making a multibillion-dollar bet that the good times will last. This week, Swiss mining giant Xstrata PLC struck a $1.7 billion deal to acquire about 20% of Canada's Falconbridge Ltd., the world's third- largest nickel producer. Falconbridge itself had recently been swallowed by venerable Canadian base-metals producer Noranda Inc., which assumed the Falconbridge name. Xstrata had been rumored to be interested in Falconbridge's crosstown rival, Toronto-based Inco, the world's second-largest nickel miner in terms of production. The Xstrata deal with Falconbridge has left the industry wondering if Inco, for years rumored to be a takeover target, will hook up with another major mining company. Inco said it is happy to go it alone. \"A lot of people think bigger is better, but there's another way to the promised land,\" said Inco Chairman and Chief Executive Scott Hand. He insists high nickel prices will allow Inco to complete two major new nickel mines that will sharply increase the company's production and cash flow. Mr. Hand declined to say if Inco has been approached about any possible takeover. Despite big price swings in recent weeks for the rust-resistant metal, used to make stainless steel and other products, Inco executives argue that voracious demand from China's fast-developing economy will fuel a prolonged period of high demand and prices -- rather than the classic cyclical bust that has repeatedly crimped the company's earnings in the past. Lots of commodity producers are pinning their hopes on China these days, but for Inco the next couple of years are especially crucial. Its long-delayed, $5 billion Voisey's Bay mine in remote northern Labrador, Canada, is expected to finally start producing by year's end, and the $1.9 billion Goro nickel mine in New Caledonia is scheduled to start turning out nickel two years later. \"I believe China is creating something the world hasn't seen before,\" said Peter Goudie, Inco's executive vice president, marketing. \"It is developing so quickly and in such a sustained manner\" and absorbing ever-growing amounts of nickel, he said. On the supply side, inventories on the London Metal Exchange remain scarce at only a few days of supply. Voisey's Bay is the only major new nickel mine coming on stream anytime soon, Mr. Goudie said. \"It's a recipe for the market to remain very tight\" through at least next year, Mr. Goudie said. But not everyone believes nickel can sustain its current price levels of about $6.80 a pound for much longer. \"That's just way too much,\" said Jim Lowrey, an analyst with Metals Economics Group in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The high price will curtail demand as end users seek alternatives to stainless steel and trigger more recycled scrap nickel, he said. Few analysts, however, see nickel prices retracing to the lows of about $2 a pound seen in 2001, which crippled Inco's profits, in the foreseeable future. In the meantime, Inco is on a roll. Last year the Toronto company's net income quadrupled to $612 million, or $2.99 a share, while revenue soared 73% to $4.3 billion. First-half net income this year reached $528 million, or $2.41 a share. Inco's share price is nearly double its level of two years ago, giving the company a current market value of about $8 billion. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Inco was at $41.25, down $1.38. By year's end, Inco expects production to begin at Voisey's Bay, a nickel property that Inco acquired a decade ago. Inco has spent more than $5 billion to acquire and develop the mine, which was delayed for years by squabbling with local native groups and requirements by the Newfoundland provincial government for Inco to build local refining infrastructure. The mine is expected to produce some 110 million pounds of nickel next year, helping Inco's overall nickel production to reach about 540 million pounds, compared with its forecast of 490 million to 500 million pounds this year. In nickel markets of yesteryear, new mines such as Voisey's Bay would risk swamping demand for the metal, which is used in a wide range of applications, including airplane engines, batteries, restaurant appliances, construction materials, cutlery, pots and pans, and, yes, even the kitchen sink. \"It's different this time,\" said Inco's Mr. Goudie, who has been to China nearly every month this year. China absorbs about 12% to 15% of Inco's nickel output, and the figure is \"growing fast,\" he said. The planned construction of about 40 nuclear-power plants in the country during the next 15 years, for example, will require some 44 million pounds of nickel, he said. Some big investors share that view. \"You can't deny the fact China is making the cycle different for all metals,\" said Diana Racanelli, vice president of global equity research for Toronto money manager TAL Global Asset Management Inc., a major Inco shareholder. With few other near-term sources of new nickel supply, \"I don't think there's enough out there to make a big difference\" to currently firm nickel prices, she said. Meanwhile, Inco is trying to keep the New Caledonia project from running into some of the same obstacles that slowed the Voisey's Bay development. The project in the nickel-rich South Pacific island faces growing opposition from local native groups, elected officials and environmental groups, according to the Mineral Policy Institute, an Australia-based watchdog for environmental and social issues in the mining industry. An Inco spokesman dismissed the criticism, saying the New Caledonia government and community leaders support the mine, and Inco has no plans to interrupt construction.",
        "debiased_text": "Global mining companies are pursuing deals with nickel producers, and Canada's Inco Ltd. is investing billions under the assumption that favorable market conditions will continue. Recently, Swiss mining company Xstrata PLC agreed to acquire approximately 20% of Canada's Falconbridge Ltd., the world's third-largest nickel producer, for $1.7 billion. Falconbridge had previously been acquired by Noranda Inc., a Canadian base-metals producer, which subsequently adopted the Falconbridge name. Speculation had linked Xstrata to Inco, Falconbridge's competitor and the world's second-largest nickel producer by output. The Xstrata-Falconbridge deal has raised questions about whether Inco might pursue a partnership with another major mining firm, though Inco has stated it intends to remain independent. Inco CEO Scott Hand stated that the company believes high nickel prices will enable it to complete two new mining projects, significantly boosting production and cash flow. Hand did not comment on whether Inco had received takeover inquiries. While nickel prices have fluctuated recently, Inco executives anticipate sustained high demand and prices due to growth in China's economy, rather than a cyclical downturn as seen in the past. Many commodity producers are relying on Chinese demand, but the next few years are particularly significant for Inco. Its $5 billion Voisey's Bay mine in Labrador, Canada, delayed by negotiations with local groups and government requirements, is expected to begin production by the end of the year. Another project, the $1.9 billion Goro mine in New Caledonia, is scheduled to start operations in two years. Inco executives, including marketing VP Peter Goudie, attribute tight market conditions to limited supply and strong demand, with only Voisey's Bay set to add significant new nickel production in the near term. However, some analysts, such as Jim Lowrey of Metals Economics Group, predict that high prices may reduce demand as users switch to alternatives or recycle scrap nickel. Still, most analysts do not expect prices to fall to historic lows seen in 2001. Inco's financial performance has improved, with net income rising to $612 million last year and $528 million in the first half of this year. Its stock price has nearly doubled over two years, valuing the company at approximately $8 billion. Voisey's Bay is projected to produce 110 million pounds of nickel next year, increasing Inco's total output to around 540 million pounds compared to this year's forecast of 490-500 million pounds. Goudie noted China's increasing nickel consumption, citing infrastructure projects like planned nuclear plants as key drivers. Investors such as Diana Racanelli of TAL Global Asset Management agree that Chinese demand is altering traditional market cycles. Meanwhile, Inco is working to avoid delays at the New Caledonia project, where local opposition has been reported by the Mineral Policy Institute. An Inco spokesperson stated that construction remains on schedule with government and community support."

Number of spies depends on how you count them\nHao Fengjun, apparently a former member of China's State Security Bureau, has been dropping hints about his knowledge of Beijing's overseas spying operations to persuade the Australian government to give him political asylum.\nAmong the snippets Hao has let slip is that Beijing has about 1,000 spies in Canada.\nThat's a nice round number and it probably will come as no surprise to the people in the RCMP and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, who are paid to keep tabs on such things.\nBut when claims such as Hao's surface in a multicultural, immigrant nation such as Canada, it is as well to look at the situation coolly and calmly because there is a risk that large sections of this community could be stigmatized.\nThere is no doubt that Canada has been a target of Chinese intelligence operations for many years. This interest predates the creation of China's main civilian intelligence-gathering agency, the Ministry of State Security, in 1983 by amalgamating the security functions of the Ministry of Public Security and the investigations department of the Communist Party central committee.\nBefore 1983, Beijing's main aim was to counter anti-communist opposition in the Chinese diaspora communities in North America and Europe, especially among Taiwanese immigrants and mainland refugees.\nCanada became a country of greater interest to the Chinese intelligence services when, around 1984, large numbers of people from Hong Kong began emigrating for fear of what would happen when the territory was returned to Beijing's rule in 1997.\nThis coincided with China's economic reforms beginning to take hold and the realization in Beijing that it needed to acquire Western technology to become a powerful country. Technical and industrial espionage became a focus and one joint RCMP-CSIS study in 1997 estimated 200 Canadian companies had been bought by what it saw as a dangerous alliance of Hong Kong tycoons, triad criminal gangs and Chinese intelligence services.\nThat judgment gives a hint of the difficulties in assessing what constitutes an espionage incursion into Canada that warrants attention by Canadian agencies.\nThe 1997 report, code-named Sidewinder, is an overly emotional document and not particularly rigorous in its analysis. It is not surprising the report was substantially rewritten and edited, as well as being renamed Echo, before becoming part of the Canadian intelligence services' library.",
        "debiased_text": "Hao Fengjun, reportedly a former member of China's State Security Bureau, has shared information about Beijing's overseas intelligence operations as part of his efforts to obtain political asylum in Australia. Among his claims is that China has approximately 1,000 intelligence operatives in Canada.

Claims like Hao's emerge periodically in countries with large immigrant populations, including Canada. Canada has been a focus of Chinese intelligence operations for several decades, a pattern that began before the establishment of China's Ministry of State Security in 1983, which consolidated security functions from other agencies. Prior to 1983, Chinese intelligence efforts in North America and Europe primarily targeted anti-communist opposition within Chinese diaspora communities, particularly among Taiwanese immigrants and mainland refugees. Chinese intelligence activities in Canada intensified around 1984 when many Hong Kong residents emigrated ahead of the territory's 1997 handover to China. This period also coincided with China's economic reforms and its pursuit of Western technology. A 1997 joint RCMP-CSIS study estimated that 200 Canadian companies had been acquired by groups with alleged connections to Hong Kong business interests and Chinese intelligence. The study, initially code-named Sidewinder, was later revised and renamed Echo before being archived by Canadian intelligence services."

Mr. Bush expects to deliver the message personally to China's president, Hu Jintao, during an Asian tour that begins next week. \"I will remind him that this government believes they should continue to advance toward market-based evaluation of their currency for the sake of the world, not just for the sake of bilateral relations,\" Mr. Bush told a group of Asian reporters this week. The currency issue has been a sticking point in U.S.-Chinese economic relations for years, with many American manufacturing executives and unions complaining that by fixing the yuan at an artificially low value, Beijing gives Chinese firms an unfair edge over their U.S. competitors. Facing growing antitrade sentiment among lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Beijing let the currency rise by 2.1% against the dollar in July. Chinese authorities presented the move as a signal that they were allowing market forces to influence the yuan's value, implying they would let its value increase in response to supply and demand. But the country's central bank hasn't allowed the currency to budge since then, and Treasury Secretary John Snow has made it clear in recent months that the administration expects China to allow a more significant rise -- and soon. \"The Chinese took a good first step on having a market currency,\" Mr. Bush told China's Phoenix Television in a separate interview. \"I believe they ought to do more.\" China's central bank vowed this week to continue liberalizing its financial system, including the currency, but indicated it would proceed cautiously. The Treasury Department was supposed to issue a semiannual report last month on world currencies, in which it would have to decide whether to formally accuse China of manipulating its currency for trade gains. The administration has delayed issuing the report at least until after Mr. Bush returns. Also yesterday, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressional advisory panel, recommended a series of initiatives that it wants Congress to undertake, including being more aggressive in filing cases against China with the World Trade Organization on issues such as Beijing's alleged \"currency manipulation\" and its failure to rein in intellectual property violations. The panel also said Congress should bar U.S. companies from giving Beijing information about Chinese users or authors of online content, as happened in a recent case involving Yahoo Inc.",

In recent remarks to Asian reporters, Bush stated that he plans to reiterate the U.S. position that China should move toward a market-based valuation of its currency. The yuan's exchange rate has been a consistent topic in U.S.-China economic discussions. In July, China adjusted the yuan's value by 2.1% against the dollar, describing it as part of allowing market forces to influence the currency. However, no further adjustments have been made since that time. U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow has indicated that the administration expects additional movement on this issue. China's central bank has stated it will continue working toward financial system liberalization while maintaining a cautious approach. The U.S. Treasury Department delayed its semiannual report on global currencies until after President Bush's trip. Separately, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressional advisory group, proposed several measures for Congress to consider, including potential WTO cases related to currency valuation and intellectual property protection, as well as restrictions on U.S. companies sharing user information with Chinese authorities."

        "original_text": "China rejected yesterday a detailed prescription from Washington for a quick move to a more flexible exchange rate system, beginning with a 10 per cent revaluation of the renminbi. The US proposal also generated scepticism from China-based analysts, who said a large one-off revaluation would run against the gradualist traditions of Chinese policymaking and undermine the government's mantra of exchange rate \"stability\". A foreign ministry spokesman, in response to questions about a Financial Times report that the US Treasury had made a revaluation demand via unofficial envoys, said many US visitors had come to China recently carrying \"such messages\" about revaluation. But he repeated Beijing's view that it would not bow to foreign pressure on the issue. \"China will not do this when internal conditions are not ripe, no matter how great the external pressure is,\" said the spokesman, Kong Quan. China has long said it will dump the decade-old peg to the US dollar in favour of a more flexible exchange rate system, but it has not commented on the timing of such a move. Ha Jiming, chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, the country's largest investment bank, said that, although the timing was right for a change in currency policy, 10 per cent was too large a move at the beginning. \"It remains too risky to relax the peg too much, so China may well start from a 5 per cent revaluation then repeg the renminbi to a basket of currency,\" said Mr Ha. Zuo Xiaolei, chief economist with Galaxy Securities, said the currency had now become a political rather than economic issue, militating against a large move. \"The making of decisions in China is mostly consensus-based ...so that might lead to a compromise of a 3to 5 per cent rise in the renminbi's value.\" * European Union and Chinese trade officials were yesterday discussing ways to avoid a potentially damaging stand-off over textiles imports from China, writes Tobias Buck in Brussels. Peter Mandelson, the EU trade commissioner, last night met Gao Hucheng, China's special textiles negotiator. Mr Mandelson also discussed the issue with Bo Xilai, the Chinese commerce minister, earlier in the day. Failure to find a negotiated settlement would spark the imposition of unilateral safeguard measures by the EU to reduce Chinese shipments of T-shirts and flax yarn.",
        "debiased_text": "China responded yesterday to a US proposal for a quicker transition to a more flexible exchange rate system, which included an initial 10% revaluation of the renminbi. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson addressed reports that the US Treasury had conveyed this request through unofficial channels, confirming that many recent US visitors had discussed revaluation. The spokesperson reiterated China's position that it would not act on external pressure, stating, 'China will not do this when internal conditions are not ripe, no matter how great the external pressure is.' China has maintained its intention to shift from the US dollar peg to a more flexible system but has not specified when this might occur. Analysts in China noted that a 10% revaluation would be inconsistent with the country's incremental policy approach. Ha Jiming, chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, suggested a smaller initial adjustment of 5%, followed by pegging the renminbi to a basket of currencies. Zuo Xiaolei, chief economist at Galaxy Securities, observed that currency policy had become a politically sensitive issue, making consensus-based decision-making likely to result in a more modest adjustment. Separately, EU and Chinese trade officials met to discuss textiles trade, with EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson holding talks with Chinese officials to prevent potential trade restrictions on Chinese textile exports."

        "original_text": "Travel broadens the mind. Gordon Brown has always been fond of statistics, usually cited as evidence of how well the British economy is doing under his stewardship. But his recent trip to China provided him with some less encouraging numbers. As he noted on his return, some 300,000 Chinese graduate in science and engineering each year, compared with 100,000 in Britain. In relative terms, given the Chinese population, that is not too bad a gap. But the disparity in absolute numbers is one of the big economic challenges facing western countries, including the UK. Since Mr Brown never came across an economic challenge with which he did not want to grapple in minute detail, that gives him material for however long he remains chancellor. The China challenge covers a vast range of microeconomic matters, from education achievement to investment in research and development. To the extent that a government has direct control over a country's microeconomic performance, Mr Brown seems to have sensible aims. But he is clearly in the diminishing returns phase of his chancellorship. Nothing much will compare with the government's early decisions to cede responsibility for monetary policy and invest more in education. The first of these encouraged macroeconomic stability, one of the most important factors in encouraging long-term investment. The second one boosted Britain's effort to make up its historic deficit, compared with other countries, in the proportion of young people going into higher education. Both of the decisions have already had encouraging effects on the country's growth record and prospects. It is no coincidence that Britain's most globally competitive companies, including BP, GlaxoSmithKline, Royal Bank of Scotland and Rolls-Royce, depend heavily on attracting skilled graduates and - particularly in science and engineering - postgraduates. Many of these recruits now come from other countries but the more people complete degrees at UK universities the better. Rolls-Royce is a good example of how a company can benefit from excellence in academic research. Its partnerships with universities not only allow it to get more from its research budget (it can encourage the kind of applied engineering research from which it will benefit) but allows it to attract the best engineering specialists. It is applying that model both in Britain and other countries where it operates. The result is a British company making the kind of products that are hardest for Chinese competitors to imitate. Both Rolls-Royce and General Electric of the US, its main competitor in civil aerospace, are confident about Chinese competition. Aircraft engines are so complex and contain such advanced technology that there is a high barrier to entry. So far so good, but how far should any government venture beyond areas that are clearly its province - education and macroeconomic policy - into encouraging the creation of more Rolls-Royces and GlaxoSmithKlines? Not only does it risk wasting public money but a government policy for R&D, science or vocational education can easily turn into a covert industrial policy. In this regard, the Budget's fine print is encouraging. Probably through lack of money, perhaps through lack of inclination, none of the industrial measures grouped under the category of \"meeting the productivity challenge\" were as far-reaching or ambitious as Mr Brown's Budget speech rhetoric suggested. Most of the specifics were to do with education reform. The co-ordination of public and private research funding for science and innovation, including the UK's stem cell initiative, is sensible. After all, public investment through the National Institutes of Health is one reason why pharmaceutical companies find the US a good place for R&D. It is more questionable whether the government has a proper role in encouraging creativity and the wider use of good industrial design. But by raising the challenge of China and India without throwing large amounts of public money at areas outside the government's competence, Mr Brown seems broadly on the right track. Once a government has contributed a strong education system and macroeconomic stability, it is up to a nation's entrepreneurs and companies to respond. john.gapper@ft.com",
        "debiased_text": "During a recent trip to China, Gordon Brown noted that approximately 300,000 Chinese students graduate in science and engineering annually, compared to 100,000 in Britain. The difference in absolute numbers represents one of the economic challenges facing Western countries, including the UK. The comparison covers various microeconomic aspects, from educational attainment to research and development investment. Under Brown's tenure as chancellor, the UK government implemented policies transferring monetary policy responsibility and increasing education investment, which contributed to macroeconomic stability and expanded higher education participation. These decisions have influenced the country's economic growth. British companies such as BP, GlaxoSmithKline, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Rolls-Royce rely on skilled graduates, particularly in science and engineering. Rolls-Royce collaborates with universities on research, benefiting from applied engineering studies and attracting specialized talent. The company operates similarly in other countries where it does business. Governments generally focus on education and macroeconomic policy, with debate over how far they should intervene to foster specific industries. The UK Budget included measures for science and innovation funding coordination, including stem cell research, but did not implement extensive industrial policies. Public investment, such as through the National Institutes of Health in the U.S., can influence private sector R&D location decisions. While the government's role in promoting creativity and industrial design is debated, Brown has framed the economic challenges posed by China and India without allocating significant public funds beyond governmental responsibilities. After establishing education and macroeconomic conditions, private sector initiative plays a key role in economic response."

        "original_text": "Beijing needs to address the \"structural imbalances\" in trade with the US, Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, said yesterday, citing the responsibilities that came with the growing global clout of the Chinese economy. Although the focus of Ms Rice's visit to Beijing, the last stop in a week-long trip through the region, was security issues, she said she had also discussed trade with Chinese leaders. The US deficit with China in 2004 was Dollars 162bn, the largest recorded with a single country and the catalyst for a revival of concerns in Beijing official circles that Washington may impose retaliatory measures. \"It is really critical that people know China is acting within the recognised rules of the international economy and there is an understanding of the responsibility that comes with rapid economic growth,\" Ms Rice said. Wu Yi, China's vice-premier, said Beijing attached \"great importance\" to the deficit but insisted the trade between the two countries was \"complementary rather than competitive\". Ms Wu also blamed the two countries' different methods of calculating the trade imbalance - China says the deficit is only Dollars 80bn - for exacerbating the problem. The US counts exports from Hong Kong as Chinese exports, and China does not include exports from the mainland to the US from China-based American companies. The first test on trade will be over textiles, with US manufacturers and unions already demanding that Washington reimpose quotas on Chinese exports after a jump in sales to the US in January and February this year. Sales of some lines of Chinese-made clothing to the US rose by more 1,000 per cent year-on-year in January after the lifting of longstanding quotas at the end of 2004. On North Korea, Ms Rice reiterated her call for China to use its influence to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table \"in a constructive manner\".",

Rice noted that the US trade deficit with China reached $162 billion in 2004, the highest ever recorded with a single country. She emphasized the importance of China adhering to international economic rules and understanding the responsibilities accompanying its rapid economic growth. Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Yi stated that Beijing considers the trade deficit a significant issue but maintained that trade between the two countries is complementary rather than competitive. Wu Yi also pointed out differences in how the two nations calculate the trade imbalance—China estimates the deficit at $80 billion, as their method excludes exports from Hong Kong and mainland exports by US-based companies. A key upcoming trade issue involves textiles, with US manufacturers and unions calling for the reinstatement of quotas on Chinese exports following a sharp increase in sales to the US in January and February this year. Some Chinese-made clothing sales to the US rose by over 1,000% year-on-year in January after the removal of long-standing quotas in late 2004. Regarding North Korea, Rice reiterated her request for China to use its influence to facilitate North Korea's return to negotiations in a constructive manner."

        "title": "When the PM came round for tea",
        "original_text": "The year before last, a 37-year-old performance artist named Mark McGowan launched a protest against student debt by pushing a peanut through the streets of London with his nose. His 11-day, seven-mile journey ended at the doorstep of 10 Downing Street, where it presented the prime minister's staff with a dilemma. How are you supposed to respond to such a visitor? Ignoring him completely could seem haughty and humourless, but engaging with him too much risks making the government look silly. What you need is a simple gesture that crosses all divides - uniting well-paid ministers with indebted ex-students, and forging a connection between serious politicians and the kind of people who push peanuts through London with their noses. So the government of Tony Blair reached a solution it had tried and tested over several years. An official, one news report recorded at the time, \"handed him a mug of tea\". The mug of tea made another prominent appearance on Monday, when Blair and his deputy John Prescott went round to Sharon Williams's house for a cuppa. Something about the way the three of them held themselves suggested that this was not necessarily a regular occurrence. But the unofficial election campaign has begun, and Williams, a 33-year-old manager for BT, lives on a west London housing estate where residents are to be given an equity stake in their properties - part of the government's plan to get 300,000 more people on to the property ladder. And so Blair and Prescott posed for the cameras, sipped from mugs on her bal cony, and left her with a housewarming gift: four more mugs, and a teapot, all from Habitat. You didn't have to be Umberto Eco to figure out the semiotics: the man of the people had come to call. Let it be noted, furthermore, that the prime minister's commitment to cutting the cost of government had even prompted him to buy mugs that had been reduced in the Habitat new year sale from £3.50 each to just £1.70. (The product line, called Tesso, is about to be discontinued, suggesting that it may not truly be a mug of the people.) The teapot, unattractively named Silo, was also discounted, selling for £10.40 yesterday, down from £13. Responsible stewardship of public revenue starts small. National leaders, needless to say, don't really drop in on ordinary householders, except when they're played by Hugh Grant in Love Actually. But we suspend our disbelief for films and election campaigns alike, and this fact has permitted Blair energetically to exploit his favourite symbol of classlessness. It started with the campaign mugs of the 1997 election, but look through the archives from then until now: here he is outside Number 10 in 2000, as baby Leo arrives home from hospital, clutching a mug featuring a photograph of his family, and in Redditch and Camden and Birmingham and east London, meeting regular people, ordinary tea-drinkers, and once again mugging for the cameras. Oh, and on the sofa, on GMTV, cuppa in hand, withholding no secrets from viewers: \"I love my cup of tea. I can't do without that.\" None of this is remotely accidental, of course. \"Tea does act as an equaliser,\" says Jane Pettigrew, arguably our foremost tea expert and author of A Social History of Tea. \"There's something about it that means, when you're sitting drinking it, you forget who you are, and where you come from. It brings people together.\" When tea first caught on among the wealthy in England in the 17th century, the poor couldn't afford it, but by the 19th it was firmly entrenched as our national drink, and Queen Victoria was holding tea parties for the wives of soldiers fighting in the Boer war. Tea bridged class divides without actually dissolving them, which was just how the elite liked it. But the mug, the mug. Pettigrew isn't happy about the mug. \"I must admit I'm a bit of a purist,\" she says. \"I nearly always drink my tea from a cup and saucer. Mugs are thicker, and chunkier. It means that the tea cools down much more quickly. And there's nowhere to put your spoon.\" The most celebrated recent example of the mysterious power of tea didn't involve Blair, though, but the Queen. In July 1999, she visited Susan McCarron, a resident of Dougrie Gardens on the Craigdale estate, in Glasgow, who had had her home adapted for her special needs. The encounter was remarkable for the degree to which it should have been excruciating, yet wasn't. Both women seemed entirely at ease as they drank out of McCarron's best china around a table in the dead centre of the low-ceilinged living-room. \"I found her very easy to talk to,\" McCarron said afterwards. It would be hard to find two people further away from each other on the spectrum of privilege than the Queen and McCarron. Why, then, did their meeting work so well, while there is there always such an unmistakable grating sense of awkwardness about the prime minister's mug-in-hand appearances? \"Somehow it's less of a problem if it's the Queen,\" says Joe Kerr, head of the department of critical and historical studies at the Royal College of Art. \"If you're going to have a queen at all, then that's just what she does. But Tony Blair constructs these images of himself very carefully. Just the other day it was him in a pub having pints of beer with grateful workers from his constituency. And it just looks incredibly cynical.\" This may have something to do with the complexity of class codes in a country that, whatever Blair may wish, is nowhere near to being free of them. Aristocrats, and the royal family, drink tea; working-class people drink tea. \"But even though it's a great symbol of social levelling, our image of Blair's class, the managerial haute-bourgeois, is that they don't drink tea,\" Kerr says. \"They drink coffee, or claret, or designer bottled water. I don't think tea exists in Islington. And for the gift to be from Habitat doubles the insult. It's intensely condescending. Tony and Cherie would shop on the Fulham Road, at the Conran shop. Or they'd buy extremely expensive recreations of cheap earthenware.\" In fact, the evidence that Blair is a genuinely committed tea-drinker is strong: he told GMTV viewers that he had been forced to give up coffee after his heart problems, and he has rarely been seen drinking wine. But which drink he really likes isn't really relevant. It's the symbolism that counts, as Labour knows only too well. There is another complicating factor: we don't drink tea in the ways that we used to. As Pettigrew knows and laments, \"there's a feeling that people have lost the traditional business of sitting down to tea\" - something that the British Tea Council, with whom she works, strives hard to reverse. And in this light, Blair's housewarming gift begins to seem a little weird. The traditional bone-china tea service - cups and saucers and a teapot - was rather formal, and a little staid, but at least it brought people together. The single tea-bag in the single mug is informal but solitary: perhaps an all-too-appropriate symbol of our atomised times. What, then, are we to infer from a gift of four mugs and a teapot? It's the third way of drinking tea, positioned confusingly somewhere between the other two extremes. The ideal set-up, in fact, should the prime minister happen to call round for a quick cuppa, which he won't. 'He tries so hard to look working class' Steve Perry, retail designer Ugh, I don't like it at all. I think china should be pure white, so you can see it's clean. I think it's a bad choice for a present, although given I don't like Tony Blair I would probably say that anyway. I want Gordon Brown in and I wrote to Downing Street to tell them that. Gordon would never have chosen anything so tacky. He's Scottish; he'd have much better taste. I reckon Tony came into Habitat and said: \"What can I get them that's bright, cheerful and working class?\" and grabbed this. He tries so hard to look working class, but he's not. Look at his wife, for God's sake - she has more money than anyone else in the country. Luq Adejumo, creative projects manager These mugs are a bit of a bizarre choice for a present for someone he didn't know - one wouldn't normally choose such a gaudy pattern for a stranger. I think the man's awful, but I don't think he's cynical enough to have chosen Labour colours on purpose. I guess the choice of the mug says he's the common man, a man of the people - or at least that's the idea, even though he has a mansion in Chelsea or wherever. Eric Graham, 57, manager of Spitalfields market Mugs are just more practical than china, and it reinforces Blair's working-class self-image, of him heading back up to his constituency in the north-east and saying, \"Look at me, I'm the prime minister, but I still like drinking tea.\" I like Blair, actually; I like what he's trying to do. He's created a fine balance between the Conservatives and Labour. You could say he's chosen the design because it's an ethnic kind of pattern - bold and bright. And the fact it's 50% off might suggest he's taken his cue from Cherie. Melanie Hunt, housewife He probably didn't choose the espresso cups because he wants to appeal to the lorry drivers across the land, drinking mugs of tea in roadside breakfast caffs. I did have great faith in Blair, but as a result of recent world events I have lost all hope in him. I think he has blood on his hands. Chris Thomas, student from the US Maybe this shows he is a bit cheap, seeing as it was reduced. It's a very safe option. Maybe he's not creative enough to come up with a better present - anyone can come up with mugs. I don't have so much of an opinion on him. All I know is that he's our ally and that he helped us out in the war. Everyone says he's been a good ally. I know that the war has caused a lot of anger, but before that he was doing a good job.",

The Tesso mugs were reduced from £3.50 to £1.70, and the Silo teapot was priced at £10.40, down from £13. Blair has previously been seen with tea during public appearances, including during the 1997 election campaign and other events. Tea has historical significance in Britain as a social beverage, with roots in both aristocratic and working-class traditions. Jane Pettigrew, a tea historian, noted tea's role as a social equalizer, though she expressed a preference for cups and saucers over mugs. In 1999, Queen Elizabeth II visited Susan McCarron in Glasgow, where they shared tea using McCarron's china. Joe Kerr of the Royal College of Art commented on the perceived authenticity of such interactions, noting differences in public reception between royal and political figures. Public reactions to Blair's gift varied, with some questioning the choice of mugs and others viewing it as a gesture of relatability. The event occurred as part of broader political activities ahead of an upcoming election."

        "title": "How high can the oil price go? And when will it start to hit us where it hurts?",
        "original_text": "How high can it go and when will it start to hurt? This may sound like something the actress should ask the bishop but the question is, in fact, about oil. Black gold, as it is also known, smashed through the $66 a barrel level last week, its highest ever, and has risen 10% this month alone. It is up more than 100% since the spring of last year, when prices were bobbling around the $30 a barrel level until the latest run-up began and carried on, and on, to where we are now. Bizarrely, though, the world economy appears to have come through relatively unscathed, so far at least. The global downturns that followed the oil shocks of 1974, following the Yom Kippur war in 1973, and the Iranian revolution of 1979, are recorded in all the economic textbooks. One could be forgiven for deducing that global recessions follow oil shocks as night follows day. The stock market does not read it that way, however. Last week's record highs in crude prices coincided with stock markets highs. The FTSE 100 rose to its best in nearly four years; the FTSE 250 hit an all-time high. Either stock markets are celebrating the fact that the world economy has not been blown off course or they are celebrating record profits at oil companies, which make up 20% of the FTSE 100, or they think oil no longer matters. But the latter is open to question. What has happened in Britain since oil prices shot up is that growth has slowed sharply, consumer spending has dropped back and inflation has risen, although only to the Bank of England's target of 2%. But it is not clear to what extent this is due to oil, or the Bank's rate rises early last year, or the ending of the house price boom. Disentangling cause and effect in economics is never easy and this is a good example of it. But it would be brave to argue that a sharp increase in energy costs has had nothing to do with it. Oil impacts on an economy in two ways: on prices and on activity. Inflation can be pushed up easily by oil. The most obvious way is through prices at the pump but the other way is that companies pass on any cost rises they suffer to customers in the form of higher prices. In Britain little of this has happened, mainly because of the intense price pressure on the high street, which has forced firms to take the higher costs on to their bottom line. This is well illustrated by recent data on producer prices. They showed firms' input costs had jumped 13% over the past year, the highest since records began 20 years ago. Prices that firms were able to charge for their goods were only up 3%. That's a big gap and it must be hurting some companies. This is how the hit comes on activity, through company profits. Facing a big rise in costs, companies may either have to lay off workers or cut investment spending because they have less money, and so on. So why has the British economy, and indeed others, not succumbed to the power of high oil prices so far? There are several likely answers. One is that the industrialised economies have become much more efficient in their use of oil in recent decades, so are in theory less vulnerable to a rise in prices. Another is that oil has not, yet, risen as far as it did in 1974 or 1979. In 1974 it quadrupled to nearly $12 a barrel, whereas today it has \"only\" doubled. After the 1979 shock, it tripled again to over $30 a barrel, equivalent to about $80 today after allowing for inflation. So we are still not back, in real terms, to the prices we had back in 1980. Furthermore, firms in Britain, and others countries, are enjoying a cyclical high in profits now, so are better placed to absorb higher energy prices - for a while anyway. Consumers are aided by the fact that tax makes up three-quarters of the price of a litre of fuel, meaning the doubling of oil prices has not seen a doubling of prices at the pump. Although pump prices have set records above 90p a litre, prices are in fact up about 30%, rather than the 115% crude has risen. In the US, though, tax is far lower, and last week the average pump prices there rose to nearly $2.40 a US gallon, equivalent to 35p a litre here. Although it's tempting to say, \"the US motorist does not know he is born\", from an economic point of view it matters that prices have doubled in the US because motorists there drive more than we do. So how come American consumers are still spending like mad? Stuart Thomson of stock broker Charles Stanley reckons Americans have run down their savings to carry on spending in spite of higher petrol prices. They borrowed $55bn against the inflated values of their homes in the second quarter to keep on spending - encouraged, too, by what Thomson calls the \"suicidal\" recent price cuts by General Motors. The latest oil price rise represents a tax hike of more than $70bn on the US economy, he says, and at some point that has to have an effect on the US consumer, especially as the Federal Reserve is steadily raising interest rates. \"It would be extremely foolish to write off the US consumer. Homo Americanus is the most optimistic of creatures, forever given to chasing rainbows,\" says Thomson. What has happened in the US, however, is that people have given up buying SUVs. So there is always an upside to a rise in oil prices, namely that people may start using less. But the key reason that rising oil prices have not tipped the world into recession is, as Bank of England governor Mervyn King said last week, that the price has been driven up by soaring demand, not an interruption to supply. \"It is simply not a repeat of the 1970s,\" he said. World oil demand expanded at its fastest pace in 30 years last year, driven mainly by the US and China. That came at a time when there was little spare capacity in the world, particularly in oil cartel Opec. It was also driven by a lack of new refinery capacity, particularly in the US, and concerns about the stability of many countries in the Middle East. It's a very jittery market in which every piece of bad news pushes oil up and any piece of good news does not push it down. Where's it heading? Nobody knows, really. Some experts think it's going to $100 a barrel. The oil futures market sees it staying at current levels through the winter. But it thought that last autumn, and then oil dropped rapidly. Others think it could fall fast quite soon as the US driving season ends and if the northern hemisphere winter is not too cold, thereby relieving demand for heating oil. You only have to look at a graph of oil prices in recent years to see how volatile they can be. Fortunes have been made and lost trying to predict prices. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman and former Shell economist, reminded us on this page last week of the old adage that \"high oil prices lead to low oil prices\". Every price spike contains the seeds of its own doom. High prices eventually choke off demand, which pushes the price down. We may reach that point quite soon, but nobody knows. Longer term, of course, oil will run out, but we are not nearly there yet. We had the global equity market bubble of the late 1990s, then the housing bubble of the past few years. Now we may be seeing an oil price bubble that will burst at some point. That would justify stock market optimism. But if oil goes to $80 or more and stays there we could be in real trouble, and the stock market may turn out to have been hopelessly optimistic. ashley.seager@theguardian.com",

Historical economic downturns, such as those following the 1973 Yom Kippur War and the 1979 Iranian Revolution, were linked to oil shocks, but current stock market trends do not reflect similar concerns. The FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 both reached multi-year highs last week. The relationship between oil prices and economic performance remains complex, with factors like central bank policies and housing market trends also influencing outcomes. In Britain, economic growth has slowed, consumer spending has declined, and inflation has risen to the Bank of England's 2% target, though the exact impact of oil prices is unclear. Higher energy costs can affect economies through inflation and reduced business activity, but recent producer price data shows firms absorbing much of the cost increases. Industrialized economies have become more energy-efficient in recent decades, potentially mitigating some effects of rising oil prices. Current oil prices, adjusted for inflation, remain below peaks seen in 1980. In the U.S., lower fuel taxes mean pump prices have not risen as sharply as crude oil prices, though American motorists face higher costs overall. U.S. consumer spending remains robust, supported by borrowing against home equity and corporate incentives like automotive discounts. Analysts note that sustained high oil prices could eventually impact consumer behavior. Bank of England Governor Mervyn King attributed rising oil prices to strong global demand rather than supply disruptions, distinguishing the current situation from the 1970s oil crises. Global oil demand grew at its fastest rate in 30 years last year, driven by the U.S. and China, amid limited spare production capacity and refining constraints. Market volatility persists, with uncertainty about future price movements. Some analysts predict prices could reach $100 per barrel, while others anticipate a decline post-winter. Long-term trends suggest high prices may eventually curb demand, leading to corrections. The possibility of an oil price bubble has been raised, though its duration and impact remain uncertain."

        "original_text": "On October 30 2001, a crowd of US and Ukrainian officials gathered in Pervomaisk, southern Ukraine, where, together with local schoolchildren, they set off an explosion that destroyed the last nuclear missile silo in the former Soviet republic. The spectacular ceremony was supposed to mark the end of Ukraine's membership of the nuclear weapons club. But hopes it would lay to rest western fears that Soviet weapons left in Ukraine might fall into the wrong hands appear to have been dashed. At least 26 nuclear-capable cruise missiles, emptied of their atomic warheads, ended up on the international black market if allegations aired this week by amember of Ukraine's parliament are true. Grigory Omelchenko, who has investigated other Ukrainian arms- trading cases, says the SBU secret police are prosecuting one of its former officers, identified as Mr V.V. Yevdokimov, for selling 12 Kh- 55 cruise missiles between 1999 and 2001 - six each to Iran and China - and attempting to sell 14 more last year. Designed to be launched by Russian Tupolev bombers, the Kh-55s (known as AS15s in the west) can fly up to 3000km, hugging the ground to avoid air defences. The SBU has declined to comment. It says only that Mr Yevdokimov was arrested last April and charged with \"smuggling military goods outside Ukraine in 2001 and other crimes\". Mr Yevdokimov headed the air cargo company UkrAviaZakaz. Mr Omelchenko claims senior former government officials were also involved and he is demanding the SBU reveal more information about the investigation. A US State Department spokesman declined to comment on the reported investigation into the Kh-55 affair. But he noted that preventing missile proliferation was an important element in the \"war on terror\" and that \"Ukraine is a partner with us in this war\". The Kh-55s could prove troublesome for Viktor Yushchenko, Ukraine's new president, who is eager to bury the country's image as the leading source of black-market arms. In his election campaign, Mr Yushchenko promised to \"say goodbye\" to arms-trading and other scandals. His predecessor, Leonid Kuchma, was implicated in an alleged plan to sell Dollars 100m (Euros 77m, Pounds 53m) worth of Kolchuga advanced early warning radars to Iraq. The man who allegedly proposed the deal, Valery Malev, then head of Ukraine's main arms-export company, died in a car crash soon after a recording implicating Mr Kuchma surfaced. Mr Kuchma insisted the tape was forged; the US said it was authentic. Other recordings made by the former guard, Mykola Melnychenko, allegedly revealed Mr Kuchma discussing the distribution of kickbacks under the UN's oil-for-food programme and deliveries of \"Grad\" surface-to-air missiles to Iran. The US never found any Kolchuga radar systems in Iraq, though a report by former UN weapons inspector Charles Duelfer last year said Yuri Orshansky, a Ukrainian businessman, had been one of Saddam Hussein's main arms suppliers. UN weapons inspectors had previously documented Mr Orshansky's involvement in arms deals dating back to 1993 as well as a visit by Iraqis to a nuclear research laboratory working on weapons-grade uranium. The Ukrainian government stripped Mr Orshansky of his status as honorary consul to Iraq, after international media publicised his weapons trading, but he continued to arrange illegal arms deliveries right up to the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, according to Mr Duelfer. Ukrainians have also been implicated in arms shipments to rebels in Sierra Leone. Yesterday US officials said they looked forward to increased co- operation from Ukraine on preventing weapons proliferation and other issues. Additional reporting by Guy Dinmore in Washington",
        "debiased_text": "On October 30, 2001, US and Ukrainian officials, along with local schoolchildren, attended a ceremony in Pervomaisk, southern Ukraine, where an explosion destroyed the last nuclear missile silo in the country. The event marked Ukraine's commitment to eliminating its nuclear weapons. However, allegations have emerged regarding the diversion of nuclear-capable cruise missiles. A Ukrainian parliamentary member, Grigory Omelchenko, stated that the SBU, Ukraine's secret police, is prosecuting a former officer, V.V. Yevdokimov, for allegedly selling 12 Kh-55 cruise missiles—six each to Iran and China—between 1999 and 2001, and attempting to sell 14 more in a later period. The Kh-55 missiles, with a range of up to 3000km, are designed for Russian Tupolev bombers. The SBU confirmed Yevdokimov's arrest in April on charges related to smuggling military goods but provided no further comment. Yevdokimov was head of the air cargo company UkrAviaZakaz. Omelchenko has called for more transparency in the investigation, suggesting involvement by former senior officials. A US State Department spokesperson acknowledged Ukraine's cooperation in non-proliferation efforts but declined to comment on the specific case. The allegations may present challenges for Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko, who has pledged to address past arms-trading scandals. His predecessor, Leonid Kuchma, faced accusations related to arms deals, including an alleged sale of early warning radars to Iraq, which he denied. Recordings by a former security officer implicated Kuchma in discussions about kickbacks and missile deliveries to Iran. A UN report identified a Ukrainian businessman, Yuri Orshansky, as a supplier to Saddam Hussein, though no Kolchuga radars were found in Iraq. Orshansky was removed as honorary consul to Iraq after media reports on his arms dealings. US officials have expressed interest in further cooperation with Ukraine on non-proliferation."

        "original_text": "In the world of diplomacy, the gestures do not get much bigger, or hairier, than this. China's campaign to woo Taiwan away from declaring independence took another turn yesterday with an offer of two giant pandas to mark the first meeting of the leaders of the Communist party and its historic foe, the Kuomintang, since the civil war ended in 1949. The \"panda diplomacy\" - for China, they represent the country's ultimate gift - was part of a charm offensive that also included an easing of restrictions on tourism and agricultural imports, designed to bolster support for Lien Chan, head of Taiwan's main opposition party. It followed a groundbreaking trip to the mainland by Mr Lien, whose Kuomintang party retreated to Taiwan from the mainland 56 years ago. Beijing has improved ties with its old enemy to split public opinion in Taiwan and press the island's independence-minded president, Chen Shui-bian, to reconcile with it. Mr Chen responded yesterday by inviting China's president, Hu Jintao, to visit the island state. During a visit to the state of Kiribati, in the south Pacific, Mr Chen said: \"Mainland China clearly lacks understanding about Taiwan and that is why there has been misjudgment and misunderstanding.\" The pandas are part of an intensifying carrot-and-stick campaign against Taiwanese separatism that has also seen China increase the number of missiles aimed at the island and pass an anti-secession law justifying the use of force to prevent independence. China has used panda diplomacy in the past. In the 70s it supplied zoos in the US and Europe as a sign of friendship after the restoration of full diplomatic ties. Taiwan has yet to accept the animals. Similar offers have been rejected in the past. Supporters of Mr Chen fear that the gesture is a ploy to foster unification. Beijing, however, was keener to talk about furry hugs. \"We hope the pandas, with their tame nature, air of nobleness and cuddly looks will bring joy and laughter to the Taiwan compatriots - children in particular,\" the Xinhua news agency quoted Chen Yunlin, head of the mainland Taiwan Affairs Office, as saying.",

        "original_text": "Text of report by Xu Ming, published by Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao web site on 4 April On 3 April, several web sites launched an anti-Japanese signature movement to oppose Japan's distortion of history and Japan's striving to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Tens of thousands of people have joined the signature movement. Some of them later marched to Japanese department stores to express dissatisfaction. Within five hours, some four to five thousand people demonstrated in front of five Japanese stores. The Shenzhen Public Security Bureau helped maintain order. There were no clashes. Commenting on this, an expert called on the people to be rational when holding anti-Japanese activities as people's inappropriate and excessive acts could produce a negative impact. At 1100 on 3 April, people that took part in demonstration began gathering in front of the Grand Hotel at Huaqiang North Road. Some of them spread a long banner for signing. Nearby citizens enthusiastically responded to the name-signing activities. Within a short time, several tens of thousands of people signed on the banner. Afterward, the marchers held high the banner with signatures and advanced towards Jusco Department Store at China Trust Square. Several hundreds of policemen and security personnel were already posted in front of Jusco department stores. Demonstrators chanted slogans including \"Let us be united to invigorate the Chinese nation\". There were constant security personnel movements near Jusco. And anti-riot policemen arrived at the scene. Such moves caused dissatisfaction among the demonstrators. Later, the public security organs removed the anti-riot police, which helped pacify the demonstrators. On way to East Gate, the demonstrators shouted \"Boycott Japanese goods\", \"Oppose Japan's becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council\", \"Return our Diaoyu Islands\" and other slogans. They constantly received applause from bystanders. Two kimono-clad waitresses in front of a Japanese restaurant called \"Nagamori's Famous Dishes\" near Shennan Street were seen attending to customers. The move again elicited dissatisfaction among the demonstrators. They tried to rush into the restaurant but were stopped by a human wall hastily formed by public security personnel. The restaurant closed immediately. The demonstrators then proceeded to a Japanese Yakiya shop in a zone restricted for pedestrians in East Gate and asked the shop to close. When the demonstrators passed through a Japanese \"Ichiban Ramen\" restaurant, public security personnel asked the owner of the shop to switch off lights and stop doing business so as to avoid an accident. But the ramen shop reopened without waiting for all the demonstrators to leave the scene. The demonstrators returned and shouted \"Close the door! Close the door!\" Following mediation by public security personnel, the restaurant switched off lights and closed the door. The demonstrators then turned towards the Seibu Department Store near East Gate. At Seibu Department Stores near East Gate, the demonstrators asked responsible persons of the department store to come out. But the request was ignored. Later, assisted by the police, three demonstrators raised the national flag atop the Seibu Department Store. The demonstrators then marched towards Shenzhen Sports Stadium. The demonstrators arrived at the sports stadium at 1600. They dispersed peacefully after raising a national flag and chanting slogans. One of the organizers said that the demonstration would be continued next week until the goal of Japan's attempt to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council was thwarted. Today, this Ta Kung Pao reporter witnessed the whole course of the demonstration and took photos. The Shenzhen authorities did not try to stop the demonstration. But the Futian and Luohu public security bureaus had mobilized a large number of policemen to help maintain order and prevent incidents from occurring. There have been no large-scale clashes throughout the entire course of the demonstration except on two occasions when police engaged in pushing and shoving with some demonstrators who spilled onto the driveway. Commenting on this, a social science expert who did not want to reveal his name made an appeal, saying that he could understand people's anti-Japanese sentiment, and that Japan's attitude on many major historic issues had indeed made people angry, but people should be rational in their anti-Japanese activities, and they need to show understanding of some of the factors in the state's and government's handling of international diplomacy. Although voices raised by the people do reflect the real situation, state-to-state affairs are not that simple and should not be swayed by personal feelings. Sometimes, inappropriate and excessive acts by the people could, on the contrary, pose restriction to the state's handling of foreign affairs and produce a negative impact.",
        "debiased_text": "On 3 April, several websites initiated a signature campaign opposing Japan's stance on historical issues and its bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. Approximately 40,000 to 50,000 people reportedly participated in the campaign. Following the signature drive, some participants proceeded to march near Japanese-affiliated retail establishments in Shenzhen. Between 11:00 and 16:00, an estimated 4,000-5,000 demonstrators gathered outside five Japanese-operated stores. Local law enforcement personnel were present to oversee the activities. No violent incidents were reported. The demonstration route included several commercial areas in Shenzhen, including Huaqiang North Road, China Trust Square, and East Gate pedestrian zone. Participants carried banners and chanted slogans related to historical disputes between China and Japan. At several points during the demonstration, organizers requested that Japanese-affiliated businesses temporarily cease operations. Authorities mediated these requests. The event concluded at Shenzhen Sports Stadium around 16:00, where participants dispersed after a flag-raising ceremony. Organizers indicated plans for continued demonstrations in the coming weeks. Local public security departments deployed officers to monitor the events and maintain public order. Minor physical contact occurred between some participants and officers in two instances when demonstrators moved onto roadways. A social science researcher, speaking anonymously, commented on the demonstration, noting that while public sentiment on historical issues is understandable, international diplomacy requires consideration of multiple complex factors."

        "title": "Blair desperate to salvage trade liberalisation talks",
        "original_text": "Tony Blair is planning an emergency summit of the G8 nations and five leading developing countries in the new year in an attempt to give fresh impetus to flagging global trade liberalisation talks and salvage Britain's anti-poverty agenda. With Britain resigned to only modest progress at next week's meeting of the World Trade Organisation in Hong Kong, the prime minister has held preliminary talks with President Bush and President Lula of Brazil about a meeting to give a top-level political push for a final agreement in the first quarter of next year. Mr Blair had hoped to call the summit this week in a last attempt to break the deadlock between the WTO's 150 members over agriculture, market access for industrial goods and special treatment for developing countries before trade ministers begin six days of talks next Tuesday. Downing Street said it had proved logistically impossible to gather the leaders of the G8 - Britain, the US, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Russia and Japan - with the leaders of Brazil, India, South Africa, China and Mexico in the short time available. Sources insisted, however, that the prime minister had not lowered his ambitions for the round - which Britain identified as a priority for tackling global poverty in its twin presidencies of the G8 and European Union in 2005 - and that dates were being canvassed for January. Privately, both the prime minister and Gordon Brown were irritated by the decision taken by the WTO's director general, Pascal Lamy, to lower expectations for the Hong Kong meeting rather than run the risk that the gulf between developed and developing countries would prove unbridgeable and repeat the failures of meetings in Seattle in 1999 and Cancún two years ago. Mr Lamy now believes that Hong Kong should be used as a staging post to a final deal in Geneva in the first three months of next year, and WTO sources said yesterday that the talks had become more positive since the decision had been taken to \"recalibrate\" the meeting. \"You could argue that the director general has been conservative,\" the source said. \"But the downside risk was large.\" Another failure would have led to a hiatus in the talks lasting at least six months, by which time there would not have been time to complete the round before Mr Bush's fast-track mandate runs out in mid-2007. The ending of the fast-track status is seen as crucial, since it forces Congress to consider a WTO deal on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, rather than being able to accept some parts and reject others. \"There was a 25% chance of a deal but there was also a chance of a crash and burn,\" the WTO source said. \"Mr Lamy asked the members whether they were prepared to bet the whole enchilada on a 25% chance.\" Mr Blair and Mr Brown are critical of Mr Lamy's decision, believing that it would have been possible for intense diplomacy in the days leading up to Hong Kong to unfreeze the talks. The chancellor told the Treasury select committee yesterday that both Brazil and India had showed a willingness to move - on industrial tariffs and services respectively - at the meeting of G7 finance ministers (the G8 minus Russia) in London last weekend. \"The sooner this trade round is settled the better,\" Mr Brown said, adding that a successful deal could add $300bn (£170bn) to the world economy. It was important for the deal to be far-reaching, the chancellor said, because once the talks had been concluded there would not be another round for at least a decade. \"I hope even at this late stage that the trade talks can move forward.\" The fear in Downing Street, according to No 10 and Treasury sources, is that the negotiations lose all momentum after Hong Kong, and that the talks will either fizzle out or end in a limited agreement that satisfies neither developed nor developing nations. \"If we haven't been able to make real progress with all the high-level activity ahead of Hong Kong, what chance is there of speedier progress once the negotiators get back to Geneva in the New Year,\" a government source said. Britain's presidency of the EU in the second half of 2005 has meant that the prime minister has been constrained in his criticism of Europe's stance on the trade talks. Once the presidency ends, however, Mr Blair intends to argue strongly that France's determination to defend the Common Agricultural Policy should not be allowed to prevent the EU from offering the deeper cuts in farm protection being demanded by the leading developing nations as the price of a deal. Mr Blair's frustration with Mr Lamy's decision stems in part from his belief that downgrading the significance of Hong Kong has let Brussels off the hook, with the EU line on trade now almost indistinguishable from the French one.",
        "debiased_text": "Tony Blair plans to convene an emergency summit of G8 nations and five major developing countries in early 2006 to advance stalled global trade negotiations and address poverty reduction measures. The British government acknowledges limited progress is expected at the upcoming World Trade Organization meeting in Hong Kong. Blair has discussed the proposed summit with U.S. President Bush and Brazil's President Lula to seek high-level political support for reaching an agreement by Q1 2006.\n\nInitial plans to hold the summit before the Hong Kong WTO meeting were deemed logistically unfeasible for bringing together leaders of the G8 (UK, U.S., Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Russia, Japan) and representatives from Brazil, India, South Africa, China, and Mexico. Planning continues for January dates. The current trade round, identified as a UK priority during its 2005 G8 and EU presidencies, remains a focus.\n\nWTO Director General Pascal Lamy opted to reduce expectations for the Hong Kong meeting to avoid a potential breakdown similar to previous failed talks in Seattle (1999) and Cancún. Lamy views Hong Kong as preparatory for reaching a final agreement in Geneva during early 2006. WTO sources indicate negotiations have become more productive since adjusting meeting expectations, citing a 25% chance of successful outcomes versus risks of complete failure that could delay talks for six months.\n\nThe expiration of U.S. fast-track trade authority in mid-2007 creates time pressure for negotiations, as this mechanism requires Congress to consider trade agreements without amendment. UK officials, including Prime Minister Blair and Chancellor Gordon Brown, expressed concern that Lamy's approach might reduce negotiation momentum. Brown noted potential economic benefits of $300 billion from a successful agreement during recent G7 finance ministers' discussions.\n\nAs the UK concludes its EU presidency, Blair plans to advocate for increased agricultural trade concessions from the EU, despite French opposition to reforming the Common Agricultural Policy. Some officials suggest the EU's trade position has aligned closely with France's stance. UK government sources express concern about maintaining negotiation progress after the Hong Kong meeting."

        "original_text": "Michel Barnier, France's foreign minister, yesterday rebuffed US criticisms of the European Union's plans to lift its arms embargo on China saying that \"warnings or threats\" were not \"useful\" at a time when both sides were trying to improve transatlantic relations. On the eve of a visit to Washington, Mr Barnier said the EU had a different understanding of the way in which China was evolving on the international stage. \"There is a real, fundamental difference of perception that we have about China on both sides of the Atlantic,\" he said. \"One cannot treat China like Zimbabwe.\" In response to US pressure, a group of EU countries led by the UK has recently signalled a halt on plans to lift the embargo, which had been expected to be phased out during the first half of this year. British companies that had called for the ban to be lifted now expect it to remain in place until next year. Mr Barnier said China had evolved since the EU imposed the embargo in 1989, entering the World Trade Organisation and winning the right to stage the 2008 Olympic Games. It was now \"anachronistic\" to maintain the arms embargo, he said, while stressing that a strict arms export regime would continue to apply to arms sales to China. \"Our intention is at no point to multiply the sale of arms in this region. This lifting of the embargo has a political dimension,\" he said. Nevertheless, the value of EU countries' licences for arms exports to mainland China has increased from E54m in 2001 to E416m in 2003, the last year for which full figures are available. This week Robert Zoellick, deputy US secretary of state, stepped up warnings that the US Congress could respond to an end to the embargo by imposing restrictions on transatlantic defence co- operation. \"As Europe becomes a larger player on a global stage we urge it to consider some of the messages that it sends,\" he said. In response, Mr Barnier said: \"I think frankly that warnings and threats do not have any use.\" On Monday, Manfred Bischoff, co-chairman of the Franco-German group EADS, said the dispute between the EU and US risked affecting the company's business in the US. \"We are particularly keen that a solution can be found in agreement with Europe and the United States,\" he said. Mike Turner, chief executive of BAE Systems, has made clear that even if the ban were lifted, BAE would not be expanding in China. He stressed the company's position when its Pounds 2.1bn acquisition of the US United Defence Technologies was announced on March 7, amid concerns that the issue of the embargo could lead to the US government preventing the takeover. In a recent letter to British defence officials, the Society of British Aerospace Companies, the trade association, argued in favour of the embargo being lifted.",
        "debiased_text": "French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier addressed US criticisms regarding the European Union's proposed lifting of its arms embargo on China, stating that 'warnings or threats' were not productive during efforts to improve transatlantic relations. Speaking ahead of a visit to Washington, Barnier noted differing EU and US perspectives on China's role internationally. He emphasized that China should not be treated like Zimbabwe and highlighted China's evolution since the embargo was imposed in 1989, including its WTO accession and hosting the 2008 Olympics. Barnier described maintaining the embargo as outdated but confirmed that strict arms export controls would remain for sales to China. He clarified that the EU did not intend to increase arms sales to the region, framing the potential lifting of the embargo as a political decision. EU arms export licenses to China rose from €54 million in 2001 to €416 million in 2003, the latest year with complete data. US Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick warned that Congress might restrict transatlantic defense cooperation if the EU lifted the embargo, urging Europe to consider its messaging. Barnier reiterated that warnings were unhelpful. Meanwhile, EADS co-chairman Manfred Bischoff expressed concerns that the EU-US dispute could impact the company's US operations. BAE Systems CEO Mike Turner stated the company would not expand in China even if the embargo ended, reinforcing this stance during a £2.1 billion acquisition of US-based United Defense Technologies. The Society of British Aerospace Companies has advocated for lifting the embargo in correspondence with UK defense officials."

        "original_text": "As British universities scrambled to take advantage of Tony Blair's visit to Beijing to raise their own profiles, Amnesty International has warned of continuing human rights abuses in China. In a briefing for the European Union-China summit this week, Amnesty pointed to continuing harsh treatment of people involved in the 1989 pro-democracy Tiananmen Square protests and to the recent clampdown on the press and internet. But Mr Blair, whose government holds the rotating EU presidency, said today, after his talks with Chinese leaders, that he is optimistic China will improve its rights record. \"In a country that is developing very fast ... there is unstoppable momentum there toward greater political freedom, progress on human rights,\" he said. Amnesty reported that 16 years after the military crackdown in Tiananmen Square, dozens of individuals remain in prison, or have been exiled from their homeland, unable to return even to see elderly or sick parents. The briefing to the EU added: \"Contrary to earlier hopes that the Hu Jintao/Wen Jiabao administration would relax controls over the press, investigative reporting, the internet, radio and other forms of broadcasting, the trend has been towards a restriction of freedoms including even retrenchments in areas where citizens had earlier enjoyed freedoms, such as on private blogs on the internet. \"In the last six months the authorities have added new legal, technological, and political means of monitoring, controlling and restricting the flow of information and expression in various media. The spate of recent detentions and sentencing of individuals - based on vaguely worded charges including \"illegally leaking state secrets\", \"disturbing social order\", \"subversion\" and \"defamation\", among others - for the peaceful exercise of their right to free expression sends a clear message to the citizenry of China of the risks they run in exercising their rights. The British prime minister today used a broadcast for Chinese television to highlight the £20m campus built by Nottingham University at Ningbo in collaboration with the Chinese authorities. In the invited audience were Nottingham's vice-chancellor, Sir Colin Campbell, and the Ningbo university's chancellor, Professor Fujia Yang. Nottingham's venture is in partnership with Zhejiang Wanli University and has been operating in temporary accommodation for the past year. Later this month the new campus, with facilities for 4,000 students, opens its doors. This is the biggest of a growing number of partnerships with Chinese universities and colleges established by British universities, although they lag behind the US, Australia, Canada and Japan, according to the London-based Observatory on Borderless Education. Partnerships greatly exceed the numbers officially reported, so the involvement of British universities is probably underestimated, but the number of students on UK programmes in China nearly doubled to 2,554 between 2002 and 2003 at a time when numbers coming to the UK to study were also booming. The recent drop in the numbers coming from China to the UK has alarmed universities, which have become dependent on their fees, and will prompt greater efforts to set up programmes and partnerships within China to tap the massive demand for higher education. Business courses, particularly MBAs, lead the field and appear to be becoming more specialised as universities try to differentiate themselves in a crowded market, says the Observatory. The other subjects in demand are IT, education, English language and law.",
        "debiased_text": "During Tony Blair's visit to Beijing, British universities sought to raise their profiles while Amnesty International issued a briefing regarding human rights in China for the EU-China summit. The briefing noted ongoing legal cases related to individuals involved in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and reported increased restrictions on press freedom and internet usage under the current administration.\n\nAt the same meeting, Blair, whose government holds the rotating EU presidency, stated he believes China will show progress in human rights. 'In a rapidly developing country, there is momentum toward greater political freedom and human rights advancements,' he said.\n\nAmnesty International reported that some individuals connected to the Tiananmen Square events remain imprisoned or exiled 16 years later. The briefing also mentioned recent legal and technological measures implemented by Chinese authorities to monitor and control information across various media platforms, including cases where individuals were detained or sentenced on charges such as 'illegally leaking state secrets' and 'disturbing social order.'\n\nSeparately, Blair highlighted a £20m campus in Ningbo, a joint project between the University of Nottingham and Chinese authorities. The new campus, set to open soon, will accommodate 4,000 students. According to the Observatory on Borderless Education, British universities are expanding partnerships in China, though they trail behind the U.S., Australia, Canada, and Japan in such collaborations. Enrollment in UK-linked programs in China rose significantly from 2002 to 2003.\n\nRecent declines in Chinese student enrollment in UK universities have prompted institutions to increase efforts in establishing programs within China. Business courses, especially MBAs, are the most sought-after, followed by IT, education, English language, and law programs."

But outside the Spar supermarket, 16-year-old Cara Jones and five of her mates stand in the glow of the shop's strip-lights and swap cigarettes, text messages and gossip. They usually meet here or at the Strand, the intersection a few yards down the street. Not much happens at either. To a teenager, this former mining village in the Rhondda Fach valley can feel like the end of the earth. \"It's boring!\" says Jones, to the universal agreement of her tracksuited gang. \"There's nowhere to go.\" Ferndale, population 4,400, may seem wholly unremarkable to its youth, but it is leading the nation in one respect at least: the cost of its housing. Research published last week suggested that the average price paid for a house in Ferndale in the past five years was just £29,700, making it the most inexpensive property spot in Britain. The news came as a shock to Ferndale residents. Property prices have shot up here in recent years as the buoyant Cardiff market has forced first-time buyers to look further afield. An influx of cashed-up English investors looking for cheap buy-to-let properties in the valleys added fuel to the flames. Nowadays, a renovated house in Ferndale will sell for £60,000 or more. But mouseprice.com, which bases its research on sales data provided by the Land Registry, is sticking by its figures. \"Our analysis is very careful,\" says director Selwyn Lim. \"Ferndale is without a doubt still the cheapest place to buy a home.\" In his barber's shop on High Street, Gary Beach sweeps up the remains of another £3.40 haircut and ponders life in the nation's cheapest village. The 54-year-old has been running his electric clippers over Ferndale scalps for 19 years and is known locally as Golden Blades. His goatee and earring are a reminder of his days playing bass in local rock groups that changed their names as often as the Welsh weather, for \"social security reasons\". Beach brushes a clump of grey hair off his faded Puma sweatshirt and leans on his broom. \"People think the valleys are all sheep, coal mines and male voice choirs,\" he says. \"But there's a lot more to it than that.\" What exactly? \"Well, there's a great sense of community,\" he says. \"And outsiders notice a friendliness which I put down to our curiosity.\" Ferndale is hardly a Welsh idyll, however. Local jobs and amenities are scarce and people can feel trapped between the steep valley cliffs that rise dramatically on either side of the stone cottages. In some ways, Beach is one of them. He was born and raised just five miles from Ferndale and admits he used to dream about retiring to the coast. That is unlikely now because of the gulf between property prices in the village and the rest of the country. His future is likely to remain in Ferndale, with his wife and kids and friends at the rugby club and the Cor Meibion Morlais male voice choir. \"I'm doing all right,\" he says with a shrug. \"I'm not a rich man, but I do everything I like doing.\" At 7.6%, Ferndale's unemployment rate is a third higher than the national average (a further 520 of the village's 2,633 working-age adults claim incapacity benefit or disability living allowance). When Chubb switches production of fire extinguishers to China this summer, the area will lose a further 154 jobs and one of its few remaining large-scale employers. For many residents, indeed, commuting is already a way of life. Each morning, a sizeable portion of Ferndale's workforce heads south on the A4233 to jobs in larger centres such as Pontypridd and Cardiff. A few journey even further to Bristol, Gloucester and London. A car is essential because the trains have not run this far up the valley since the 1960s, though the 20-mile trip to Cardiff can take an hour and a half on the valley's narrow, congested roads. At the Arts Factory, an elegantly converted chapel at the centre of the village, Elwyn James is doing his best to break what he calls a \"culture of dependence\" in the Rhondda. The 40-year-old moved here from north London in 1989 and is now the chief executive of a community centre operating graphic and environmental design businesses and offering classes in everything from yoga and watercolour painting to internet skills and digital photography. With his black biker jacket and shaved head, James looks and sounds like an outsider; in fact his father was born here and his determination to build a stronger community is almost evangelical. Ferndale is a great place to live, he says. It's friendly and affordable and there are \"no middle-class people ramming their affluence down your throat\". James says he understands why some Fern-dale teenagers are reduced to hanging around on street corners, and some turn to alcohol or drugs - they are bored by traditional village facilities such as rugby clubs and boys' clubs. \"If I had been a teenager here I would have been bored to death to be honest,\" he says. The Arts Factory has a database of 1,300 people who have signed up to use its facilities, but its approach to \"upskilling\" the community does not please everyone. Its most radical plan - to build a £10m, eight-turbine wind farm on the ridge above Ferndale - has met with fierce resistance. Opponents say the farm will be an eyesore in a valley that has already been brutally scarred by the coal industry. They question how many local jobs will be created and are sceptical as to whether revenue from the sale of power will flow into the community. James is unrepentant. \"Sometimes these communities can be very conservative.\" Life has never been easy in Ferndale. The first pit was sunk here in 1857; the original settlement was a collection of crude wooden cabins built to house 800 miners. In 1867, a devastating explosion at the mine killed 178 men and boys. Two years later, a second blast killed 50. For a while, Ferndale had a sombre reputation as a place of death. Economics prevailed over sentiment, however, and coal production increased substantially in the 1870s. The colliery built the long terraces of stone cottages that now represent the country's cheapest housing. Most have been renovated internally, but apart from the addition of satellite dishes, their Welsh stone exteriors are largely unchanged. Maerdy, the last working pit in the Rhondda, closed in 1989. Since then, nature has been healing the valley's scars. Slagheaps have turned green, and rivers that once ran black with coal dust are clean and stocked with fish. Locals talk with excitement about sightings of herons, kingfishers and peregrine falcons. \"The valleys are green again,\" says Beach. \"They're beautiful.\" Unfortunately, Ferndale's economic recovery has proved more sluggish. Locals say there used to be about 100 shops in the village; now there are about 30. A new Chinese takeaway is opening to compete with the Happy Wok, the King Balti Indian takeaway and Margaritelli's fish and chip shop, but this is a rare happening. It takes guts to start a new business here, as Debbie Evans discovered when she opened the Sun House tanning salon two years ago. The building's bright red facade stands out like a beacon against the sea of grey stone and pebbledash, but it has been a struggle to coax villagers inside. Evans, who is 38 and sports what appears to be one of Ferndale's few suntans, charges £2.50 for a three-minute session, but admits business can be slow, particularly in the winter months. Her clientele ranges from young mothers wanting a break from their children to elderly people seeking relief from arthritis and psoriasis. \"I've been told I'm the cheapest suntan shop in the valley,\" she says. \"But you can't charge what people are charging in Cardiff. People won't pay it.\" She considered shutting up shop last winter, but is determined to make a go of it. She loves living and working in the area and is confident that her two teenage children will stay here too, despite the challenges of low employment and rising property prices. And if they do, they will not be so very unusual. There is little migration to Ferndale - 99.6% of population is white - and there is some brain-drain among graduates. But overall, the village's young people are not moving away in droves, despite the protestations of the teenagers hanging out at Spar and the Strand. Wayne Fraser is 53. His father worked down the Maerdy pit for 40 years, but would not allow his son to join him. Fraser joined the Royal Navy instead, but returned to Ferndale; he says many locals find it difficult to stay away. \"I call the Welsh valleys a clinging society,\" says Fraser, who helps run the Arts Factory and also works as a physiotherapist at the rugby club. \"People don't tend to leave. Even the kids aren't moving away. I know some that have gone to Oxford or Cambridge and still come back to the area.\" There is strong sense of community, of course. You can find it in obvious places like the Welsh-language school or at the Tuesday-night rehearsal of the male voice choir. But it is also evident in the pubs and clubs, where retired miners sit side by side with teenagers and babies. At the Imperial Conservative working man's club, where a half-pint of Fosters costs 86p, the atmosphere resembles a family gathering. A toddler races across the room to the deafening sound of the Beastie Boys playing on the jukebox. In places like this, there are few secrets. Robert Bevan, a councillor for the nearby village of Tylorstown, lives in a house that was built for his great-great-grandfather in 1897 when he moved to the village to work in the No 9 pit.\"We're fiercely proud,\" says Bevan. \"Being born here and living here is something special. We've got a great way of making people feel welcome, but also bringing people back down to earth.\" It is a sentiment shared by Wayne Harris, the landlord of Ferndale's Anchor hotel, though he struggles to explain the locals' devotion. \"Perhaps it's just something we're born with,\" he says. \"I've worked all over Britain, but I always think, no matter how nice it is, home is always better.\" He glances through the window at the rainclouds that are still hanging low over the steep cliffs surrounding the village. \"Then again, it pisses down half the time, and the other half it snows. So why the fuck we like it so much I'm not sure.\"",
        "debiased_text": "The evening rain continues in Ferndale, where terraced houses line the main street. Few people are outside, with most indoors for the evening. Outside a local supermarket, a group of teenagers gathers regularly to socialize. Recent research indicates Ferndale has the lowest average house prices in Britain at £29,700 over the past five years, though renovated properties now sell for around £60,000. The figures come from mouseprice.com, which uses Land Registry data. Local barber Gary Beach, who has worked in Ferndale for 19 years, comments on community life in the village. Unemployment in Ferndale stands at 7.6%, higher than the national average. The upcoming closure of a Chubb fire extinguisher factory will result in 154 job losses. Many residents commute to larger towns for work, with Cardiff being a common destination about 20 miles away. The Arts Factory, a converted chapel, operates as a community center offering various classes and workshops. Plans for a wind farm above the village have faced opposition. Ferndale's history includes coal mining dating back to 1857, with two major mining accidents in the 1860s resulting in significant loss of life. The last local mine closed in 1989. New businesses in the village face challenges, with one tanning salon owner noting difficulties attracting customers. Population statistics show 99.6% of residents are white, with limited migration into the area. Many residents express strong ties to the community, including those who have left for education but later returned. Local establishments like pubs and clubs serve as gathering places for residents of all ages."

        "title": "Belarus leader tightens grip in run-up to March poll",
        "original_text": "Belarus set March 19 as the date for presidential elections yesterday, ushering in three tense months of renewed political oppression to prevent any protest-led revolution in the authoritarian republic. The Belarussian parliament, broadly obedient to President Alexander Lukashenko, voted unanimously to set the date a full six months before he finishes his second term. The United States has branded Mr Lukashenko \"Europe's last dictator\", while the European Union has considered sanctions to get him to loosen his tight grip on the country's economy, politics and society. The announcement came a day after he met his key ally, President Vladimir Putin of Russia, at Sochi on the Black Sea. The meeting was closed to the press, but the Kremlin said \"energy cooperation\" was high on the agenda. Diplomats said the meeting may have been used to secure Russian economic and geopolitical support for Mr Lukashenko's re-election. \"It looks like Putin will support him,\" said a senior western diplomat, who had been expecting the poll to be held in July. Since the recent protest-led revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan, Belarus has tightened its already strict censorship and Soviet-era controls. Parliament passed a law this month that punishes \"distributing false information about Belarus\" with up to to three years in jail. The opposition press has been partly shut down and some of its journalists have died in mysterious circumstances. The Polish media have reported that Mr Lukashenko has ordered internet-censoring equipment from China. The early election is one of the most keenly awaited in the former Soviet Union. Neighbouring Poland and the Baltic states have joined the EU and begun exerting pressure on Mr Lukashenko. Warsaw briefly withdrew its ambassador for three months this year after ethnic Poles were allegedly harassed in Belarus. Mr Putin has toyed with the idea of uniting Russia and Belarus and installing himself as president-in-chief, thereby extending his rule. But his apparent desire to step down in 2008 has frozen this plan. Diplomats believe that Thursday's meeting may have been used to secure cheap gas and oil for Belarus, preventing any economic upset in the near future. \"Economic problems would be the spark for any unrest,\" said one western diplomat, adding that such a prospect looked unlikely now. About 80% of the economy is controlled by the state, and its relative prosperity remains a key factor in mollifying the electorate. The diplomat said the ongoing crackdown was \"probably due to classic Soviet paranoia\". The opposition, often dismissed because of its internal squabbling, has united behind Alexander Milinkevich, 58, a professor. Barred from the state-controlled media, he is trying to drum up support by touring the country, promoting his image as a dissident. He told the Guardian by telephone that \"a large number of people in Belarus want change\". He said: \"We were ready [for an early vote]. The authorities are afraid of elections as my ratings are rising fast. The people in the country understand that the authorities are not sure of themselves and know they would lose the elections if they were held honestly.\" Backstory President Alexander Lukashenko, 51, was elected in 1994. He is a former Soviet hardliner, and as an MP supported the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev. Since his election, he has extended his first term by two years with a 1996 referendum, and last year used another plebiscite to remove the limit of two presidential terms. According to official results, he won at least 70% in all three votes, none of which was recognised as democratic. Tensions over his authoritarian style have risen as neighbouring Poland and the Baltic states have joined the EU, and Ukraine underwent protest-led regime change last year. Russia has sought to increase its influence by bolstering the economy with cheap fuel supplies.",
        "debiased_text": "Belarus has set March 19 as the date for its upcoming presidential elections. The decision was made by the Belarussian parliament, which voted unanimously to schedule the vote six months before President Alexander Lukashenko's current term concludes. The announcement followed a meeting between Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi. The Kremlin stated that energy cooperation was discussed, though the meeting was not open to the press. Diplomatic sources suggest the talks may have included discussions on Russian support for Belarus ahead of the elections. The election date comes amid recent legislative changes in Belarus, including a new law imposing penalties of up to three years for distributing what is deemed false information about the country. Some opposition media outlets have faced restrictions, and reports indicate Belarus has acquired internet-censoring equipment from China. Poland temporarily recalled its ambassador earlier this year following allegations of harassment against ethnic Poles in Belarus. Alexander Milinkevich, a 58-year-old professor, has emerged as a unified opposition candidate. He claims growing public support for political change and has been campaigning outside state-controlled media channels. Official results from Lukashenko's previous elections, including a 1996 term extension and a 2004 referendum eliminating presidential term limits, reported over 70% approval, though these were not recognized as democratic by international observers. Belarus maintains significant state control over its economy, with approximately 80% under government management. Russia has provided economic support to Belarus through subsidized energy supplies."

        "title": "The company that offers national calls for just 1p",
        "original_text": "Unless you regularly monitor internet chat rooms on the subject, it is highly unlikely that you have heard of Call18866. This is a company that doesn't advertise itself and is impossible to contact by phone. It is also offering what are almost certainly the cheapest phone call prices and is one of the few utility companies that is praised by many of its 5,000 happy customers in the UK. Call18866 came to our attention after Jobs &amp; Money ran an article comparing the cost of telecom companies. A few readers contacted us to point out that this company was the cheapest they have found - all said they were very happy with the service and absolutely delighted by its prices. The chief drawback is that little is known about the company, which is based in Switzerland. Call18866 is available to anyone with a phone line and is accessed by dialling - you guessed it - 18866, followed by the number you want to call. You carry on paying your line rental to BT or your network provider, but they will make no charge for the calls you make. Once connected to 18866, you will be charged just 1p; an automated voice will then say how much the rest of the call will cost per minute. If the call is national or local then it is free. You only pay the 1p connection fee. International calls are perhaps the cheapest available to UK domestic customers. Calls to the US, China and most European countries cost 2p per minute, and call charges to UK and foreign mobiles are much lower than BT and other phone providers. In all cases calls are billed by the second and rounded up to the nearest penny. Prices include VAT. Even compared with the host of other low-cost entrants to the telecoms market, we found that 18866's tariffs were better value - unless you have an exceptional phone usage pattern. To access the service, you have to register at the company's website, listing up to 10 phone numbers you wish to call from, and hand over your credit card details. Once the amount owed reaches around £1.20 it will be debited to your card. Customers can at any time log on to www.call18866.co.uk/ to see their virtual itemised bill, which is also periodically emailed to you. Jim Woodward-Nutt, who lives in Pulborough, West Sussex, is one happy Call18866 customer. He has been using the service for nearly a year. The retired broadcast engineer, who has tried several low-cost providers, says 18866 offers the lowest call charges he has found. \"The call prices are truly exceptional and I have seen my phone bills drop dramatically - the only downside that I have found is that you have to remember to dial the number as the firm does not offer carrier pre-select or dialler boxes. \"I've only had two calls that failed to connect properly - to Yorkshire of all places; the rest of the time it's been very good,\" he said. In the face of so many tributes, J&amp;M emailed the firm to ask to talk to a spokesman about the company behind the operation. We received a standard response saying the company does not have a call centre - there is no number you can ring - although our email was answered very promptly. It is, we discovered, impossible to call the firm as it does not publish any phone numbers on its website or employ any staff to take calls. All questions or queries about bills have to be sent by email. There are a few other downsides. The account needs to be set up and managed online, although anyone without a computer could ask a friend to do this on their behalf. Having to dial the num ber is a drag, although some phones will let it be recorded on a speed dial button. Cable customers will need stronger fingers as they have to call a different, longer, number. The company cannot deal with customers who have an AOL email account, after AOL blocked their emails after receiving complaints about spam. The other main downside is that you have to give your card number to an unknown organisation - and in this case it is always advisable to use a credit rather than debit card, as you get a certain level of consumer protection. Who runs 18866? Little is known about the company behind 18866, Finarea SA, except that it runs a similar service in Switzerland, where it is based. It is planning similar operations across Europe. The government regulator Ofcom holds no information on the firm at all. Under 18866's terms and conditions the company retains the right to vary its charges and halt the service with 30 days' notice. Slightly alarmingly, it says 18866 may pass its customers' details on to other parties as part of its business activities. No opt-out from this is offered. So, is the pricing structure sustainable? Its pared-down operation has been likened to the low-cost airlines -although its customers appear much happier. It is also questionable whether it can deal with large numbers of customers, which might explain why it has not advertised. Ultimately, if it all goes wrong customers can simply stop dialling 18866 and go back to using their former network provider.",
        "debiased_text": "Call18866 is a telecommunications service provider operating in the UK. The company, based in Switzerland, does not advertise extensively and cannot be contacted by phone. It serves approximately 5,000 customers in the UK. The service came to attention following a price comparison of telecom companies, with some readers identifying Call18866 as offering competitive pricing. To use the service, customers must dial 18866 before entering their desired number. Line rental charges from existing providers still apply. Calls through Call18866 incur a 1p connection fee, followed by automated details about per-minute costs. National and local calls are free after the connection fee. International call rates are 2p per minute to destinations including the US, China, and most European countries. Call charges to UK and foreign mobile numbers are lower than those offered by BT and other providers. Calls are billed by the second and rounded up to the nearest penny, with VAT included.

Call records are accessible online and emailed periodically. Some customers, including Jim Woodward-Nutt from West Sussex, report lower call costs compared to other providers. Woodward-Nutt noted the need to dial 18866 manually as a drawback, citing rare connection issues. Call18866 does not operate a call center, and inquiries must be made via email. The service requires online account management, which may pose challenges for those without internet access. Cable users must dial a longer number. AOL email accounts are incompatible due to past spam complaints. Customers must provide card details, with credit cards recommended for additional protection. The company behind Call18866, Finarea SA, also operates in Switzerland and plans expansions in Europe. Ofcom holds no records on the firm. Call18866 reserves the right to adjust pricing and terminate service with 30 days' notice. Customer details may be shared with third parties as part of business operations, with no opt-out option. The company’s minimal operating model has been compared to low-cost airlines. Its ability to scale remains untested, which may explain limited marketing. Customers can discontinue using the service at any time."

        "original_text": "Two senior Chinese bank executives have made a provocative public call for the role of the ruling Communist party in financial institutions to be curbed. The chairman of China Construction Bank and the largest shareholder of the country's largest property lender describe in an interview in Caijing, a financial magazine, how CCB's board has operated in the shadow of a party-controlled committee inside the bank. The comments were made by Xie Ping, who heads Central Huijin Investment, a majority shareholder in two of the big four state banks now preparing for overseas listings. They were supported by Guo Shuqing, recently appointed chairman of China Construction Bank following the resignation in March of Zhang Enzhao under a cloud of scandal. Under Mr Zhang's chairmanship, the party committee held \"dozens of meetings\", Huijin executives said, and even debated decisions over small loans. The board, by contrast, met rarely and reported to the party committee. Mr Xie and Mr Guo said that such a structure was \"contrary to CCB's corporate bylaws\" and would change under the new leadership team. Mr Guo has taken charge of CCB as it is wooing strategic foreign investors ahead of a planned initial public offering overseas. The bank has been marketing itself to foreign investors as a largely restructured organisation with an active board, including three independent directors. In the Caijing interview, Mr Xie, Mr Guo and officials of Huijin, describe how CCB's board has operated in the shadow of a second committee inside the bank, controlled by the party. State-owned Chinese companies always have party committees, but their roles are rarely discussed in public and their power over management decisions is almost never acknowledged. Mr Guo is both the party secretary and the chairman of CCB. The party committee consists mainly of bank executives and officials from related companies. \"The principle is clear - a check and balance between the party and the policy-making body has to be established,\" he said. Mr Xie also criticised the almost total control over senior personnel appointments maintained by the party's organisation department. Their criticism of the party's role in a commercial organisation was applauded by academics. Wang Songqi, vice-director of the Institute of Finance and Banking at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said: \"The party should only play the role of giving ideological education to maintain the organisation's vigor, leaving daily operations and supervision to the board of directors.\"",

All of which makes Steve Bruce look goofier than Rio Ferdinand on stilts. Bruce, you will recall, is the man who three years ago gave Johnson plus £3.5m to Palace in return for Clinton Morrison. Undeterred by that piece of commercial nonsense, however, the bold Bruce is about to bound back into the transfer market, this time to bag Greek Euro 2004 champion Giorgos Karagounis from Inter and troublesome never-won-anything midfielder Lee Bowyer from Newcastle. Meanwhile, the team soon to be known as Premiership Strugglers West Ham are getting ideas above their station and are trying to convince themselves that they're on the verge of landing Dutch predator-a-like Edgar Davids. Of course, when it comes to cultivating fantasies, Real Madrid are the undisputed world leaders. Along with the The Sun. How fitting, then, that it is the latter that trumpets today that the former is about to splurge £110m on - wait for it - Thierry Henry, Cristiano Ronaldo, Steven Gerrard, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Jose Reyes. No doubt once they've pulled of those little coups, the galacticos will line up bids for Coca Cola, the Great Wall of China and Uranus. All of which makes reports that Lyon are going to buy Benoit Pedretti from Marseille decidedly underwhelming. While Celtic's swoop for Wisla Krakow striker Maciej Zurawksi and Middlesbrough's interest in Bayer Leverkusen defender Emanuel Pogatez are totally insignificant beer by comparison. So instead, let's conclude with the latest instalment in Sir Alex Ferguson's laughable ongoing attempt to find a long-term replacement for Roy Keane: River Plate's Javier Mascherano is the man in the frame this time, and given Fergie's well-documented success when it comes to bringing the best out of South American imports - yes you Seba Veron, yes you Kleberson, yes you, Diego Forlan - it's hardly a surprise.",

        "original_text": "China may overtake Japan as the biggest customer for BHP Billiton Ltd. this year, Chief Executive Chip Goodyear said. He said resistance in China to an attempt by BHP to double iron-ore prices hadn't caused lasting damage to the company's business operations in China. Mr. Goodyear predicted that sales to China in the year ending June 30 would reach $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion, more than quintuple the $600 million in fiscal 2002. That would be greater than sales to any other single country; sales to the European Union as a whole are greater than those to China. Although the Melbourne, Australia, miner is becoming increasingly reliant on the Chinese economy, which is plagued by boom-bust cycles, Mr. Goodyear said this reliance wouldn't lead to destabilizing ups and downs in revenue. The company was well protected by its diversification across regions and commodities, by long-term contracts and low operating costs, he said. Separately, BHP, worried about rising construction costs, confirmed yesterday that it will proceed with a $2.7 billion iron-ore expansion project in stages, delaying full production by at least a year. BHP expects to announce the first phase of the so-called Long Term expansion in the 2005 fourth quarter following board and government approvals, said Ian Ashby, president of BHP's Western Australia iron-ore operations.",

He projected sales to China in the fiscal year ending June 30 would total between $3.2 billion and $3.3 billion, a significant increase from the $600 million recorded in fiscal 2002. This figure would surpass sales to any other individual country, though sales to the entire European Union remain higher than those to China. Goodyear noted that while BHP's reliance on China's economy is growing, the company's revenue stability is safeguarded by diversification across regions and commodities, long-term contracts, and low operating costs. In a separate announcement, BHP confirmed it will proceed with a $2.7 billion iron-ore expansion project in phases due to rising construction costs, delaying full production by at least one year. Ian Ashby, president of BHP's Western Australia iron-ore operations, stated that the first phase of the Long Term expansion is expected to be announced in the fourth quarter of 2005, pending board and government approvals."

        "title": "Chinese Capital Bans Live Poultry In Bird-Flu Fight; Chinese Capital Bans Live Poultry In Bird-Flu Fight",
        "original_text": "BEIJING -- China sharply stepped up its efforts to contain avian influenza, effectively banning live poultry from its capital city just a day after completing a massive culling of domesticated bird flocks in the country's northeast. Health officials in Beijing, which so far hasn't reported any infected birds, yesterday ordered all live-poultry markets to close and said people were barred from raising chickens in the capital's downtown districts and from bringing in live poultry from outside the city, state-run media reported. Officials in at least one other so-far unaffected city took similar precautions, the reports said. Those measures came after officials exterminated some six million chickens and other poultry during the weekend in the northeastern province of Liaoning, site of China's latest bird-flu outbreak. The government's moves are aimed at checking the spread of a lethal avian flu that has affected birds in four Chinese provinces since mid- October. The disease's advance is raising concerns about possible human infections in China and is inflicting significant damage to the country's large poultry industry. Poultry-industry executives said consumers increasingly are shunning chicken and duck meat, long dietary staples in China. They said poultry prices have plunged as much as 60% in recent weeks amid a collapse in demand, even in provinces that haven't had an avian-flu outbreak. Bird farming is an immense business in China, home to 14.2 billion domestic fowls, or 20% of the world's total, according to Chinese statistics. Animal husbandry accounted for 1.2 trillion yuan, or about $148 billion, of national output last year -- 8.9% of China's gross domestic product. Agriculture officials say poultry accounts for about 33% of that share. China so far has avoided any confirmed human cases of bird flu, although health officials said during the weekend that the virus might have killed a girl and infected two others in the southern province of Hunan last month. China has asked the World Health Organization to help investigate those cases. World-wide, bird flu has infected more than 120 people -- all in Asia -- and about half of them have died. Scientists worry that the virus could mutate into a form easily transmitted between humans, possibly causing a global pandemic. In Geneva yesterday, WHO began hosting a three-day conference aimed at coordinating global efforts to stave off or limit a possible pandemic. More than 300 scientists, health experts and government officials are taking part. \"It is only a matter of time before an avian-flu virus, most likely H5N1, acquires the ability to be transmitted from human to human, sparking the outbreak of human pandemic influenza,\" WHO Director- General Lee Jong-Wook said, according to the Associated Press. The United Nations' top coordinator for avian and human influenza, David Nabarro, told Reuters that the gathering is expected to produce a plan of attack ranging from investment in veterinary services to improved human-disease surveillance and vaccine development. He said the World Bank will propose a fund for these purposes, built by donor nations. Chinese poultry-industry executives said they already are feeling the pain. \"Everybody is afraid of chicken now,\" said Chen Yongping, a sales manager at Huayuan Poultry Industry Group in the central province of Anhui. \"Even though we're selling at prices below our costs, nobody wants it.\" --- Cui Rong and Zhou Yang contributed to this article. ---",
        "debiased_text": "BEIJING — China has implemented additional measures to control avian influenza, including a prohibition on live poultry in Beijing following the culling of approximately six million domesticated birds in Liaoning province, where the country's latest bird-flu outbreak occurred. Beijing health officials ordered the closure of live-poultry markets and restricted the raising of chickens in urban districts, as well as the transportation of live poultry into the city, according to state media reports. Similar actions were taken in at least one other unaffected city. Since mid-October, avian flu has been detected in birds across four provinces. Concerns have been raised about potential human infections and economic losses to China's poultry industry. Industry reports indicate declining demand for poultry products, with prices dropping as much as 60% in recent weeks, even in areas without reported outbreaks. China’s domestic fowl population stands at 14.2 billion, accounting for 20% of the global total, with poultry contributing approximately 33% of the 1.2 trillion yuan ($148 billion) livestock sector, which represents 8.9% of the nation’s GDP. No confirmed human cases of bird flu have been reported in China, though officials are investigating possible infections in Hunan province. Globally, avian flu has infected over 120 people in Asia, with a fatality rate near 50%. The World Health Organization (WHO) is convening a three-day conference in Geneva to discuss pandemic preparedness, with participation from over 300 scientists and officials. WHO Director-General Lee Jong-Wook stated that the potential for human-to-human transmission of an avian-flu virus, likely H5N1, remains a concern. UN avian-influenza coordinator David Nabarro confirmed discussions on a coordinated response, including veterinary investments, disease surveillance, and vaccine development. Chinese poultry industry representatives report significant financial losses due to reduced demand. Cui Rong and Zhou Yang contributed to this report."

        "title": "How 10 quadrillion sums a second will make computer the world's fastest",
        "original_text": "In the world of computers, it promises to be the biggest, fastest, and most mindboggling, of them all. Officials in Japan yesterday announced that they intend to build a supercomputer that will operate 73 times faster than the current top computer. Number one at the moment is IBM's Blue Gene computer, in California, capable of handling 136.8 trillion mathematical calculations a second, or 136.8 teraflops. The Japanese machine, which could cost up to $900m, (about £515m) would leave it standing. Japanese media reports said officials at the country's education and science ministry were aiming to develop a machine that could operate at 10 petaflops, or 10 quadrillion calculations a second. A computer that large needs tough challenges, and there are several being lined up for it. In addition to tracking climate changes, this brute of a computer will be used to simulate the formation of the galaxy and to gauge human reactions to new drugs. If all goes to plan, the machine will be up and running by March 2011. Scientists rely on supercomputers, operating at what are barely comprehensible speeds, to conduct experiments - which are often simulations - that would take too long if standard hardware were used. While the US is developing supercomputers to conduct nuclear weapons tests without the need to detonate an actual device, Japan is using the technology to track sea temperatures and rainfall in the hope of more accurately predicting natural disasters such as the fierce, and occasionally deadly, typhoons that sweep across the archipelago during the course of every summer and autumn. China, with a cautious eye on its neighbour, is developing a system with a top speed of 100 teraflops. Beijing, which regards supercomputers as vital to its competitive credentials, has 19 machines in the top 500. Though it lags behind the US, Germany, Japan and Britain, China is the fastest-growing supercomputing market in Asia. Japan's Earth Simulator, which occupies a space equivalent to four tennis courts, and is installed at the Earth Simulator Research and Development Centre, in Yokohama, was the fastest supercomputer in the world until it was overtaken by IBM's Blue Gene in 2004. US machines currently occupy the top three slots in the global ranking of supercomputers, according to a list released last month at the international supercomputing conference, held in Heidelberg, Germany. The machines are powered by racks of thousands of processors, which, ironically, give them the unwieldy look of the very first computers. Top of the flops For computers, speed is everything. Speed is measured in \"flops\" - floating point operations per second, or the number of calculations a machine can complete in a second. Back in the 1970s, when the first supercomputers were being built, machines could achieve speeds of several million flops. Since then, computers, even home PCs, have raised their speeds at an astonishing rate. Most home computers now achieve speeds of several billion flops. But this pales in comparison to today's fastest supercomputers, such as IBM's Blue Gene. With 10 petaflops, this new computer, to be built in Japan, could operate at 10 quadrillion calculations a second (a quadrillion is 1,000 million million). Flop size is important for complex scientific calculations but is also becoming increasingly significant elsewhere. Animation studios - such as the studio Pixar with its movies Toy Story and The Incredibles - are using powerful computers for films. Even the graphics on video games consoles will soon demand high flop levels. The next generation of Sony's PlayStation, due next year, is expected to compute at about two teraflops: that might be 5,000 times slower than Japan's proposed machine, but it's more than enough for most of us.

        "title": "The illegal meat trade that can bring a deadly virus to our high streets",
        "original_text": "DR YUNES TEINAZ is a dead man walking. At least that is what his enemies say. Teinaz, a big man with a big mouth, has a £100,000 bounty on his head as a result of his outspoken attacks on criminal gangs. The gangs who Teinaz, a chartered environmental health practitioner and an adviser to the director-general of the Islamic Cultural Centre, has fallen foul of are not involved in prostitution, drugs or guns: they sell meat. Illegally. Teinaz received the death threat three years ago after helping to prosecute a gang involved in the production of 'smokies' - sheep carcasses blow-torched to give them a distinctive charred texture (in breach of food safety regulations) which are sold to Nigerian communities who consider it a delicacy. Teinaz's then boss was also offered £20,000 to sack him. The death threat has never been lifted. The black-market trade is worth an estimated £1 billion a year, according to Teinaz, and it shows no signs of slowing down. New statistics, soon to be released by Customs and Excise, will show that seizures continue to increase. 'The problem of illegal meat smuggling is increasing, but many local authorities lack the resources and the expertise to deal with it,' Teinaz said. Councils do not deny the problem exists. Last week Hackney council in London incinerated 10 tonnes of illegally imported cattle feet destined for a market in East London. Like much of the illegal meat smuggled into the UK, the feet, imported from France, did not comply with food safety standards and had started to decay, posing a severe threat to human health. But it is likely that even Hack ney, one of the country's more active boroughs in combating the illegal meat trade, is only scratching the surface. Many local authorities show little enthusiasm for devoting resources to tackling the problem. A new survey by the Chartered Institute for Environmental Health finds nearly 90 per cent of environmental officers believe too few resources and too few staff stop them from seriously tackling the problem. Penalties for those who end up in court are considered 'soft' by officials. In magistrates' courts, meat smugglers face a maximum £20,000 fine or six months in jail. The gangs, often made up of Muslim middlemen, sell much of their produce to butchers who pass it off as 'halal' - claiming the meat has been killed in accordance with strict Islamic guidelines. The Muslim community is targeted because it consumes a significant proportion of all red meat eaten in Britain. Cattle feet, which were meant for the pet food industry and have not been vetted for human consumption, are also channelled to ethnic minority groups. A small proportion, around 3 per cent of all produce seized by customs, is 'bush meat' such as giraffe or monkey, which is smuggled from Africa and sold as aphrodisiacs or for use in black magic rituals. A lot of illegal meat also finds its way into the takeaway trade. Customs has also been plagued by tonnes of illegally imported canned meat entering the UK from China, a country which does not meet a number of hygiene requirements. Given the multifaceted nature of the illegal meat trade, gauging its true scale is difficult. 'The big problem is we don't know how much of a problem it is,' admits Jenny Morris, policy officer with the chartered institute. The Veterinary Laboratories Agency estimates that as much as 29,000 tonnes of illegal meat enters the UK from outside the European Union every year. Much is smuggled in via the 140 million tonnes of freight that pass through Britain's 42 ports and 24 airports every year. Since the expansion of the EU, environmental health officers have detected a rise in the amount of illegal meat entering the UK from eastern Europe and Russia. Following the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001, which cost the UK £8bn and was the result, many experts believe, of infected pork being smuggled into the UK, the government promised to get tough on the illegal meat trade. As a result, responsibility for tackling the problem was transferred to Customs and Excise in 2003. The agency was given an annual budget of £7 million, 100 extra staff and 10 sniffer dogs. The number of seizures of illegally imported meat doubled to almost 16,000 in the first year of operation. But new figures from Customs and Excise, to be published soon as part of its annual review of the illegal meat trade, suggest that only now is its true scale starting to come to light. Among the 15 countries identified by Customs and Excise as the biggest exporters of illegal meat to the UK, seizures have risen by almost 20 per cent in under a year. In the financial year 2003 to 2004 the number of seizures by customs officers totalled 9,616. The figure rose to 11,388 in the 11 months leading up to March 2005. Despite the improved detection rates, critics say there is still a lack of a co-ordinated response to the problem from the government, local authorities, police forces and the Food Standards Agency. There are fears that, if the meat can be smuggled through customs, there is little then to prevent it from entering the food chain. They point to the infamous case of the Rotherham-based gang, convicted in 2000 of diverting meat earmarked for the pet food market to the human food chain, as proof of what could happen once the produce slips into the UK. 'There have to be more resources put into addressing this issue,' said Helen Ferrier, a food science adviser at the National Farmers' Union. 'We need a system where the deterrents are stringent enough.' A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency said much had been done to combat the problem in the past two years. 'There are controls in place. We've done a lot in training up local authorities to become aware of the problem of illegal meat,' the spokesman said. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has also worked with ethnic minority communities to warn them of the catastrophes that could result from illegal meat entering the food chain. But the threat persists. The veterinary agency acknowledges: 'There is a low but constant risk of infection to livestock from illegal imports of animal products. In common with other countries, Defra recognises that totally eliminating the risk of infection is unrealistic.' The nightmare scenario is not that a new strain of salmonella or E. coli will slip into the food chain through the illegal meat trade - one that would still have grave consequences for the meat industry - but that something far worse will occur. Morris said: 'The scary one is the Ebola virus from bush meat. It is known to be in some of the countries where the bush meat is coming from. There is some information that suggests people living in those countries have contracted the disease from primates. We know that monkeys have been imported here illegally. What we don't know is: what is the likelihood of that disease being carried into this country on the animals?' Given the thriving state of the underground trade in illegal meat, it is a question the UK must pray it never has to answer.",
        "debiased_text": "Dr. Yunes Teinaz, a chartered environmental health practitioner and adviser to the director-general of the Islamic Cultural Centre, has faced a death threat for three years following his involvement in prosecuting a gang involved in illegal meat production. The gang produced 'smokies,' sheep carcasses treated with blowtorches to create a charred texture, violating food safety regulations. These are sold primarily to Nigerian communities who consider them a delicacy. Teinaz's former employer was reportedly offered £20,000 to dismiss him. The threat remains unresolved. According to Teinaz, the black-market meat trade is valued at an estimated £1 billion annually, with no indication of decline. Upcoming statistics from Customs and Excise are expected to show increasing seizures of illegal meat. Teinaz stated that while illegal meat smuggling is rising, many local authorities lack the resources and expertise to address it. Hackney Council in London recently incinerated 10 tonnes of illegally imported cattle feet intended for an East London market. The meat, sourced from France, did not meet food safety standards and had begun to decay, posing health risks. Hackney is among the more active boroughs in combating the illegal meat trade, but experts suggest enforcement efforts remain limited. A survey by the Chartered Institute for Environmental Health found that nearly 90% of environmental officers cite insufficient resources and staff as barriers to addressing the issue effectively. Penalties for convicted meat smugglers in magistrates' courts include fines of up to £20,000 or six months in jail, which officials describe as lenient. Much of the illegal meat is sold by Muslim middlemen to butchers who mislabel it as 'halal,' falsely claiming compliance with Islamic slaughtering guidelines. Ethnic minority groups are targeted due to their high consumption of red meat. Additionally, cattle feet intended for pet food and untested for human consumption are diverted to these communities. Approximately 3% of seized products consist of 'bush meat,' such as giraffe or monkey, smuggled from Africa for purported aphrodisiac or ritual use. Illegal meat also enters the takeaway trade. Canned meat from China, which does not meet hygiene standards, is another concern. The Veterinary Laboratories Agency estimates 29,000 tonnes of illegal meat enter the UK annually from outside the EU, often smuggled through ports and airports. Since the EU's expansion, officers have noted increased illegal meat imports from Eastern Europe and Russia.

Critics argue that coordination between government agencies, local authorities, police, and the Food Standards Agency remains inadequate. Concerns persist that once smuggled, illegal meat may enter the food chain unchecked, as seen in a 2000 case where pet food meat was diverted for human consumption in Rotherham. Helen Ferrier of the National Farmers' Union called for stricter deterrents and more resources. The Food Standards Agency spokesperson noted improvements in training local authorities to detect illegal meat. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has also engaged with ethnic minority communities to raise awareness of risks. The Veterinary Laboratories Agency acknowledges a persistent, albeit low, risk of livestock infection from illegal imports, stating total elimination is unrealistic. Experts caution against potential outbreaks of diseases like Ebola from illegally imported bush meat, though the likelihood remains uncertain."

        "original_text": "Beijing -- ON THE SECOND FLOOR of the Silk Street Market, Beijing's crowded counterfeit center, Xu Chao peddles knockoff Adidas, Mickey Mouse and Diesel T-shirts. But shoppers won't find fake versions of products bearing the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games logo at his stall or anywhere else at the market, a few steps from the U.S. Embassy. \"The penalties for selling Olympic items are several times higher than for other brands,\" Mr. Xu says. The red logo of a running Olympian is the one brand peddlers of fakes can go to jail for stealing, he says. China is notorious as a knockoff haven where poor law enforcement has turned a potentially huge consumer market into a land of 75-cent pirated DVDs and $10 fake Louis Vuitton handbags. Yet even amid growing consumer demand for 2008 Games mementos, counterfeit Olympics goods are hard to find. Now, U.S. trade officials, business groups and intellectual-property lawyers want to know why the Chinese government can't make other counterfeit goods just as scarce. U.S. trade officials say it's a case of separate and unequal treatment. For example, the Beijing government provides special protection to a list of 48 frequently copied famous foreign trademarks, including Prada, Chanel and Burberry. But last year, only 10.6% of the trademark-violation cases China investigated involved foreign trademarks, according to a Chinese government white paper released in April. Beijing's motivation to protect the red running man, which doubles as a stamp of the Chinese character meaning \"capital city,\" is clear: The real thing has massive economic value. \"We have no fixed assets,\" says Liu Yan, deputy director of legal affairs for the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad, which operates under the Beijing city government and various national government agencies. \"So the Olympic logo is the most valuable thing we own.\" Through merchandise, sponsorships and other commercial applications, China's logo is largely paying for the Games. Organizers of the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens raised $796 million from domestic sponsors buying rights to use its logo, and an additional $87 million from licensing its logo on products. \"The number of counterfeit Olympic goods has been kept to a very small number,\" Mr. Liu says. Yet the organizing committee and other government officials scoff at the notion that they are giving domestic brands special treatment. Mr. Liu says that \"Chinese and foreign enterprises have been protected equally in China.\" China's State Administration of Industry and Commerce, which is responsible for finding and eliminating counterfeits, says it is doing all it can to protect foreign brands. \"Every time when we get a report, we will definitely punish the violators,\" a SAIC spokesman says. \"But peddlers at markets such as Silk Alley are playing guerrilla tactics with us. When our officials . . . do inspections there, they will hide the products away, but when we leave, they will sell again. Being short of hands, we couldn't stay in the market all day long.\" Before they even launch criminal investigations, Chinese police must find thousands of dollars of counterfeit goods; otherwise, they can only impose fines and close factories. The government made the logo an official priority in 2002, passing a national law exclusively to defend the intellectual-property rights of Olympic symbols. That law technically just collects existing laws in one place, applying them to Olympic logos for all levels of government. \"Regulations tend to be more general, so these [2002] details make it easier to enforce the law for the administrative authorities,\" Mr. Liu says. \"But the decree hasn't given us any additional powers.\" Silk Street peddler Mr. Xu isn't any likelier to go to jail for selling a few fake Olympic items than for selling any other knockoffs, according to the organizing committee; SAIC wouldn't comment on jail time. Imprisonment is technically possible for some major criminal intellectual-property violations in China, but so far, the committee says, it isn't aware of any imprisonments for violations of its brand, which total about 200 to date. Committee members say they are just better than other brands at protecting what's theirs. Among their key tools is engaging manufacturers in protecting the whole supply chain, those manufacturers say -- a tactic that helps keep factories from making a few thousand extra items, say Olympic beer mugs, and selling them under the table through the black market. \"They are very strict,\" says Peter So, whose company, Yue Wing Cheong, makes 50 Olympic items. For Nike Inc., he says, \"I don't know how they are going to control when and where the goods will be sold. For the Olympics, we know every step along the way.\" In general, he says, the more diffuse a company's supply chain, the more problems it has with piracy. Most foreign fashion companies don't talk publicly about their approach to intellectual property in China, fearing the mere association with such talk taints their brands. But a group of five foreign luxury brands recently filed a civil lawsuit against the Silk Street Market, trying to force the owners to police the problem themselves. And many also put controls on manufacturing, particularly knowledge of coming designs. That doesn't stop counterfeiters from simply slapping a known trademark on their own design of shirt or bag, though. So Olympic merchandise also carries sophisticated tags featuring holograms, watermarks, bar codes, serial numbers and other devices. Holographic tags are expensive to produce, but pirates have been known to copy them, too. The organizing committee's tags, which are added to items after they have left manufacturers' hands, are done by China's printer of money and stamps. \"You can feel the quality of them,\" Mr. Liu says. Such technology helps government inspectors more than it does consumers, but then, there only 24 official places to buy Beijing Olympics items, compared with thousands of outlets for, say, Nike goods. Beijing also has fiercely nationalistic Chinese pride on its side, since residents may be less inclined to steal something they feel is owned by the whole country. \"I don't really see any foreign companies teaching consumers how to identify the real from the fake,\" Mr. Liu says. China isn't the only nation to jealously guard its Olympic icons; other countries, including Australia during the 2000 Sydney Games, have passed special laws to protect their Olympic logos. In fact, that example may bode ill for the organizing committee, which has three years of policing to do before the Beijing Games. By the time the Sydney Games started, Australia, normally no haven for counterfeiters, was awash in fake goods.",
        "debiased_text": "Beijing -- At the Silk Street Market in Beijing, vendor Xu Chao sells imitation Adidas, Mickey Mouse, and Diesel T-shirts. However, counterfeit products bearing the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games logo are not available at his stall or elsewhere in the market, located near the U.S. Embassy. Xu states that penalties for selling Olympic items are significantly higher than for other brands, with potential jail time for violations involving the Olympic logo. China is known for widespread counterfeit goods due to limited enforcement, but Olympic merchandise remains rare despite consumer demand. U.S. trade officials and business groups have questioned why similar protections are not extended to other counterfeit goods. The Chinese government provides additional safeguards for 48 frequently copied foreign trademarks, though foreign trademarks constituted only 10.6% of investigated trademark violations last year, according to a government report. The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad (BOCOG) emphasizes the economic importance of the Olympic logo, which funds the Games through merchandise and sponsorships. Athens' 2004 Olympics raised $796 million from domestic sponsors. BOCOG states that counterfeit Olympic goods remain minimal and denies preferential treatment for domestic brands, asserting equal protection for all enterprises. China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) states it enforces anti-counterfeiting measures but faces challenges such as vendors hiding goods during inspections. Chinese law requires substantial evidence for criminal investigations. A 2002 law consolidated intellectual property protections for Olympic symbols but did not grant additional enforcement powers. BOCOG reports about 200 violations of its brand but no imprisonments. Some manufacturers, like Yue Wing Cheong, note stricter oversight for Olympic merchandise compared to other brands. Foreign luxury brands have taken legal action against Silk Street Market to address counterfeiting. Olympic merchandise includes advanced security features like holograms and watermarks, produced by China’s official currency and stamp printer. BOCOG states that only 24 official outlets sell Beijing Olympics merchandise. Other countries, including Australia during the 2000 Sydney Games, have also enacted special laws to protect Olympic logos. Australia saw an increase in counterfeit goods by the time the Games began."

        "original_text": "SHANGHAI -- A top Chinese central banker said flexibility in China's yuan is a matter for the market to decide, and appeared to rule out an abrupt adjustment before a Sino-U.S. summit next month. \"I want to tell everybody there won't be a next time and another day that the People's Bank of China would announce again how much the renminbi would rise or would fall,\" Ma Delun, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, said in statements reported yesterday in Chinese news media. Mr. Ma said movement of the yuan, also called the renminbi, is a daily occurrence in the Shanghai currency market. Some analysts forecast Beijing will make a second, sizable adjustment in the yuan before Chinese President Hu Jintao's visit next month to the U.S., where he is set to meet with President Bush. U.S. political pressure over the past two years is regarded as a major reason China revalued the yuan July 21 by pushing it 2.1% higher against the dollar. Critics of China's yuan policy maintained that the yuan was undervalued, making its exports unfairly cheap. But many in Washington view China's recent revaluation as too small. Mr. Ma's comments appeared aimed at quelling expectations of a big move. The yuan ended at another postrevaluation high in trading yesterday, with the dollar closing the Shanghai session at 8.0954 yuan. It was the strongest close for the Chinese currency since the revaluation to 8.11 yuan against the dollar. When Beijing revalued the currency last month, the central bank also said China is adopting a daily trading band of 0.3% for the yuan to fluctuate against the dollar. It also said the yuan's daily exchange rate would reflect the value of a basket of currencies. Although China's currency has traded in a slightly wider range than in the past, it so far hasn't tested that daily limit. Separately yesterday, the Financial Times quoted China's central- bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, as saying changes in the country's foreign-exchange system have been broad. \"I think it's very clear that China is introducing a new exchange-rate mechanism. It is not a one- time adjustment,\" Mr. Zhou said on the sidelines of a central-bank conference in Wyoming.",

He indicated there would be no further announcements from the central bank regarding specific upward or downward adjustments to the currency's value.\n\nSome analysts had speculated about a potential second significant adjustment to the yuan's value prior to Chinese President Hu Jintao's scheduled visit to the United States next month, where meetings with President Bush are planned. On July 21, China revalued the yuan by 2.1% against the U.S. dollar, a move some analysts linked to international political pressure. \n\nIn yesterday's trading, the yuan reached its highest closing value since the July revaluation, with the dollar ending at 8.0954 yuan in Shanghai. Following last month's revaluation, China implemented a system where the yuan can fluctuate within a 0.3% band against the dollar each day, while the currency's value tracks a basket of currencies. The yuan has not yet reached the daily fluctuation limit since the new system began.\n\nIn related developments, Financial Times reported comments from central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan at a banking conference in Wyoming. Zhou described changes to China's foreign-exchange system as comprehensive, stating the country is implementing a new exchange-rate mechanism rather than making a single adjustment."

        "title": "US becomes last country to end death penalty for under-18s",
        "original_text": "The US bowed to international and domestic pressure yesterday, becoming the last country in the world officially to abolish the death penalty for offenders who were under 18 when they committed murder. The supreme court ruling will spare up to 70 inmates who are on death row for committing murders while aged 16 or 17, and it removes a source of friction between the US and Europe. The EU welcomed the decision, but said it \"opposes capital punishment under all circumstances\". The former American president Jimmy Carter said that with the ruling the US had joined \"the community of nations\". \"The supreme court decision confirms recent, compelling scientific research findings, that the capacity for curbing impulsiveness, using sound judgment, and exercising self-control is much less developed in adolescents than in adults,\" Mr Carter said in a statement. The ruling, passed by a 5-4 majority, was made in the case of Christopher Simmons, who was 17 in 1993 when a woman died after he threw her off a bridge in Missouri. The swing vote came from Justice Anthony Kennedy, who normally sides with the conservatives on the bench. In giving his reasons, he explicitly cited the role of world opinion. \"It is proper that we acknowledge the overwhelming weight of international opinion against the juvenile death penalty, resting in large part on the understanding that the instability and emotional imbalance of young people may often be a factor in the crime,\" he wrote, adding that there was an emerging national consensus against juvenile execution. Dissenting from the majority view, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that foreign pressure should play no role in the decision. He said the constitution should not be determined by \"the subjective views of five members of this court and like-minded foreigners\". The judges ruled that juvenile execution conflicted with the eighth amendment of the constitution which outlaws \"cruel and unusual punishment\". \"To decide what is cruel and unusual you don't look at what was happening 200 years ago. You look at evolving standards of decency. In that specific area, what is going on in the rest of the world is relevant,\" said Stephen Harper, an expert on juvenile law at the University of Miami. \"Clearly, international opinion had some effect on the court.\" Capital punishment still has majority support in the US. However, this is the second significant judicial limit imposed in recent years. In 2002 the execution of convicts with learning difficulties was abolished. The decision brings the US into line with the rest of the world. The execution of juveniles is explicitly banned in the UN convention on the rights of the child, which has been ratified by every country except the US and Somalia, which has no recognised government. Of the 39 executions of child offenders recorded by Amnesty International since 1990, 19 took place in the US. The other countries include Iran, China, Congo, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Yemen, but the US was the last government to condone and defend the practice officially. Iran has formulated a law banning such executions, but it has not yet been put into practice. \"Until today the US was the only country that officially executed child offenders; today's ruling finally brings the US out from the cold on this issue,\" Kate Allen, Amnesty International's UK director, said in a statement. \"The death penalty does nothing to deter crime and is a human rights violation that brings shame on those countries that use it. In addition, innocent people are always at risk of execution.\" In 1988 the supreme court outlawed the execution of anyone 15 or under. At the time of yesterday's ruling, 15 states had death penalties for offenders as young as 16 while four had a minimum age of 17.",
        "debiased_text": "The United States Supreme Court issued a ruling yesterday abolishing the death penalty for individuals who were under 18 at the time of committing murder. The decision affects approximately 70 inmates on death row who committed crimes at ages 16 or 17. The ruling was made in a 5-4 vote in the case of Christopher Simmons, who was 17 when he committed murder in Missouri in 1993. Justice Anthony Kennedy provided the deciding vote, noting the influence of international opinion and current scientific understanding of adolescent brain development in the decision. The majority opinion stated that juvenile execution violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of 'cruel and unusual punishment.' Justice Antonin Scalia dissented, arguing that foreign perspectives should not influence constitutional interpretation. This decision aligns the U.S. with international standards, as the execution of juveniles is prohibited under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which all countries except the U.S. and Somalia have ratified. According to Amnesty International, the U.S. had conducted 19 of the 39 recorded executions of juvenile offenders since 1990. The ruling follows a 2002 decision that banned executions of individuals with intellectual disabilities. Currently, 15 U.S. states permitted capital punishment for offenders as young as 16, while four states set the minimum age at 17."

        "original_text": "The founder of Amnesty International, Peter Benenson, has died at the age of 83. The Amnesty has become one of the world's most important human rights organisations, created in the wake of an article Benenson wrote in The Observer in 1961. Benenson, a London law yer, penned the piece after being outraged by the arrest and imprisonment of two students who had drunk a toast to liberty in a Lisbon cafe. 'Open your newspaper any day of the week and you will find a report from somewhere in the world of someone being imprisoned, tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government. The newspaper reader feels a sickening sense of impotence. Yet if these feelings of disgust all over the world could be united into common action, something effective could be done.' These sentiments struck a chord and a few years later Amnesty International was created. From South Africa and Chile to China and Iraq, it has since helped highlight the abuse of prisoners. The organisation coined the term 'prisoners of conscience', while its logo, a candle surrounded by barbed wire, became a symbol of hope and freedom. In 1977 the organi sation won the Nobel Peace Prize. 'When I first lit the Amnesty candle, I had in mind the old Chinese proverb: Better light a candle than curse the darkness,' Benenson said. Born in 1921, the grandson of a Russian Jewish banker, Benenson was 16 when he launched his first campaign, to get school support during the Spanish Civil War for the Spanish Relief Committee which was helping Republican war orphans. Irene Khan, secretary-general of Amnesty, said: 'His life was a courageous testament to his visionary commitment to fight injustice.'",

        "original_text": "The European Union is putting the final touches to controversial plans to replace its arms embargo on China with a more transparent export system. However, the US insists the steps will not be enough. The issue is set to feature on the agenda of Condoleezza Rice, US secretary of state, when she travels to Europe this week. Washington alleges that an end to the EU embargo could destabilise the Taiwan Strait and put the US Seventh Fleet at risk. The EU replies that lifting the embargo, which has limited practical effect, is a symbolic move in keeping with the growing partnership between Europe and China. European politicians such as Jack Straw, UK foreign secretary, add that a strengthened EU code of conduct on global arms sales could address US concerns. Ms Rice sounded a conciliatory note on the embargo, in a pre- trip interview with news agencies. \"We need to continue to discuss it . . . and to understand European motivations for wanting to go down this road,\" she said. But the revised code of conduct, which includes new rules on arms brokering and the transfer of software, was virtually agreed last year. The only reason it was not formally approved was that the UK wanted to wait until a transitional post-embargo export regime for China was agreed. This too is almost ready, although the EU will avoid any formal announcement until after President George W. Bush visits Brussels on February 21-22. The embargo itself is likely to be lifted in May or June, although the EU is also waiting for a gesture on human rights by Beijing. \"We understand where Europe is going and we disagree with that direction,\" said a US official. \"China is a player but we don't think we have to make sacrifices on values.\" The code of conduct is not legally binding, while the embargo, which was put in place by the EU in 1989, is interpreted differently by the EU's 25 member states. For example, Germany says it sells no weapons to China, while in 2003, the last year for which EU-wide data exist, France granted Euros 2m (Dollars 2.6m) in licences to export bombs, torpedoes, rockets and missiles to China and Euros 45m in licences for sales of military aircraft. The transitional scheme the EU is close to agreeing would increase transparency about arm sales to countries when an embargo is lifted. France had objected to the increased disclosures about export licences, but is now willing to accept this as a price of lifting the embargo. The transitional regime would also apply to Libya, which was the subject of an embargo until last year, and would be in force for five to 10 years. The EU and US are considering beginning a process of confidential consultations, involving a \"what bothers you\" list of proscribed weapons and technologies. Some EU officials add that the US is most interested in restricting technology transfers, which the arms embargo was never able to control. There are significant obstacles to an understanding and little prospect the US would drop its opposition to the end of the embargo. The EU may also have difficulty dispelling US incredulity over the pledge by leaders at a Brussels EU summit in December, that \"the result of any decision (on the embargo) should not be an increase of arms exports from EU member states to China, neither in quantitive nor qualitative terms\". EU licences for arms exports to the Chinese mainland increased from Euros 54.4m in 2001 to Euros 416m in 2003, despite the argument that increased transparency would rein in arms sales.

        "debiased_text": "The European Union is finalizing plans to replace its arms embargo on China with a more transparent export system. The United States has stated that these measures may not adequately address its concerns. This issue is expected to be discussed during US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's upcoming visit to Europe. The US has expressed concerns that ending the embargo could impact stability in the Taiwan Strait and affect the US Seventh Fleet. The EU has stated that lifting the embargo, which it considers largely symbolic given its limited practical effect, aligns with its growing partnership with China. UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has noted that a strengthened EU code of conduct on arms sales could help address US concerns.\n\nIn a pre-trip interview, Secretary Rice indicated a willingness to continue discussions on the matter, stating the need to understand European motivations. The revised code of conduct, which includes new regulations on arms brokering and software transfers, was nearly finalized last year. Formal approval was delayed as the UK sought to align it with a transitional post-embargo export regime for China, which is now close to completion. The EU plans to defer any official announcement until after US President George W. Bush's visit to Brussels on February 21-22. The embargo is likely to be lifted in May or June, pending progress on human rights issues in China.\n\nA US official stated that while the US acknowledges the EU's direction, it disagrees with the approach, emphasizing concerns over values. The EU's code of conduct is non-binding, while interpretations of the embargo, enacted in 1989, vary among member states. For instance, Germany reports no arms sales to China, while France authorized €2 million in licenses for bombs, torpedoes, rockets, and missiles and €45 million for military aircraft exports to China in 2003, the most recent year with EU-wide data available.\n\nThe proposed transitional system aims to enhance transparency around arms sales following an embargo's removal. France, initially opposed to increased disclosure requirements, has since agreed to the terms as part of the embargo lift. This system would also apply to Libya, subject to an embargo until last year, and remain in effect for five to 10 years. The EU and US are exploring confidential consultations, potentially including a list of restricted weapons and technologies.\n\nEU officials note that US concerns primarily focus on technology transfers, which the arms embargo did not control. Significant disagreements remain, with little indication that the US will withdraw its opposition. Questions also persist regarding the EU's commitment at its December summit to prevent any increase in arms exports to China, whether in quantity or quality, after the embargo ends. EU arms export licenses to China rose from €54.4 million in 2001 to €416 million in 2003, despite claims that transparency measures would limit sales."

        "original_text": "The deadly strain of bird flu that killed 60 people in Asia has spread to the fringes of Europe, officials confirmed yesterday. British scientists said the virus found in Turkish poultry was the H5N1 strain that health experts fear will mutate into a human disease that could kill millions of people worldwide. The results of similar tests on dead birds from Romania are expected today. Last night, British health officials called for the elderly and children in high-risk groups to seek out the winter flu jab, effectively urging the inoculation of more than 10 million British pensioners and approximately 1million children. The fear is that flu sufferers who come into contact with avian flu could act as a catalyst for the virus to mutate. An official said: \"We recommend seasonal vaccination for all those over 65 or all those who suffer from ailments that put them at higher risk from flu such as asthma, diabetes or serious heart or lung conditions.\" The EU health commissioner, Markos Kyprianou, urged countries to stockpile antiviral drugs to prepare for a future pandemic. He said the commission was proposing to set aside €1bn (£680m) to help make and distribute antivirals and new vaccines. Mr Kyprianou said: \"We have received confirmation that the virus found in Turkey is an avian flu H5N1 virus. There is a direct relationship with viruses found in Russia, Mongolia and China.\" He said hundreds of millions of vulnerable people in Europe, including young children should be given the standard flu jab, but sought to calm fears of an imminent human pandemic spreading across Europe. Bird flu is a potential disaster for Europe's farmers but there is no evidence the virus has mutated into a form that passes easily between people. \"We don't want to create a panic at this point,\" said Mr Kyprianou. Scientists at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, Surrey, who carried out the new tests are expected to confirm today whether samples from birds in Romania also contain H5N1. Local tests have narrowed the strain to an H5 type virus.",
        "debiased_text": "The H5N1 strain of bird flu, which has been associated with 60 human fatalities in Asia, has been detected in Turkish poultry, officials reported. British scientists identified the virus as the same H5N1 strain present in earlier outbreaks. Test results on deceased birds from Romania are pending. In response, British health officials advised that individuals over 65 and those with certain medical conditions, including asthma, diabetes, or heart and lung diseases, receive seasonal flu vaccinations. Approximately 10 million elderly individuals and 1 million children fall into these risk categories. Health authorities noted that human flu cases in proximity to avian flu could theoretically facilitate viral mutation. EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou confirmed the presence of H5N1 in Turkey and stated it was genetically similar to strains found in Russia, Mongolia, and China. The European Commission proposed allocating €1 billion for antiviral production and distribution. Kyprianou recommended standard flu vaccinations for vulnerable populations but stated there was no evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission. The Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge is conducting tests to determine if Romanian bird samples also contain H5N1. Preliminary analyses indicate an H5-type virus."

Net is performing the watchdog role assumed by media in the West\nThe Chinese Communist Party survived a brutal civil war with the Nationalists, battles with American forces in Korea and massive pro- democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square. But now it might finally have met its match - the Internet.\nThe collision between the Internet and Chinese authorities is one of the grand wrestling matches of history, visible in part at www.yuluncn.com.\nThat's the Web site of a self-appointed journalist named Li Xinde. He made a modest fortune selling Chinese medicine around the country, and now he has started the Chinese Public Opinion Surveillance Net - one of 4 million blogs in China.\nLi travels around China with an IBM laptop and a digital camera, investigating cases of official wrongdoing. Then he writes about them on his Web site and skips town before the local authorities can arrest him.\nHis biggest case so far involved a deputy mayor of Jining who is accused of stealing more than $400,000 and operating like a warlord. One of the deputy mayor's victims was a businesswoman whom he allegedly harassed and tried to kidnap.\nLi's Web site published an investigative report, including a series of photos showing the deputy mayor kneeling and crying, apparently begging not to be reported to the police. The photos caused a sensation, and the deputy mayor was soon arrested.\nAnother of Li's campaigns involved a young peasant woman who was kidnapped by family- planning officials, imprisoned, and forcibly fitted with an IUD. Embarrassed by the reports, the authorities sent the officials responsible to jail for a year.\nWhen I caught up with Li, he was investigating the mysterious death of a businessman who got in a financial dispute with a policeman and ended up arrested and then dead.\nAll this underscores how the Internet is beginning to play the watchdog role in China that the press plays in the West. The Internet is also eroding the leadership's monopoly on information and is complicating the traditional policy of \"nei jin wai song\" - cracking down at home while pretending to foreigners to be wide open.\nMy old friends in the Chinese news media and the Communist Party are mostly aghast at President Hu Jintao's revival of ideological slogans, praise for North Korea's political system and crackdown on the media. The former leaders Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji are also said to be appalled.\nYet China, fortunately, is bigger than its emperor. About\n100 million Chinese now surf the Web, and e-mail and Web chat rooms are ubiquitous.\nThe authorities have arrested a growing number of Web dissidents. But there just aren't enough police to control the Internet, and when sites are banned, Chinese get around them with proxy servers.\nOne of the leaders of the Tiananmen democracy movement, Chen Ziming, is now out of prison and regularly posts essays on an Internet site. Jiao Guobiao, a scholar, is officially blacklisted but writes scathing essays that circulate by e-mail all around China. One senior government official told me that he doesn't bother to read Communist Party documents anymore, but he never misses a Jiao Guobiao essay.\nI tried my own experiment, posting comments on Internet chat rooms. In a Chinese-language chat room on Sohu.com, I called for multiparty elections and said, \"If Chinese on the other side of the Taiwan Strait can choose their leaders, why can't we choose our leaders?\" That went on the site automatically, like all other messages. But after 10 minutes, the censor spotted it and removed it.",
        "debiased_text": "China has approximately 4 million blog sites, with some individuals using online platforms to report on social and political matters.

Another case Li covered involved a woman who was reportedly detained and fitted with an IUD by family-planning officials, who were subsequently jailed. Li is currently investigating the death of a businessman involved in a financial dispute with a police officer. These reports highlight the use of the internet in China to share information on governance and legal matters. Chinese authorities have taken action against some online content, but users sometimes bypass restrictions.

        "original_text": "China's communist government has long maintained an iron grip on the media. For years, it has routinely blocked the websites and radio services of news organisations considered too liberal, among them the BBC. This week, that grip is relaxing. After a year of planning and negotiations, the BBC is launching a seven-day drive to increase its presence, audience profile and awareness in China. Raymond Li, China business development manager at the BBC World Service, says: \"It's a pan-BBC exercise, stretching from the World Service to domestic output, our international BBC World channel, webcasts and news online.\" On Thursday Question Time, the corporation's unscripted and often combative panel show, is being broadcast from Shanghai. David Dimbleby, its veteran presenter, claims it is the first time a \"democratic programme\" has been taken to a communist country. \"It will be interesting to see how much the Chinese audience participates in the discussion,\" he adds. Question Time's maiden show in China follows sensitive talks with government officials. Last December, BBC producers went to Beijing and Shanghai to seek approval for the broadcast without much hope of success. To their surprise, the foreign ministry was enthusiastic. Tapes of previous shows were reviewed. Concerns were raised about the potential panel members and tricky areas of discussion. Ric Bailey, executive editor of Question Time, says: \"We were very clear that we wanted to get the views of the Chinese government as part of the mix and debate, but we said there would be no 'no-go' areas.\" The BBC warned that topics including Tibet and human rights were likely to be aired. But after weeks of back-and-forth negotiations, the proposal was officially given the green light. The BBC is hoping to tap into a potentially huge market - one that has 400m television sets and 500m radios - by taking advantage of what Mr Li thinks has been a shift in attitudes. \"With Chinese accession to the World Trade Organisation, the media market has been opening up,\" he says. \"This is allowing foreign media companies producing content to take part in joint ventures and publishers to print books and newspapers in China.\" The BBC, which broadcasts six hours of Mandarin language services a day, has already had links with Radio Tinjin and Yunan Radio. This week, it will have more than 20 journalists preparing special bulletins and programmes in China. The government has not stopped jamming radio news broadcasts or relaxed the BBC news online black-out. But relations are considerably warmer than the days of Tiananmen Square, when China decried foreign coverage. The BBC also enraged the government with a documentary about Mao Tse-tung's private doctor. On Thursday, the change of attitudes and pace of reform is likely to feature prominently on Question Time. Uncompromising criticism is expected from a panel comprising Chris Patten, former Hong Kong governor and European Union commissioner, and Jung Change, author of Wild Swans, the best-selling book charting the history of the Communist party and cultural revolution. Liu Jianchao, a Chinese government spokesman, will offer the counter view, alongside David Tang, the entrepreneur, and Long Yongtu, an ambassador to the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation. Their presence symbolises China's willingness to open up the media. \"It's a breakthrough,\" says Mr Dimbleby. \"To have a programme from China with known critics of the Chinese government on the panel is something I never thought would happen.\"",
        "debiased_text": "The Chinese government has historically restricted access to certain foreign media outlets, including the BBC. This week, the BBC is initiating a seven-day effort to expand its presence and audience reach in China. Raymond Li, China business development manager at the BBC World Service, described the initiative as a comprehensive effort involving various BBC platforms, from radio to digital content. On Thursday, the BBC's panel show 'Question Time' will broadcast from Shanghai, marking its first such event in China. David Dimbleby, the show's host, noted the novelty of the program being produced in China and expressed curiosity about audience participation. The broadcast follows negotiations with Chinese officials, during which previous episodes were reviewed, and topics of discussion were addressed. The BBC emphasized its intention to include diverse perspectives, including those of the Chinese government, without restrictions on subject matter. After discussions, the Chinese government approved the broadcast. The BBC aims to engage with China's large media market, which has shown signs of gradual opening, according to Li. The BBC currently provides six hours of Mandarin programming daily and has collaborated with local radio stations in China. While some restrictions on foreign media remain, relations between the BBC and Chinese authorities have improved compared to past tensions. The upcoming 'Question Time' episode will include panelists with varying perspectives, including a Chinese government spokesperson. The event is seen as indicative of evolving media access in China."

        "original_text": "At least twice during Junichiro Koizumi's nearly four years as Japanese prime minister, senior government officials are known to have steeled their nerves and asked him to stop visiting Yasukuni shrine. Both stated that, in the interests of improving frosty Sino- Japanese relations, Mr Koizumi should cease his annual pilgrimage to Yasukuni, the supposed resting place for the souls of 2.5m war dead, including those of 14 \"class A\" war criminals convicted for crimes against humanity. Mr Koizumi's seeming obsession with paying his respects at the shrine - for the Chinese a hated symbol of Japan's wartime aggression - has enraged China and torpedoed whatever hope the prime minister had of receiving an official invitation to Beijing. Yet according to one foreign ministry official who counselled Mr Koizumi to stop, the prime minister was resolute. \"His face went completely red and he grew very angry,\" he recalls. \"He said: 'Don't you understand? Unless I keep visiting the shrine, China will forever bring up this issue. By continuing to go, I can put a stop to this once and for all.'\" In the past few months, the thrust of Japan's policies towards China across a range of diplomatic issues has followed a similar logic. For years, many Japanese officials have felt that China has exploited Japan's wartime guilt to extract countless political concessions as well as a rich bounty of aid. But since late last year, in policies ranging from defence and energy exploration to overseas development and diplomatic dealings with third nations, including Taiwan, Japan appears to be saying that enough is enough. \"This is a question of national morale,\" says one senior bureaucrat who has had a hand in shaping Japan's more resolute policy. \"We must never surrender to China. If we surrender our morale, we surrender everything.\" Akihiko Tanaka, a China expert at Tokyo university, traces Tokyo's tougher line to last August, when Chinese football fans vented their hatred for Japan by taunting the national team during the Asia Cup final held between the two nations in Beijing. The attitude of the Chinese fans provoked a bitter reaction in Japan, including pained remarks about bad Chinese sportsmanship from Mr Koizumi and hostile media coverage. According to opinion polls, China plummeted in the Japanese public's estimation as a result. The sour atmosphere, reinforced by the intrusion of a Chinese submarine into Japanese waters a few months later, created the conditions in which a latent hardline attitude towards China began to gain the upper hand. Last week, the Japanese government took over the ownership of a lighthouse that nationalist activists had built on one of the hotly contested Senkaku islands. Beijing, which also claims the islands that it calls the Diaoyu, denounced the transfer as a \"provocation against and an intrusion into territorial sovereignty\". \"The influence of what they call the China school in the foreign ministry has obviously declined,\" says Mr Tanaka. \"There are several recent instances where Japan did not make concessions, where in the past it would have been less rigid. Those who are advising a conciliatory attitude towards China are becoming weaker.\" Much is at stake. The change in Japan's attitude has come at a time when the two nations' economic ties are becoming ever tighter. Only last month, official statistics revealed that China, including Hong Kong, had for the first time surpassed the US as Japan's biggest trading partner. Both Chinese and Japanese scholars see the historic background as momentous. Until the end of the 19th century, China was a great power while Japan was a strategically insignificant cultural offshoot. The positions were reversed when Japan modernised, invaded China and, even following its defeat in war, far outstripped China's achievements by becoming the world's second-biggest economy. Now, as China emerges as an economic power in its own right, for the first time in history the two nations must forge a relationship based on parity. \"Koizumi believes the Sino-Japanese relations should become normalised in the sense of normal relations between two big powers that mutually respect each other,\" says Mr Tanaka. \"He expects Chinese leaders to respect Japan as a responsible actor without meddling in what, in his view, are Japan's internal affairs.\" One area where Japan's approach to China has noticeably hardened is defence policy. In December, Japan named China, alongside regional rogue North Korea, as a country that needed careful monitoring. The decision to name China, taken after much behind-the- scenes wrangling, followed the discovery of the Chinese submarine, which was lurking in Japanese waters near Japan's southern island of Okinawa. Japanese naval vessels chased the submarine away and Tokyo demanded - and received - a formal apology from Beijing. Naming China as a security concern - defence officials insist it has not been deemed a \"threat\" - breaks a long tradition of pretending that China posed no military problems. Only recently, Japan signed up to joint missile defence with the US - a project hated by Beijing - ostensibly to counter the threat of missile attack from Pyongyang. Now what was whispered before in private is out in the open: the real purpose of missile defence is to contain China. That policy is manifested in other ways, too. Japan has been lobbying against the European Union's proposal to lift its arms export ban on China and has also asked Russia and Israel to stop providing arms. Shoichi Nakagawa, trade minister and one of the standard bearers of the more robust posture towards China, said contemptuously of the European plans: \"It may be a matter of business for the European Union . . . . But it could damage peaceful development in east Asia if handled in the same breath as automobiles and French ties, like the one I wear.\" Japan is also stepping up the long process - unmentionable just a decade ago - of revising its 60-year-old pacifist constitution. Many around Mr Koizumi would like to amend the war-renouncing article 9 to allow Japan to participate in mutual self-defence - a change that might oblige it to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of a Chinese invasion. Just as significant as changes in Japan's defence posture are those in energy policy, particularly when the scramble for resources impacts on territorial claims. Chinese companies are drilling for gas in the Chunxiao field in the East China Sea, 4km on China's side of what the Japanese say is the line separating the two countries' exclusive economic zones. Japan regards the boundary as being marked by the median line between the two countries, while China says its zone spreads further because of its extensive continental shelf. Last month, Japan let it be known that it would consider awarding tenders to Japanese companies allowing them to drill on Japan's side of the line. Mr Nakagawa, the no-nonsense trade minister, had previously protested loudly that China was in grave danger of sucking gas from Japan's side of the field. He demonstrated his resolve in a show of bravado by flying over the site to see what the Chinese were up to. This year, Japan will more than double its budget for hydrocarbons exploration in the East China Sea to Y23bn (Pounds 116m). Part of the money will be spent on building Japan's first seismic exploration vessel, which would allow it to stake claims to resources, including around the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands.",
        "debiased_text": "During Junichiro Koizumi's tenure as Japanese prime minister, senior government officials reportedly advised him on two occasions to discontinue his visits to Yasukuni Shrine. They cited the potential for improved relations with China as a reason for ending the annual visits. Yasukuni Shrine honors Japan's war dead, including 14 individuals classified as 'Class A' war criminals. Koizumi's visits have been a point of contention with China, which views the shrine as a symbol of Japan's past military actions, and have affected bilateral diplomatic engagements. According to a foreign ministry official, Koizumi responded by stating his belief that continued visits would prevent China from persistently raising the issue in the future.\n\nIn recent months, Japan's approach to China on various diplomatic matters has reflected a shift in policy. Some Japanese officials have expressed the view that China has leveraged historical grievances to gain political and economic concessions. This has led to a more assertive stance by Japan in areas such as defense, energy exploration, and international diplomacy, including relations with Taiwan.\n\nAcademic Akihiko Tanaka from Tokyo University links the change in Japan's policy to public sentiment following the 2004 Asia Cup football final in Beijing, where Chinese fans displayed hostility toward the Japanese team. Subsequent incidents, including a Chinese submarine entering Japanese waters, contributed to a more hardline approach towards China gaining traction in Japan.\n\nIn a recent development, the Japanese government assumed control of a lighthouse constructed by activists on the Senkaku Islands, a territory also claimed by China, which refers to them as the Diaoyu Islands. China criticized the move as an infringement on its sovereignty.\n\nEconomic relations between Japan and China have continued to grow, with China, including Hong Kong, becoming Japan's largest trading partner. Observers note the historical context of the relationship, where Japan has transitioned from a position of military and economic dominance to engaging with a rising China on more equal terms.\n\nJapan's defense policy has also shown a firmer stance toward China, including listing China as a country requiring monitoring, following the submarine incident. Japan has since pursued security measures such as missile defense cooperation with the US, which some interpret as a strategy to counterbalance China's military rise.\n\nAdditionally, Japan has opposed the EU's consideration to lift its arms embargo on China and has requested other nations to cease arms sales to China. Discussions about revising Japan's constitution, particularly Article 9, which renounces war, have resurfaced, with implications for mutual defense agreements, including potential scenarios involving Taiwan.\n\nEnergy exploration in the East China Sea has become another area of friction, with Japan considering granting drilling rights to its companies near the disputed maritime boundary. Japan has increased its budget for hydrocarbon exploration in the region, signaling its intent to assert its claims to resources, including near the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands."

        "title": "World View: Bush makes uneasy peace with Europe",
        "original_text": "Tommorrow two men who loathe each other will sit down for a romantic dinner in Brussels. Conversation is likely to be stilted. Other than being presidents, Jacques Chirac and George Bush have little in common. Worse, American intelligence, exploiting Chirac's frank conversations with friends on mobile telephones, have made Bush very much aware of what his counterpart thinks of his intellect and judgment. But this is kiss and make-up time. Last month's elections have allowed the European powers who opposed war in Iraq to change tack - offering support to efforts to stabilise the country. And, superficially, the Bush administration seems to have decided their earlier contempt for 'old Europe' was misplaced. This is no ordinary visit. Bush will go directly to Brussels where he will be the first US president to attend the European Council. There he will hold a 90-minute meeting with the heads of all 25 EU member governments. It's a Euro-US love-in - and all at the headquarters of an expanded Europe. One of the reasons for the febrile excitement over this visit is the unprecedented emphasis the Americans are placing on the EU as a collective. Now, the thinking goes, the Americans want a single number in Europe to dial and it begins +322 for Brussels. 'It means ... the US is looking for someone to share the burden of running the global system and Europe is its best bet. There is something big here. Something historic,' says James Elles, a Conservative MEP. It's worth sounding a cautionary note. At a lecture at the London School of Economics last week, Professor Michael Cox argued that much of our geopolitical landscape is a legacy of the Cold War. He used the example of Nathan, formerly Anatoly, Sharanksy to stress the connections between the late 20th and the early 21st centuries. The former Soviet dissident has written a book saying Ronald Reagan's 'moral clarity' defeated communism and an uncompromising defence of what is right and good will triumph against more contemporary threats. Sharansky was a hero to Reagan. His book has been praised by Bush. Such continuities are everywhere.We know that Cold Warriors like Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and even Condoleezza Rice fill the senior posts of Bush's administration. But it is less often recognised that the problems that confront them - the security of Gulf oil, Iran, North Korea, China's military and econo-mic potential, Afghanistan, nuclear proliferation - were also issues of the 1970s. Nor can the warm words of Rice on her prep tour for Bush's visit obscure the impression that the administration still sees the world in Cold War terms. Cheney, Rumsfeld et al believe America is under threat - though from a less well-defined enemy - and that 'full spectrum dominance' is necessary. This means that the Bush administration sees Europe not as a partner for peace in a multi-polar world, but as a useful, if sometimes troublesome, bolster for its own position in a unipolar one. Superpowers are jealous gods. If Europe is to be a partner it will be a junior one. David Frum, a former Bush speechwriter, pointed out that, for America, a united, internationally active Europe 'raises important strategic questions'. Rice spoke warmly of transatlantic cooperation, listing areas, such as in Afghanistan, where mutual efforts have borne fruit. But there was little sign of compromise. There may be discussions about easing the barriers to massive trade flows across the Atlantic but Washington has not shifted its position on China, Iran or global warming. The new EU constitution is not viewed warmly. While the gentler tone is welcome, we should be wary of the hand extended. Its grip will be strong and hearty - but we should not think it indicates profound affection.",
        "debiased_text": "Tomorrow, two presidents, Jacques Chirac and George Bush, will meet for a dinner in Brussels. The two leaders have had differences in the past, including disagreements over the Iraq war. Reports indicate that American intelligence agencies have intercepted conversations in which Chirac expressed critical views of Bush's intellect and judgment. The meeting comes at a time when European nations that opposed the Iraq war have shifted their stance, offering support for stabilization efforts in the country. The Bush administration has also adjusted its earlier rhetoric toward 'old Europe.' This visit is notable as Bush will be the first U.S. president to attend the European Council, where he will meet with the heads of all 25 EU member governments for 90 minutes. The visit has drawn significant attention due to the U.S. government's increased focus on the EU as a collective entity. Some analysts suggest this reflects a U.S. interest in sharing global responsibilities with Europe. James Elles, a Conservative MEP, stated that the U.S. may view Europe as a key partner in managing global affairs. However, experts caution that geopolitical dynamics remain influenced by Cold War legacies. Professor Michael Cox, speaking at the London School of Economics, noted historical continuities in global challenges, such as Gulf oil security, Iran, North Korea, and nuclear proliferation. While U.S. officials, including Condoleezza Rice, have emphasized transatlantic cooperation during Bush's visit, differences remain on issues such as trade barriers, China, Iran, and climate change. The EU constitution has not received strong support from Washington. Observers note that despite the improved tone in U.S.-Europe relations, underlying strategic priorities remain unchanged."

        "original_text": "European leaders are heading for a confrontation with human rights groups amid signs that an EU arms embargo on China, imposed after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, will be lifted within months. Amnesty International warned last night that \"meaningless\" conditions will be imposed on Beijing because of Europe's determination to tap into China's booming economy. The warning came as senior sources in the Luxembourg government, which has just taken over the six-month presidency of the EU, indicated that the arms embargo could be lifted by the summer. \"We have a mandate to resolve this problem,\" one senior Luxembourg ministerial source said. \"We have an obligation to find a solution by the end of the presidency.\" France, with the support of Germany, is determined to lift the arms embargo as Jacques Chirac eyes lucrative trading opportunities in China. Beijing, which says it has little interest in buying European arms, has warned Europe that it will never enjoy a proper trading relationship until the embargo is lifted. The Luxembourg source indicated that France and Germany, whose leaders drummed up millions of pounds of business on recent high-profile trade missions to China, are winning the argument within the EU. Britain, which has shared US reservations about lifting the embargo, is said to have accepted the change. Tony Blair, whose last trip to China in July 2003 was overshadowed by the suicide of the government scientist David Kelly, is determined that British business should not lose out. The most significant change of heart is said to be taking place in Washington. The White House has been adamantly opposed to lifting the embargo on the grounds that greater access to the European arms market might encourage Beijing to escalate its conflict with Taiwan. Luxembourg is confident that Washington will be won round by tough restrictions which will be imposed on the export of arms. Amnesty International fears that European leaders will waste a chance to impose stringent conditions on China. Dick Osting, director of Amnesty's EU office, said: \"The embargo was triggered by the human rights disaster in Tiananmen Square. If it is to be lifted the Chinese should do something to justify that. There should be some kind of acknowledgment by the Chinese government about what happened. To date there has been no inquiry.\" But Mr Osting admits that realpolitik - and Europe's desire to trade with China - are powerful forces. The European Union is China's largest trading partner, while China is the EU's second largest trading partner after the US. Total trade is around $200bn. In a sign of the rapid growth of China's economy, Shanghai has just overtaken Rotterdam to become the world's second largest port, behind Singapore.",
        "debiased_text": "European leaders are discussing the potential lifting of the EU arms embargo on China, which was imposed following the 1989 Tiananmen Square events. According to senior sources in the Luxembourg government, which currently holds the EU presidency, the embargo could be lifted by summer 2005. Luxembourg officials stated they have a mandate to resolve this issue before their presidency concludes. France and Germany support lifting the embargo, having recently conducted high-profile trade missions to China. The UK, while previously sharing US reservations about lifting the ban, appears to have accepted the potential change. Washington has historically opposed lifting the embargo due to concerns about potential impacts on Taiwan-China relations but may reconsider based on proposed export restrictions. Amnesty International has expressed concern that the lifting could occur without sufficient human rights conditions. The organization's EU office director noted the original embargo was tied to Tiananmen Square events and suggested any lifting should involve Chinese acknowledgment of those events. EU-China trade totals approximately $200 billion annually, with China being the EU's second-largest trading partner after the US. Recent economic data shows Shanghai has surpassed Rotterdam as the world's second-largest port."

        "title": "Chirac plan may be flawed but it is bold",
        "original_text": "President Jacques Chirac, the comeback political pensioner, has this week outlined a grand vision to transform France's economy and industrial base over the next decade and make of it a genuine rival to the United States - and China and India. Eschewing the cuisine minceur role for the state adopted by Blair and Brown, he has proposed no less than a new \"agency of industrial innovation\" that will promote the \"national champions\" of tomorrow in the manner of Airbus in aerospace or Ariane in space technology. Chirac, drawing on plans presented to him by Jean-Louis Beffa, the chairman and chief executive of St Gobain, the glassmaker, has come up with the idea of 10 \"programmes of mobilisation for industrial innovation.\" These include the clean (non-polluting) car, solar energy, new treatments for infectious or neuro-degenerative diseases and secure broadband networks. The new agency will be given at least €2bn over the next three years but, unlike previous examples, including Britain's ill-fated National Enterprise Board under Jim Callaghan, it promises to avoid simply being an executive arm of the state, chucking taxpayers' money at picked-out winners-or, worse, pouring it into ill-conceived and badly executed R&amp;D programmes and investment schemes dreamed up in the board rooms of nationalised industries run by énarques (graduates of France's grandes écoles such as the national administration college). Before City analysts or Treasury wonks dismiss the Chirac plans as Bonapartist folly, they merit a moment of examination. The Beffa scheme endorsed by the president sees the agency funded on a 50:50 basis by the state and private sector, with the state's share largely coming from privatisation receipts (EDF and nuclear operator Areva, say) which would normally go to reducing public debt and the budget deficit. Public money would be repayable, moreover. Large companies or a cluster of small and medium-sized firms would be in charge of both R&amp;D and investment in new programmes and products which, supposedly, would gear France away from its traditional success in autos or airframes into new territories such as information technology or bioscience. State aid would be more concentrated and, with an eye to EU rules, would be less than €100,000 (£70,000) over three years for any one firm. So, unlike Nicolas Sarkozy's rescue of Alstom last year, the aim would be to take risks for the future - a French version of Japan's MITI, perhaps. Where New Labour has allowed neo-Thatcherite-style, foreign groups to take over many of Britain's industrial crown jewels and would not blink an eye if the Chinese or Indians acquired, say, AstraZeneca, Chirac wants to invite other European countries and firms, especially German, to join his new agency. He wants the Franco-German axis to seize control of the EU's so-called Lisbon strategy to surpass the US by 2010 as \"the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world ....\" - due to be revised and updated this spring. Scoffers might point out, drawing on the recent Kok report, that the US accounts for three-quarters of the top 300 IT companies and almost half of the top 300 ranked by R&amp;D spend or that America is simply better at making productivity gains through innovation. But Airbus has proved that, with government backing, it can out-compete Boeing in the marketplace and in new technology. The Chirac plan is bold; it may be flawed. But then there's no reason why Europe should just do nothing - leaving the field clear for the Americans or the new Asian giants to clean up. Old-fashioned That said, there was more evidence yesterday that the French are still far too ready to adopt old-fashioned protectionist remedies in the face of immediate threats from globalisation. Ubisoft, the French video games firm, found an unwanted investor on its share register just before Christmas in the form of Electronic Arts, the big US games group, which has picked up a 20% stake. Almost immediately this has triggered speculation that Vivendi, the fantastical telecommunications to entertainment group forged by Jean-Marie Messier, might race to the rescue, merging its own games business with Ubisoft to create one of those French \"national champions.\" The trouble with this idea is that if it made any sense, the merger would surely have happened already - especially when Vivendi Universal Games has been up for sale for at least two years. What's more, the VUG business managed to lose a heroic €185m in the first nine months of last year, on turnover of €211m. Putting it together with Ubisoft may well produce something poisonous enough to repel Electronic Arts, but it would penalise shareholders in both companies. Ubisoft's investors - many of them international - would have their interests subjugated to those of the French state, being denied top open-market dollar for their stock. And at Vivendi, which had supposedly declared video games as a \"non-core\" sector, shareholders have simply suffered enough nonsense over the years.",
        "debiased_text": "French President Jacques Chirac has proposed a plan to transform France's economy and industrial base over the next decade, aiming to enhance competitiveness relative to the United States, China, and India. The plan includes the creation of a new 'agency of industrial innovation' to support emerging industries, modeled after successes like Airbus and Ariane. The agency would focus on sectors such as clean cars, solar energy, medical treatments, and secure broadband networks. It is expected to receive at least €2 billion in funding over the next three years, with financing split equally between public and private sources. Public funds would primarily come from privatization proceeds, such as from EDF and Areva, and would be repayable. The initiative seeks to encourage large companies or groups of smaller firms to lead research, development, and investment in new technologies while complying with EU state aid rules, limiting support to under €100,000 per firm over three years. Chirac also aims to involve other European countries, particularly Germany, in the effort, aligning with the EU's Lisbon strategy for economic competitiveness. Meanwhile, speculation has arisen regarding Ubisoft, a French video game company, after Electronic Arts acquired a 20% stake. Some suggest Vivendi might merge its gaming division with Ubisoft to create a stronger French competitor, though such a move could raise financial and shareholder concerns."

        "original_text": "The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $54.99 billion in March from the previous month, as American consumers pulled back sharply on purchases of foreign-made merchandise and shipments of apparel from China slowed. For the month, imports of goods and services decreased $4.05 billion, or 2.5%, to $157.19 billion, amid slackened demand for overseas consumer goods such as appliances and big-ticket items such as autos, the Commerce Department reported. Fueling the decline in imports -- and helping to pull down the overall deficit -- was a 21.2% drop in Chinese-made textile imports. Imports of everything from yarns and thread to trousers and blouses fell. At the same time, U.S. shipments abroad of capital goods, such as civilian aircraft and telecommunications equipment, and food products, such as soybeans and corn, pushed exports in March up $1.52 billion, or 1.5%, to $102.20 billion. Overall, the deficit for March was down 9.2% from the revised record $60.57 billion trade gap posted in February; it was the narrowest monthly gap since September 2004. The dollar strengthened against other currencies after the release of the Commerce data. The shrinkage in the deficit, significantly, suggested the government's preliminary estimate of a 3.1% annualized growth rate in gross domestic product for the first quarter of 2005 will likely be revised upward at the end of the month. The Commerce Department had foreseen the sharp drop in the trade deficit in March when making the initial calculation of first-quarter growth, analysts said. Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst for MG Financial Group in New York, said the new trade numbers could push estimates of growth for the quarter into the range of 3.7% to 3.9%. It is unclear why imports from China fell so sharply. \"Something is going on,\" said Peter Morici, a business professor at the University of Maryland. \"Either Wal-Mart and others are diversifying to other points in Asia, or Chinese officials are starting to take administrative action of some kind to avoid a real revaluation.\" Other analysts suggested the date of the Chinese New Year may have produced an anomalous decline in imports. The holiday came in February this year. Many businesses in Asia shut for an entire week during the period, creating disruptions in shipments that might not have been picked up in U.S. import data until March. Even with the drop, though, the U.S. trade deficit for the year is on pace to eclipse the record of $617.07 billion posted for all of 2004. For the first three months of 2005, the trade deficit came in at $174.06 billion, more than $30 billion higher the accumulated deficit for the same period last year. David Rosenberg, Merrill Lynch's chief North American economist, suggested \"the first quarter as a whole . . . represented a notable drag on GDP growth.\" Once again, the nation's widest trade deficit with any single country was with China. Notably, the gap with China narrowed for a second straight month, falling nearly $1 billion to $12.9 billion in March. The decline was largely the result of a decline in imports, including apparel and textile products.",

Following the report, the dollar strengthened against other currencies, and analysts noted that the deficit reduction may lead to an upward revision of the first-quarter 2005 GDP growth estimate from the initial 3.1% projection. Some analysts speculated that the decline in Chinese imports could relate to diversified sourcing by U.S. retailers or the timing of the Chinese New Year, which fell in February and may have delayed shipments. Despite the March decrease, the cumulative trade deficit for the first three months of 2005 was $174.06 billion, exceeding the same period in 2004 by more than $30 billion. The U.S. trade deficit with China narrowed for the second consecutive month, declining to $12.9 billion in March, primarily due to reduced imports of apparel and textiles."

        "original_text": "WASHINGTON -- For the third time in a week, the Bush administration increased economic pressure on Beijing, moving to impose more restrictions on imports of Chinese-made textiles and apparel. A federal task force led by the Commerce Department announced its decision to extend import limits to four more categories of textiles, including combed-cotton yarn and certain knit shirts, in an effort to protect U.S. producers from the import surge that began after the first of the year. The quotas are designed to cap imports that would jump without the government controls. They will take effect this month, after the administration formally requests consultations with China on ending disruption of the U.S. market. For each category of textiles subject to the decision, the quota levels -- or import controls -- will be 7.5% above the amount of imports of those products from China during the past 12 months. Gao Yong, deputy chairman of the China National Textile & Apparel Council, said, \"We strongly reject the new sanctions on Chinese textile export imposed by the U.S. government. The safeguard measures, including those imposed on the three categories last week, are not in line with the free trade principles of WTO.\" But a Chinese Commerce Ministry official suggested yesterday morning in Beijing following the U.S. announcement of the new measures, that China still plans to impose some voluntary restrictions on its textile exports. \"What we do is for the long-term interest of China,\" she said. \"The sanctions by the U.S. government will have limited impact on our own schedule.\" She declined to provide any details of China's planned measures, but said there will be an official announcement \"pretty soon.\" Many industry executives said they expect the measures to be in the form of higher tariffs on certain textile exports. The 7.5% caps are considered tight, and drew objections from retailers. Still, Cass Johnson, president of the National Council of Textile Organizations, a trade group, said the curbs will \"save thousands of textile jobs that are at immediate risk from subsidized Chinese imports.\" Beijing has protested the curbs, as have American retailers with manufacturing operations in China. Laura Jones, executive director of the U.S. Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel, a group representing major retailers, called the move \"outrageous and unjustified.\" The announcement builds on action taken Friday to curb shipments of Chinese clothing in three core categories and reflects more assertiveness by the Bush administration in dealing with Beijing on economic issues. This week, the White House raised pressure on Beijing to allow the yuan to strengthen against the dollar. Overall, the value of Chinese imports in the first quarter ran 54% ahead of the same period in 2004. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said yesterday's \"announcement demonstrates this administration's continued commitment to America's textile manufacturers and their employees.\" --- Qiu Haixu in Beijing contributed to this article.",

        "original_text": "One wonders if fame is going to Lang Lang's head. At 22, he is already, we are told, \"the subject of a bestselling biography in China\". His Festival Hall recital, meanwhile, was laid out along autobiographical lines, as intimated in the programme. Liszt's Second Hungarian Rhapsody was the piece that inspired him to become a pianist. \"I heard it for the first time, aged two, on the TV,\" he says, comparing it to the soundtrack for a Tom and Jerry cartoon - a thought to make your average Lisztian run screaming for cover. Age is perhaps catching up with him, however, for he informs us that you need to play Schumann's Kinderszenen \"as if you're getting old and trying to remember your youth\". The piece that testified best to his strengths and weaknesses on this occasion was Chopin's Third Sonata, which he writes about least. He's a superb technician, combining grace with power. The sonata's scherzo was a model of mercurial brilliance, its largo perfect in its fluidity. Against that, however, must be set his apparent unwillingness to think in terms of larger musical paragraphs or cumulative drama. The opening movement, juxtaposing austerity with heightened lyricism, came close to shapelessness. The disparity between technique and depth was apparent throughout. Mozart's Sonata in C K330 was elegant but dry. Kinderszenen had plenty of beguiling charm, but missed the darker point that adult creativity is rooted in the fears and fantasies of childhood. Liszt's notorious Hungarian Rhapsody was staggering, but Lang preceded it with a performance of Petrarch Sonnet 104 from Années de Pèlerinage that was hit and miss in its emotional range. Lang has, of course, done important work in drawing a young audience to classical music, and his teenage fans cheered him on throughout. Whether he manages to find the interpretative power to match his virtuosity, however, remains to be seen.",

        "original_text": "brucegarvey@rogers.com\nIt was in the Seventies that the late Liberal prime minister and Canadian icon Pierre Trudeau had the hare-brained idea of slashing our huge trading relationship with the United States, replacing much of it with a trans-Atlantic trade deal with Europe.\nHe called it the \"third option\" -- some kind of Canadian sovereignty association with the European Common Market as it was at the time -- and of course it came to nothing.\nSeveral years later, Jean Chretien vowed in an election campaign to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement negotiated by Brian Mulroney if he won. He did. But of course, the promise -- just like scrapping the GST -- also came to nothing.\nGiven this Liberal heritage, it should come as no surprise that here is Paul Martin, threatening to retaliate against American intransigence on softwood lumber by diverting our energy and resource exports to markets in China and India rather than the U.S.\nWell, make no mistake about it, this is serious business, the kind of escalation that flirts with the very real prospect of a wider trade war, one that can only provoke and infuriate even moderate Americans, never mind the hard-pressed Bush administration.\nIncredibly, it's coming from the man who formed a government vowing that he would repair the damage of the Chretien years and restore good relations with Washington. And it's no slip of the tongue. It's a concerted campaign involving Martin's choice as Canadian ambassador to Washington Frank McKenna who recently went out of his way to scorn the American government as \"in large measure dysfunctional.\"\nAs his opposite number David Wilkins was quick to point out, it's not apparent how this trash talk helps resolve trade disputes.\n\"It is sometimes politically popular to criticize the United States,\" he said two weeks ago. \"It's not lost on me that Canada is in an election year mode now ... I don't think it gets us anywhere.\"\nFor Martin, the political prize is a handful of left-leaning seats in B.C. and Ontario, which the Liberals believe could be lost to the NDP. For McKenna, the lure is to take over when Martin falters.\nAs many a state governor has often proved, you can't go wrong running against Washington.\nMartin ratcheted up the war of words in deliberate and ominous fashion -- a speech to the Economic Club of New York last week and a meeting with the Wall Street Journal editorial board, which has been supportive of Canada's softwood lumber position.\nAll this after hosting the Chinese president in Ottawa, and blatantly soft-pedaling our objections to Beijing's human rights violations.\nAnd now, just to prove the Liberals aren't bluffing, here goes the most hapless member of the lacklustre Liberal Cabinet, John McCallum, off to China less than a month into his natural resources portfolio. This is the same John McCallum who, as defence minister, didn't know the difference between Vimy and Vichy; and last week bungled his way through a ridiculous defence of a rich severance package for double-dipper David Dingwall, pledging fidelity to non- existent labour laws in the process.\nAccording to McCallum, Canada now has a \"strategic partnership with China,\" whatever that means. This may come as news to Washington, which has officially designated the Chinese a \"strategic competitor.\"\nAny way you slice it, you don't have to be Henry Kissinger to figure out that the next economic and military superpower confrontation will be between the U.S. and China.\nBy then, according to the apparent Martin strategy, China will have replaced the United States as our biggest customer for oil, gas, softwood lumber and whatever other natural resources we can tempt them with.\nNone of this suggests the protectionist U.S. position on lumber is acceptable. However, escalating a trade tiff into a trade war offers no benefit other than political pandering to the traditional Liberal anti-American streak. The only sane move would appear to have been suggested by Stephen Harper: appoint a couple of top flight special envoys to sit down and resolve the dispute mechanism once and for all.\nThere is one nightmare scenario that has haunted anyone with a semblance of wit since 9/11 -- the prospect of the U.S. slamming the border shut over some security breach. In an instant, there goes the Canadian economy.\nTo think that this could happen over $5-billion worth of duties owed to profitable, if not booming, forestry companies is unthinkable.\nAnd for Martin to blithely fantasize about replacing our common North American heritage with some strategic soul mate partnership with China is the height of irresponsibility.\nSpeaking of which, where does the Martin family shipping company build its new tankers? You guessed it -- China. Just sayin'.",
        "debiased_text": "In the 1970s, then-Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau proposed shifting a significant portion of Canada's trade relations from the United States to Europe through a trans-Atlantic trade deal with the European Common Market, referred to as the 'third option.' The initiative did not materialize. Later, Jean Chrétien campaigned on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) under Brian Mulroney but did not follow through after winning the election. Currently, Paul Martin's government has indicated it may redirect energy and resource exports to China and India in response to unresolved softwood lumber disputes with the U.S. This stance has drawn attention amid concerns about potential trade tensions. Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Frank McKenna recently described the American government as 'in large measure dysfunctional,' a comment that U.S. Ambassador David Wilkins suggested may not aid dispute resolution. The Martin administration hosted Chinese President Hu Jintao in Ottawa and has signaled closer economic ties with China, including discussions of a 'strategic partnership.' Natural Resources Minister John McCallum visited China to explore trade opportunities, though his previous public statements have been subjects of scrutiny. While the U.S. maintains a protectionist position on softwood lumber, critics argue that escalating disagreements could have broader economic consequences. Conservative leader Stephen Harper has proposed appointing special envoys to mediate the dispute. Some analysts note potential risks to Canada-U.S. relations, particularly regarding border security and economic interdependence. The Martin family’s shipping company, Canada Steamship Lines, has commissioned new tankers from Chinese shipbuilders."

        "original_text": "No matter what Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schroder may say, it's clear that European defense contractors plan to follow George Bush's lead and maintain the arms embargo on China. Mike Turner, the CEO of British firm BAE Systems, Europe's largest defense company, said his company \"will do nothing that will jeopardize our position with the U. S. They are a very, very important customer.\" EADS, the Franco- German conglomerate, has made similar statements. Dassault of France, which makes the Rafale fighter jet coveted by Beijing, said \"military sales to China are not on the agenda.\" It's not hard to figure out why. The United States spends as much money on defense as the rest of the world combined, and there's still room for more. Homeland Security programs have bolstered demand for things like helicopters and electronic security equipment. \"The European firms have to choose between the U.S. and China,\" says Andrew Dorman, a defense expert at King's College London. That so many of Europe's top firms are following America's lead might seem an embarrassment to Brussels. The reality is more complicated. Last December, when the European Council announced its intention to lift the embargo, it also stated that the result should be neither a \"quantitative nor qualitative\" increase of arms exports to China. So why lift the ban if that has no impact? The embargo was imposed in 1989 after the Tiananmen massacre, and the Chinese \"understandably, don't like being lumped in\" with other embargoed countries like Burma and Zimbabwe, says Emma Udwin, an EU spokesperson. \"This is about removing... an irritant to EU-Chinese relations.\" But will Beijing be satisfied with a mere gesture? European officials seem confident that China will take the long view, and see lifting the embargo as a good start. A U.S. congressional analyst agrees: to date China has been buying most of its imported fighters and subs from Russia, and has no plans to buy the \"big stuff\" from Europe, anyway. What concerns Washington is the transfer of technology, like command-and-control systems. China has already committed 200 million euro to the Galileo satellite navigation system, Europe's answer to America's Global Positioning System. Brussels is trying to soothe U.S. fears with a new code of conduct for EU exports to China. But the document doesn't clearly cover many items of concern, such as \"dual-use\" equipment that could have either commercial or military applications. Meanwhile, Congress is preparing to rule on British access to sensitive military technologies, and whether Boeing or EADS will get a major new Air Force tanker contract. No wonder Europe's defense companies are listening to Bush.",
        "debiased_text": "European defense contractors plan to maintain the arms embargo on China, aligning with the U.S. position. Mike Turner, CEO of BAE Systems, stated that the company prioritizes its relationship with the U.S., a significant customer. EADS and Dassault of France have also indicated that military sales to China are not currently a focus. The U.S. defense market remains a major driver for these firms due to its scale and demand for security equipment. Andrew Dorman, a defense expert at King's College London, noted that European companies face a choice between the U.S. and Chinese markets. The European Council previously proposed lifting the embargo in December but emphasized that this should not lead to increased arms exports to China. The embargo was established in 1989 following events in Tiananmen Square. Emma Udwin, an EU spokesperson, explained that removing the embargo could reduce tensions in EU-China relations. China currently sources most of its imported military equipment from Russia and has not indicated plans to purchase major systems from Europe. The U.S. has expressed concerns about technology transfers, including participation in projects like the Galileo satellite system. The EU has proposed a new export code of conduct to address these concerns, though some dual-use technologies remain undefined. Congressional decisions on British access to U.S. military technologies and contracts for companies like Boeing and EADS may also influence European defense firms."

        "original_text": "Train of thought Step forward, Charles Clarke, environmental pioneer. What has the home secretary done to deserve such an accolade? He took the train to Brussels. Once. Wow! It might not sound much, but it's a whole lot better than his ministerial colleagues. The Liberal Democrats' green spokesman, Norman Baker, has examined the details of ministerial travel, released in the summer. Of 42 official trips to Brussels from April 2004 to March 2005, a carbon-heavy 41 were made by air. Clarke was the only one to let the Eurostar take the strain. Zero rated When Tony Blair opened the ambitious CIS solar tower in the centre of Manchester last week he was full of praise for solar energy. Little did he know that the Department of Trade and Industry would, just 48 hours later, close the book on all community solar and other micro-renewable projects. Schools, village halls and others wanting support for solar hot water, or for wind power, will now have to wait at least six months until the next (smaller) round of grants becomes available. On the other hand, everyone can take comfort from the government's exhortations to China to invest more in zero-carbon and low-carbon technologies. Wailing for whales Even as Norway's \"scientific\" whaling season closes, with 639 minke whales killed, the Japanese fleet has waved two fingers to the world and set off to the southern ocean to kill 935. If this were not enough to enrage hundreds of environment and animal groups, Japan says it intends also to kill 10 endangered fin whales this year in what it called \"feasibility\" research. This will be upped next year to 50, along with 50 even more endangered humpback whales. The Australian government - no slouch in the past when it came to whaling - is furious. \"This is more than science - these are commercial quantities of whales,\" says Ian Campbell, the minister for the environment. Fat chance It beats flipping burgers, but only just. The University of Portsmouth is looking for a graduate to help its civil engineers tackle the fatty waste poured into the sewers by fast-food joints. Water companies spend £25m each year treating problems caused when restaurants tip hot fat down the sink. The lucky PhD candidate will spend time at Petersfield sewage works looking at ways to unclog the pipes, and will be given \"special training to deal with working in confined spaces\". Claustrophobics need not apply. Cross purposes Six months ago, a betting man might have put money on Transport for London powering through approval for its £500m Thames gateway bridge. But the odds may have shortened last week when the inquiry heard that the 2001 traffic figures on which TfL's case was based are wildly out. New TfL research demanded by Bexley, an objecting council, shows that traffic in many places likely to be affected has more than doubled in four years, suggesting there will be more pollution and congestion if the bridge is built. Friends of the Earth, Transport 2000 and locals say they are outraged. Tfl is having to rethink. Abandon ship BNFL has long admitted that even its own experts don't know what is in its noxious fuel storage ponds at Sellafield, but they can now be sure about one piece of nuclear waste rotting away down there: a submarine. In an inspired move that could slash years off the clean-up effort, BNFL's engineers sent the robot sub in to survey one of the ponds. Peering through the murky waters, it found some spent fuel, which was then dug out for storage - the first such retrieval for 15 years. The sub's reward? To be reclassified as nuclear waste. Now it can't come out again. Cor, slimy! A Greenpeace study last week found that European eels from 20 rivers and lakes in 10 countries contained residues of at least one brominated flame retardant (BFR) - nasty toxic manmade chemicals - and that the levels found in Thames eels were by far the highest. All of which spells bad news for the pearly kings and queens - those admirable cockneys who dress up in sequins and eat jellied eels. \"If they're poisonous, it would stop a lot of people eating them, and that wouldn't be on,\" says Carole Jolly, spokeswoman for the Pearly Society in London. \"They should stop using these chemicals. Eels are a very hardy fish, and if they're being affected, then everything will be affected.\"",

The company said it had revenue of $46 million last year. Any move by Yahoo would come as U.S. Internet companies are preparing to take big risks to retain or expand their Chinese footholds. Google Inc. last month said it planned to open a product research and development center in China. EBay appears to be steadily losing market share to Alibaba's TaoBao, and has pledged to pour $100 million into the market. Yahoo entered China in 1999, but local portals gained market share.

        "original_text": "Bashar Assad is in a box from which he cannot escape, western diplomats say, after UN investigators implicated senior regime figures in February's murder of the Lebanese politician, Rafik Hariri. But while Syria's president is no Houdini, rumours of his imminent political demise appear exaggerated. One reason is international divisions about what to do. The US and Britain want swift UN action, leading to possible sanctions. But France's foreign minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, said yesterday that any decision-making should be left until the UN inquiry was complete. Damascus has credible grounds for hoping that Russia and China will oppose western-initiated punitive action through the UN, as has been the case with other \"states of concern\" such as Sudan, Burma and Zimbabwe. And Washington may yet be distracted by a bigger target. Stephen Hadley, the US national security adviser, was in Moscow yesterday seeking Russian support for UN action against Iran. The Syrian dossier barely got a mention. \"I expect the UN security council will only issue a warning this week,\" said Rime Allaf, a Syria expert at the thinktank Chatham House. \"But if the UN inquiry's final report on December 15 says regime figures should be handed over, Assad will be in a very difficult position.\" Syria's leader has other options. He would play for time and to the Arab gallery, Ms Allaf suggested, presenting his country to the Muslim world as the latest victim of a familiar American antipathy. That is already happening. Syria rejected the UN report as politically motivated; at the same time, the foreign ministry dangled the possibility of increased cooperation. And the war for Arab ears has already begun. Mass pro-government demonstrations in Damascus and Aleppo yesterday illustrated the leadership's determination to mobilise regional opinion in support of what is being portrayed as a confrontation with the US as much as the UN. \"Wake up Arabs, your turn will come soon!\" said one banner. The officially organised protests were a reminder that despite public dissatisfaction over living standards, 20% unemployment, and falling oil income, the regime still knows how to exploit nationalist sentiment - and faces little conventional political opposition. Mr Assad's second line of defence follows the Gaullist model: \"Après moi, le deluge.\" This posits that there is no obvious or acceptable successor to the ruling Ba'athists, that he and his late father, Hafez Assad, have succeeded in holding together an ethnically and confessionally disparate country, and that civil war merging with Iraq's could ensue if the regime fell. Malik al-Abdeh, spokesman for the exiled Movement for Justice and Development opposition party, said such dire eventualities could not be ignored. \"The Sunni Salafist movement with its jihadist offshoots is a growing force within Syria, especially among the rural young,\" he said. \"This movement is not under the influence of traditional Islamist parties like the Muslim Brotherhood. It is a relatively new phenomenon, greatly boosted by the Iraq insurgency... it represents the strongest challenge to the regime on the ground.\" But Mr Abdeh argued that was a reason to replace Mr Assad, not tolerate him. The US wanted \"a more seasoned and pragmatic politician than Bashar\" to confront the Islamists, he claimed. Ms Allaf disagreed. \"The Americans are buying into the deluge argument,\" she said. \"They have stopped hinting at regime change. I think a number of countries are telling them this is not the time - even the Israelis. It's in their interest to have a weakened Syria, a Syria on its knees, but not a Syria in chaos.\" If all else fails, Mr Assad'could offer a deal involving concessions on Iraq, Lebanon and support for Palestinian militants. But while that might satisfy the US, it could be too much for his Alawite godfathers. In that case, regime change may come not from without but from within.",
        "debiased_text": "Western diplomats have stated that Bashar Assad faces significant challenges after UN investigators implicated senior Syrian officials in the February killing of Lebanese politician Rafik Hariri.

The U.S. and Britain advocate for swift UN action, including potential sanctions, while France's foreign minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, suggested waiting until the UN inquiry concludes before making decisions. Syria may rely on opposition from Russia and China to block Western-led punitive measures at the UN, as seen in cases involving other nations such as Sudan, Burma, and Zimbabwe. Meanwhile, U.S. national security adviser Stephen Hadley was in Moscow seeking Russian support for UN action against Iran, with little discussion on Syria. Analysts, including Rime Allaf of Chatham House, anticipate the UN Security Council may issue a warning this week. A final UN report on December 15 could place Assad in a difficult position if it recommends transferring implicated regime figures. Syria has rejected the UN report as politically motivated while signaling possible increased cooperation. Pro-government demonstrations in Damascus and Aleppo highlighted efforts to frame the situation as a confrontation with the U.S. and UN. The regime continues to leverage nationalist sentiment despite domestic economic challenges. Assad’s position is also bolstered by concerns over succession and stability, with some warning that his removal could lead to civil conflict, particularly given the influence of Sunni Salafist movements. Opponents argue that addressing Islamic extremism requires leadership change, but others, including Allaf, note that international actors, including Israel, prefer a weakened but stable Syria over chaos. Assad may seek to negotiate concessions on Iraq, Lebanon, and Palestinian militant support, though such moves could face resistance from within his own government."

China's trade surplus in 2004 was $31.98 billion, the highest in six years, with exports rising 35% to $593.36 billion. Sinosure was established in December 2001, merging the export credit insurance departments of Export-Import Bank of China and People's Insurance Co. of China."

        "original_text": "No more will we go a-Rovering, neither up and down motorways, nor in and out of National Trust car parks, it seems. The once blimpishly British cars with the Victorian dog's name and Viking longship badge, which first turned a wheel in 1904, have all but gone the way of Alvis and Riley, Austin and Wolseley, Armstrong-Siddeley and Jowett: into the lock-ups, and even the crusher, of motoring history. Rover cars of recent years have been odd things, pear-shaped or carriage clock-like machines, some with surprisingly powerful engines and beefy suspension, supported fiercely, even threateningly, by loyal fans in the west Midlands, but nowhere much else. Rover fans have been at their Anglo-Saxon angriest when what they see as the world's greatest cars - the Rover 25, 75 and MG XPower SV roadster (a busty, computer-graphic-style muscle car all too easily imagined bursting priapically from posters on teenage boys' bedroom walls) - are compared unfavourably with BMWs. For theirs are the foreign cars that effectively ousted Rover saloons from the concreted-over gardens of suburban streets the length and breadth of Britain. And, yet, at the very beginning of Britain's motorway age, Rover was a force to be reckoned with. Its crisp new P6 2000 model, styled by David Bache, stole a march on the new generation of fast middle-class BMWs only just emerging from Munich. It was a brilliant design that put the wind up Jaguar. Although post-war Rovers had been big, comfortable, beautifully made club-like cars for senior civil servants, chartered accountants, headmasters and bank managers, the company has been no slouch in progressive and even radical design. Not only was Rover a part of the story of the development of the jet engine, it pioneered the jet-propelled, or gas-turbine, car. The Dan Dare-style Jet 1 of 1950 - with the roof cut off, twin-set and pearls cast aside and hair sleeked down - was a real corker, a dream car celebrated time and again in the colour pages of fair-play boys' comics such as Boys' Own and The Eagle. British was surely best. Rover had, in fact, innovated from the very start, when John Kemp Stanley, a Coventry cycle mechanic in business with William Sutton, launched his revolutionary Rover Safety bicycle in 1885. Equipped with a chain-driven rear wheel, gears and pneumatic tyres, it ousted the Penny Farthing while breaking every record going. The class-winning Land Rover, a British Jeep designed by Gordon Bashford and endorsed by Winston Churchill, appeared in 1948; Spen King's equally brilliant Range Rover in 1970. A prototype E-type-eating sports car, the fabulous P6BS wowed the motoring press in the mid-1960s. A lightweight Buick V8 engine shoehorned beneath the bonnets of P5 and P6 models gave Rover saloons road-burning clout, while in 1976 the Ferrari Daytona-lookalike SD1 saloon wowed motorway police patrols and would have been a world-beater if it hadn't been for the poor manufacturing standards synonymous with British Leyland, the glum conglomerate which swallowed Rover in 1968. In the mid-1980s the new Rover Group brought out its fishy-looking 800 model, which was effectively a Honda by another name, and Rover somehow lost its way. Although Rover's engineers have since produced fine engines and other components for successful sports cars, such as the whizzy little Caterham Seven, the most British of all cars in an era in which bling-bling Bentleys are top-range Volkswagens and Rolls-Royces dread BMWs, their work has been very much, perhaps too much, behind the scenes. Rover appears to have struggled with design and business since the 80s; in truth, perhaps it has been floundering ever since British Leyland did its best to wreck its reputation nearly 40 years ago. The name, owned by big bad BMW, may yet reappear on a future generation of well-engineered cars. For many of us, though, Rover will for ever be a handsome, two-tone, six-cylinder P4 model - the \"Aunty Rover\" - of the late 50s or early 60s, a refined upright machine as stately as a galleon with a cocktail dash of American styling somewhere in the mix, thrumming contentedly along the kind of A-road that leads inexorably to half-timbered houses, Rotary clubs and gin'n'tonic golf clubs via thatched petrol stations and masonic lodges, but never remotely to the fast roadsigned \"21st century\", much less the one to China.",
        "debiased_text": "Rover, a British car manufacturer established in 1904, has seen its presence diminish significantly in recent decades. The brand, known for models such as the Rover 25, 75, and MG XPower SV roadster, faced competition from foreign manufacturers like BMW, which gained popularity in the UK. Rover had earlier successes, including the P6 2000 model designed by David Bache, which competed with emerging BMW models in the 1960s. Post-war Rover vehicles were often favored by professionals such as civil servants and bank managers. The company also contributed to automotive innovation, including the development of the Rover Safety bicycle in 1885 and the introduction of the Land Rover in 1948 and Range Rover in 1970. A prototype sports car, the P6BS, received positive attention in the mid-1960s. However, manufacturing issues under British Leyland, which acquired Rover in 1968, affected the brand's reputation. The Rover Group released the Honda-derived 800 model in the 1980s, marking a shift in the brand's direction. While Rover engineers have continued to produce components for sports cars like the Caterham Seven, the company has faced challenges in design and business strategy. The Rover name, now owned by BMW, may potentially reappear on future vehicles."

        "original_text": "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Zhou Wenzhong was on the road again, this time in central Iowa, which he calls \"a heart state.\" A silk scarf tossed over his shoulder, the new Chinese ambassador to the U.S. came to fiddle with wooden turkey callers and sniff animal-feed additives, while touting China as a land of opportunity that just wants to be America's friend. It's a hefty challenge, but Mr. Zhou picked his latest destination -- the third state he's visited in four weeks -- with pinpoint care. He came to Iowa, he says, \"because this is where America's political battles are settled.\" One morning on his three-day visit, he traveled with aides in a minibus for a five-hour roundtrip to Cedar Rapids, the district of Rep. James Leach, a Republican who chairs the Asian subcommittee within the House International Relations committee. \"It is important to have friends, especially out here,\" said the 60- year-old Mr. Zhou (pronounced \"Joe\"), as he passed grain silos and shorn corn fields on a late autumn drive. After years of often ham-handed diplomacy, China is trying as never before to win friends and influence people, not just in Des Moines but in Denver, Schenectady, N.Y., Minneapolis -- and above all, Washington. The reasons are clear. China must maintain its scorching economic growth to pull its massive population out of poverty and become more of a global power. To do that, it must keep the peace with the U.S., its largest trading partner and the catalyst for millions of its jobs. China has gone through a rough patch with the U.S. in the past few months, raising concerns in Beijing and making Mr. Zhou's job all the more urgent. Both sides have been scrambling to mend frayed edges in preparation for President Bush's meetings this weekend in Beijing with Chinese President Hu Jintao. But tensions between the world's sole superpower and its fastest rising new power aren't fading. The Pentagon warned this summer that China's military buildup could upset the balance of power in Asia. In August, an impassioned Congress effectively killed a proposed takeover of California's Unocal Corp. by Chinese oil and gas company Cnooc Ltd. U.S. lawmakers are threatening to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports unless Beijing moves further to revalue its currency. Mr. Zhou says his job is \"to increase the ups\" in a relationship plagued by many ups and downs. \"Most important,\" he says, \"is that we're seen as a friend and not as a rival.\" U.S. diplomats and lawmakers well remember that China, as recently as the late 1990s, would berate the U.S. as \"the global hegemon\" for meddling in other countries' affairs. At low moments, such as after the downing of a U.S. surveillance plane over China in 2001, the testiness cropped up. Even today, Chinese diplomats still march into the State Department to deliver formal letters of protest over U.S.- Taiwan policy or criticism of China's treatment of the Falun Gong spiritual sect. U.S. officials complain that private sessions with the Chinese remain overly formal, with too many prepared texts. But China is at last showing some diplomatic flair as it tries to tweak U.S. opinion. \"China's diplomats have gotten a lot more confident and a lot more sophisticated,\" says Joseph Prueher, former U.S. ambassador to Beijing, whose term put him at the center of the bitter spat over the downed U.S. spy plane. The Chinese government, partly to counter Taiwan's own well-fueled public-relations juggernaut in the U.S., has begun to hire high-priced lobbyists and is bringing in a younger, savvier crop of diplomats to work the halls of the U.S. Congress. Its embassy is reaching out to Washington's many think tanks to solicit guidance, while top diplomats like Ambassador Zhou also work the hinterlands. China's embassy itself will soon become a symbol of the country's new presence in Washington: Since 1979, when the countries normalized relations, Chinese diplomats have worked out of a dreary former hotel. But in April, China broke ground on a new embassy, designed by I.M. Pei and expected to be the city's largest when finished in 2008. Part of the charm offensive is cultural. China is promoting the teaching of Mandarin in U.S. schools, and the construction of pagodas, Chinese cultural centers and Asian gardens in U.S. cities. Last month, Beijing sponsored a Festival of China at Washington's Kennedy Center, flying in 800 ballet dancers, acrobats, musicians and singers. It cost China's government $2 million. Chinese Culture Minister Sun Jiazheng told a gathering of U.S. executives and diplomats that the festival had a central message: \"That China brings to America love and not threat.\" He told interviewer Charlie Rose that China wants the American and Chinese people to \"have a mind-to-mind talk.\" Beijing has also begun aggressively seeking friends in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. That, at times, complicates attempts to foster warmer ties with the U.S., especially with outreach to countries that have estranged relations with the U.S., such as Iran and Venezuela. Yet China has shown a nimbleness in dealing with major irritants in its U.S. relations. In July, Beijing slightly revalued its currency, after months of U.S. cajoling. Last week, it agreed to a three-year limit on some textile exports to the U.S. China has also become more active within organizations such as the United Nations, where for years it was a famous abstainer on key resolutions. The British-educated Mr. Zhou, who arrived in Washington in April, has taken a distinctly retail approach to the job. He set the goal of meeting with all 535 members of Congress, though he declines to offer a running tally. He wants to visit all 50 states as ambassador, and has at least 40 to go. (He traveled extensively in the U.S. during earlier, more junior postings in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington.) Mr. Zhou was often the blunt deliverer of bad news to U.S. diplomats in the past. As ambassador to Australia in 1999, he warned the U.S. it didn't have carte blanche to intervene in other countries' affairs for human-rights reasons, saying Washington's \"Kosovo formula\" for imposing rules on the former Yugoslavia could never apply to Taiwan. He was China's deputy foreign minister in 2001, when a Chinese fighter plane crashed after colliding with a U.S. spy plane. The Chinese pilot was killed and the U.S. plane was forced to land in China. Mr. Zhou repeatedly issued Beijing's demand that President Bush apologize. \"The United States,\" he said, \"should face reality, take responsibility and apologize to China.\" President Bush eventually did send a letter saying the U.S. was sorry for both the death of a Chinese pilot and that the U.S. plane had entered Chinese airspace without permission. Yet in Washington he's become a champion listener, and an example of China's subtler approach to foreign policy. At the height of the furor over Cnooc's bid for Unocal, Mr. Zhou went to a dinner with representatives of about 20 major corporations at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington. For 21/2 hours, the guests showered him with complaints and concerns about China, ranging from brand theft to discriminatory tax rules. The ambassador diligently scribbled notes. \"It was a tough-love message, and he was there to receive it,\" said Myron Brilliant, the Chamber's top Asia hand. \"He didn't fight it or argue, but simply said he would take it back to China.\" Not long after, U.S. officials say, Ambassador Zhou recommended to Beijing that the government drop its support for the Cnooc bid. \"He could smell it was a loser,\" says one Bush administration official. Mr. Zhou declines to comment on the Cnooc spat, other than to say that \"it all became very politicized.\" Lawmakers tell similar stories on Capitol Hill. \"He told us straight out to give it to him with the bark off,\" says Rep. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican who co-chairs a new congressional \"working group\" on China. At a September meeting, Mr. Kirk and other lawmakers told the ambassador that the mood in Congress was turning against China. To deflect anger, they said, Beijing had to take steps such as freeing its currency and cracking down on patent piracy. \"To my pleasure, he was not offended,\" says Mr. Kirk. Still, Mr. Zhou's frustration with official Washington is one reason he hits the road as often as he can to push China's cause. Chinese diplomats contend Congress is out of step with popular opinion. They cite a recent poll commissioned by the Committee of 100, a group representing prominent Chinese Americans. It found only 19% of congressional staffers have a positive view of China, compared with 59% of Americans overall. \"I appeal to you to talk to your congressman and senators,\" Mr. Zhou told an audience at the Des Moines Marriott on a recent day. Among those sipping cocktails during the speech were state senators, soybean farmers, bankers and manufacturers, many with interests in China. On his Iowa trip, Mr. Zhou brought four assistants, two from China's Chicago consulate. All were fluent English speakers and all were under 35. The message wherever Mr. Zhou goes is that trade with China is good for the U.S. and protectionism will only harm both sides. \"What I've learned here augers very well for Iowa and China,\" he told the crowd, citing U.S. farm sales to China. In Cedar Rapids the next day, Mr. Zhou hustled into a boardroom at Hunter's Specialties, a family-owned hunting-supply company that now makes more than a third of its equipment in China. Owner David Forbes launched into a litany of complaints about how hard it is to get components into China from other Asian suppliers. Mr. Zhou interrupted him. \"Let me introduce my commercial counselor in Chicago,\" he said, pointing to a young diplomat, Wang Weijia, in a pinstriped suit. \"He will help you cut the red tape.\" Mr. Wang jumped up to present his business card to Mr. Forbes, who looked overjoyed. \"I'll be calling you,\" Mr. Forbes said. Last month, Mr. Zhou also traveled to upstate New York, where he touted big-ticket purchases by China from local subsidiaries of General Electric Co. in a speech before the U.S.-China Peoples Friendship Association, a nonprofit group. He spent three days in Denver the next week, visiting companies, dropping by a Mandarin class at a local private school, and extolling the value of deeper trade ties at a sold-out speech before the Denver World Affairs Council. Mr. Zhou was still in Beijing last fall as deputy foreign minister when Chinese officials first began to weigh whether to hire a formal lobbying arm in Washington, a move the Chinese government has long resisted. China had paid, reluctantly, for limited legal assistance in the U.S., but spurned calls to spend more on lobbyists. But Mr. Zhou and the Foreign Ministry relented in early summer, as calls for punitive trade legislation against China mounted in Congress. In July, the embassy signed up one of Washington's biggest lobbying outfits, Patton Boggs, to open doors and smooth relations with U.S. lawmakers. Patton Boggs -- which has done similar work for Saudi Arabia and Pakistan -- declines to talk about the contract, which calls for the embassy to pay a $22,000 monthly retainer, according to documents filed with the U.S. Justice Department. Chinese companies, too, are getting into the act. Cnooc, which is largely government-owned, set a new Chinese standard for seeking lobbying help this summer when it hired Washington law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and five other legal, lobbying and public- relations firms to push its cause in Washington. Still, China lags far behind much smaller Asian neighbors in spending on lobbyists. Since 1998, Taiwan -- which has a five-story \"representative office\" in Washington but no formal diplomatic relations with the U.S. -- has spent about $1 million a year on hired representation, according to the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington-based research group. During the same time, China spent about a third as much. The Patton Boggs contract won't push China's annual government spending on legal and lobbying help in the U.S. above $600,000. The embassy has made a point in recent months of seeking free help, too, especially from China scholars stashed among Washington's think tanks. In September, Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick accused China of creating a \"cauldron of anxiety\" and urged Beijing to become a responsible \"stakeholder\" in the world community. The remarks, delivered in a speech in New York, caused near panic among China's U.S. diplomatic corps, according to Chinese diplomats and China scholars. Chinese officials knew the diplomatic meaning of \"rival\" and \"ally\" and even \"competitor.\" \"What is meant by stakeholder here?\" queried a senior Chinese diplomat in an email the next day to one Washington China scholar. \"Is China not one already? And is it of a positive, neutral or negative connotation, or both positive and negative?\" Mr. Zhou has come to embrace the term and heralds it as a sign of improved relations. Asked to describe in a sentence how the Bush administration now sees China he says, \"We are a stakeholder.\"",
        "debiased_text": "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Zhou Wenzhong visited central Iowa as part of his ongoing efforts to engage with Americans outside Washington. During his three-day trip, he met with local officials, business leaders, and residents, emphasizing the benefits of U.S.-China trade relations. His itinerary included a visit to Cedar Rapids, the district represented by Rep. James Leach, who chairs the Asian subcommittee of the House International Relations Committee. Ambassador Zhou stated that building connections in regions outside major cities is important for bilateral relations. Zhou, who has held diplomatic posts in the U.S. before, has set a goal to meet with all 535 members of Congress and visit all 50 states during his tenure. His current trip marks his third state visit in four weeks. The ambassador highlighted trade opportunities, noting Iowa's agricultural exports to China as an example of mutual economic benefits. During discussions with business leaders, Zhou addressed concerns about trade barriers, introducing his commercial counselor to assist with logistical challenges. The visit reflects China's broader diplomatic strategy to strengthen ties with the U.S. amid ongoing trade and political discussions. Recent months have seen tensions over issues including currency valuation, textile exports, and energy deals. China has increased its engagement with U.S. lawmakers and institutions, including hiring lobbying firms to facilitate communication. The embassy has also sought input from policy experts at Washington think tanks. While differences remain on various policy matters, both countries continue diplomatic efforts ahead of planned meetings between their leaders. China's diplomatic outreach extends beyond Washington, with cultural exchanges and economic partnerships promoted across the U.S. The ambassador's activities are part of China's approach to present itself as a cooperative international partner."

        "original_text": "\"If you owe your bank a hundred pounds, you have a problem. But if you owe a million, it has.\" John Maynard Keynes If Keynes was right, the world's creditor countries have a huge problem and the US none at all. Yet the assumption that the creditors should be more terrified than the debtor is wrong if the latter needs to continue borrowing. If creditors face an endless stream of additional borrowing and a good chance of default at the end of it, they should refuse to throw good money after bad. They will then impose huge costs on the debtor. This balance of financial terror, as it has been called, characterises the current huge flows of finance to the US. Carefully thought through economic policy is needed if the world is to extricate itself from this predicament. Alas, we can rely on the administration of George W. Bush not to provide it. So it proved at this weekend's meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. The communique remarked that \"we emphasise that more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major countries and areas that lack such flexibility\". If anyone was in doubt about what that meant, John Snow, the US treasury secretary, insisted that China should embrace a looser exchange rate immediately. Mr Snow is not the organ-grinder of US economic policy but the monkey. But he accurately reflected the \"China-bashing\" now sweeping across US politics, so painfully reminiscent of the Japan- bashing of past decades. As Nouriel Roubini of New York University promptly responded, the US attack on one of its principal creditors is playing with fire. In the past two years, he argues, three quarters of the US fiscal deficit has been financed by foreign central banks, 100 per cent of the fiscal deficit has been financed from abroad and about 80 per cent of the current account deficit has been financed by foreign central banks.* Biting the hand that feeds one is folly. According to the International Monetary Fund, the US general government fiscal deficit this year will be 4.4 per cent of gross domestic product, while the current account deficit is forecast to be 5.8 per cent of GDP. At present, therefore, the American people are able to consume and invest as if the fiscal deficits did not exist. The treasury secretary of what is arguably the most fiscally irresponsible US administration since the second world war should fall down on his knees in thanks rather than indulge in complaints. Prof Roubini is also right to note the economic disruption that would ensue if the flow of official international credit were cut off. The consequences would almost certainly include a dollar collapse, higher domestic prices, a jump in interest rates, a fall in prices of housing, a steep rise in household bankruptcies and, not least, a sharp US recession. The bigger and swifter the adjustment in the external accounts, the more drastic those impacts would be. The landing would be hard. Nevertheless, it is in US long-run interests to avoid an explosive build-up of net external liabilities. However big the crisis if a sudden correction were to occur now, it would be nothing compared with what would happen after another decade of rising net liabilities. Better still, instead of choosing between a sudden correction now and a still more brutal sudden correction later, why not go for a smoother correction that starts now? The requirements for such a correction are clear. There needs to be a reduction of spending, in relation to potential output, in the US and an increase in spending in its creditors. A reduction in the US structural fiscal deficit will be required. Exchange rate movement will be needed as well, to facilitate adjustment. Where then does China fit into this? The answer is suggested by the charts, which show the current and capital accounts of all emerging market economies, of Asian emerging economies and of China itself since 1996, the year before the devastating Asian financial crisis. From these, one can draw four important conclusions. First, in 2004, the emerging market economies ran an aggregate current account surplus of Dollars 336bn (Pounds 175bn), just over half of the counterpart of the US deficit of Dollars 666bn. Asian emerging market economies ran a surplus of Dollars 193bn. Second, these current surpluses emerged after the financial crises. This is particularly visible for Asian emerging countries, which ran a current account deficit of Dollars 40bn in 1996 and a surplus of Dollars 114bn in 1998. Third, the private sector has been trying to push emerging market economies into current account deficit. In 2004, the combination of current account surpluses and net capital inflows forced emerging market economies to accumulate Dollars 519bn in reserves. The corresponding figure for Asian emerging economies was Dollars 344bn. Fourth, China is a significant player. Its current account surplus was 18 per cent of the emerging market total in 2004, its net inward direct investment was 28 per cent and its reserve accumulation was 40 per cent. In short, it will be impossible to achieve a significant adjustment of the US current account deficit without a big adjustment by emerging market economies. These are the world's natural deficit countries. Moreover, given present levels of reserves, running current account deficits at least equal to the inflow of FDI is both perfectly safe and obviously sensible. If the emerging market economies had run such current account deficits last year, the total would have been Dollars 186bn. The difference between the actual surplus and this deficit would have been Dollars 523bn, sufficient to eliminate most of the US deficit. Even China on its own is significant. Last year, the sum of its current account surplus and net inflow of FDI was 7 per cent of GDP. If it had run a current account deficit equal to inward FDI, instead, it would have run a deficit of Dollars 52bn. This would have made a difference of Dollars 111bn. The huge reserve accumulations of emerging market economies are by now senseless. These are not only wasteful investments but also prevent the global adjustment that the private sector rightly wishes to make. Emerging market economies should run current account deficits equal to inward FDI. Hectoring China on the exchange rate alone is folly. But a serious discussion of policies to deliver a better global balance is not. That discussion must begin now. * Global Economics Blog, April 17 2005, www.rgemonitor.com martin.wolf@ft.com",
        "debiased_text": "The article discusses global financial dynamics, focusing on the relationship between creditor and debtor nations, particularly the U.S. and China. It references economist John Maynard Keynes’ observation about debt dynamics, noting that large-scale borrowing can shift financial risks. The U.S., as a major debtor, relies on foreign central banks to finance its fiscal and current account deficits. Data from the International Monetary Fund indicates the U.S. general government fiscal deficit at 4.4% of GDP and the current account deficit at 5.8% of GDP in the cited year. The article notes that a sudden halt in international credit flows could lead to economic disruptions, including a potential dollar collapse, higher interest rates, and a U.S. recession. It suggests smoother financial adjustments through reduced U.S. spending, increased creditor nation spending, and exchange rate adjustments. The role of emerging market economies, particularly China, is highlighted, with data showing their significant current account surpluses and reserve accumulations. The article argues that emerging markets running current account deficits equal to foreign direct investment inflows could help rebalance global finances.

        "original_text": "BEIJING -- China agreed to take steps to crack down on piracy of U.S. products as part of a package of incremental market measures meant to ease mounting anti-China sentiment in the U.S. Congress. Taking a tough tone at the end of a one-day round of trade talks here, U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez called the measures \"only one step\" and said the Bush administration would watch closely in coming months to \"be sure that commitments translate into results.\" Both the Bush administration and the Chinese government are eager to deflect calls in Congress to impose punitive tariffs or other protections against soaring Chinese exports to the U.S. One sign of progress, the U.S. delegation said, would be a decrease in the increasing U.S. trade deficit with China, which topped $160 billion last year. It has been widening briskly this year. Beijing said yesterday that China's exports in June rose a faster-than-expected 30.6% to $65.96 billion from the same month last year, while imports rose a relatively slow 15.1% to $56.28 billion. That gave China a trade surplus of $9.68 billion for June and brought its surplus for the first half of 2005 to $39.65 billion, from a deficit of $6.8 billion in the same period last year. The sharp widening has spurred calls in the U.S. and Europe, China's two biggest trading partners, for Beijing to abandon its longstanding peg of the yuan to the dollar. Critics say the policy keeps the price of Chinese goods overseas unfairly low, although many economists say Chinese exports would remain competitive even with a pricier yuan. Even as the latest numbers could intensify the trade backlash against China in Washington and Brussels, some economists say the figures actually mask indications of slower economic growth ahead for China. Growth in imports of materials and parts used for export processing have slowed, which means factory output growth is likely to follow, said Andy Xie, Morgan Stanley's chief economist for the Asian- Pacific region. Yesterday's talks, part of the annual U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, didn't address the hot-button issue of China's fixed monetary system, nor the proposed $18.5 billion purchase of U.S. oil company Unocal Corp. by a Chinese rival, Cnooc Ltd., which has raised public anxieties in the U.S. Instead, the focus was on stemming China's frequent violations of international patent and trademark rules, a chief trade irritant that costs U.S. companies billions of dollars in lost sales. After the meetings, U.S. officials outlined the new steps that China promised to take, several of which remained vague. The Chinese government agreed to increase the number of criminal prosecutions for intellectual-property violations and to conduct more robust raids against counterfeit goods at trade fairs and against any movie DVDs being sold in China before their official release. China also promised to implement new rules that would allow officials to arrest and prosecute people who are exporting counterfeit goods. Chinese counterfeits of U.S.-branded products, ranging from car parts to adhesives and golf clubs, have eroded sales of their legitimate, U.S.-made versions in many parts of the world. On the agricultural front, the Chinese agreed to allow in the last remaining strain of U.S. genetically modified corn, a type sold by Monsanto Co. and known as NK603. U.S. officials said the move was significant because lack of approval for this variety, one of eight now allowed in, threatened to hold up future sales of U.S. corn. The U.S. negotiators temporarily defused a looming battle over U.S. software sales to China. Under pending regulations meant to give the nascent industry a boost, Chinese government agencies would be allowed to purchase only domestic computer software. The U.S. estimates that the government software market totals more than $8 billion. The Chinese government, according to a U.S. statement, agreed to delay issuing software rules \"as it further considers public comments and makes revisions\" in keeping with World Trade Organization rules. The Bush administration, meanwhile, hopes to nudge Beijing into joining the WTO government-procurement agreement, which would open its software market to outside competition. On other fronts, the Chinese agreed to put forward rules to open their market for the first time to direct door-to-door sales by companies such as Amway Corp. or Mary Kay Inc., the U.S. cosmetics company. China also agreed to publish, by the end of the year, a detailed list of all forms of subsidies it offers to business and agriculture, as is required of other members of the WTO. Meanwhile, the Export-Import Bank of China, a government credit arm, will receive a substantial capital injection to support Chinese companies as they push overseas, according to people familiar with the matter. The recapitalization plan would dovetail with Beijing's efforts to support the increasing number of Chinese companies pursuing business outside China's borders. --- Qiu Haixu and Ellen Zhu contributed to this article.",
        "debiased_text": "BEIJING — China agreed to implement measures to address piracy of U.S. products as part of a series of incremental market adjustments discussed during trade talks. The measures were announced following a one-day meeting of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade. U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez stated that the agreements marked progress but emphasized that their implementation would be monitored in the coming months. Both the U.S. and Chinese governments have sought to address concerns in the U.S. Congress regarding the growing trade deficit with China, which reached $160 billion in 2004 and has continued to increase this year. China reported a June trade surplus of $9.68 billion, with exports rising 30.6% to $65.96 billion and imports increasing 15.1% to $56.28 billion. The first half of 2005 saw a total surplus of $39.65 billion, compared to a deficit of $6.8 billion during the same period in 2004. Discussions did not cover China’s currency policy or the proposed acquisition of Unocal Corp. by Cnooc Ltd. Instead, talks focused on intellectual property enforcement, with China committing to increased criminal prosecutions for violations, stronger enforcement against counterfeit goods, and new rules permitting action against counterfeit exporters. Additionally, China agreed to approve the final strain of U.S. genetically modified corn, NK603, for import. A dispute over pending Chinese regulations restricting government software purchases to domestic products was temporarily deferred, with China agreeing to delay implementation while reviewing the rules under WTO guidelines. Other agreements included drafting rules for direct door-to-door sales by foreign companies and publishing a full list of business and agricultural subsidies by year’s end, as required under WTO commitments. Separately, the Export-Import Bank of China is expected to receive additional funding to support overseas operations by Chinese companies."

        "title": "China is far more than just another Asia Inc: JOHN RIDDING: [USA 2ND EDITION]; China is far more than just another Asia Inc: JOHN RIDDING::   [USA 2ND EDITION ]",
        "original_text": "It has become a rite of passage - and generally a curse - for dynamic Asian economies to attract the label \"Inc\" in books that predict how they will transform the world order. After Japan Inc in the 1980s, shortly followed by Korea and the other regional tigers, economic pundits are now in awe of China's rise and a batch of new books is analysing the impact of \"the next superpower\". Two of these books rightly portray China's economic resurgence as very different from that of earlier Asia Incs. Rejecting tired notions of uniform formulas or \"Asian values\", they recognise the complexities as well as the undoubted scale of the upheaval it is causing. Both books have their breathless moments. But then some of their claims are breathtaking. According to Ted Fishman, almost as many Chinese study English as a second language as there are English- speakers in the US, Canada and the UK combined. Oded Shenkar adds that Wal-Mart imports more goods from China than do Britain or France. Beyond the big numbers, and of greater importance, is how these books assess the nature of China's resurgence and why, to quote Shenkar, it \"has more in common with the rise of the United States a century earlier than with the progress of its modern-day predecessors\". China's relatively open domestic market is a crucial consideration. Whereas Korea and Japan became synonymous with protectionism, multinationals have flocked through China's more open doors. For both authors the implications are substantial. \"China is the only country in the world where domestic automotive makers maintain equity ventures with competing foreign partners which make it possible to learn best practices from both and end up with potentially more knowledge than either,\" writes Shenkar. The lure of the mainland market also helps explain the apparent contradiction between a business environment rife with piracy and Dollars 50bn (Euros 38bn) plus of annual foreign investment. Shenkar charts a compelling course through the impact of China's awesome production base - through international retail markets, prices, consumers and ultimately into social divisions in the west. The coincidence of huge-scale, low-cost production and the consolidation of global retailers, he argues, has accelerated and amplified China's impact. \"They (retailers) have the market presence to sell an untested brand,\" he writes. The flood of consumer goods into global markets and the opposite flow of capital to China creates divisions and tensions at the social and political level. Toyotas were once hacked to pieces in Detroit as part of a \"buy American\" campaign. However, as Shenkar argues, the scale of investment by multinationals in China, the importance of outsourcing for cost-competitiveness and the price benefits for consumers suggest any meaningful \"anti-China\" coalition is now unlikely. Both books demonstrate how the range and depth of interactions between the US and Chinese economies reduce the constraints on China's rise. But if the theses are similar, the styles are rather different. Whereas Shenkar, an academic, builds a more theoretical case, Fishman, a journalist, has a magpie's eye for the interesting fact and a few big ideas. Thus, he suggests that the US will be disadvantaged by its lack of Mandarin speakers, citing a recent count of just 50,000 Chinese language students in American high schools. \"One must ask who will be the better global managers - native speakers of English working in China who rely on their bilingual local managers or Chinese managers who can deal with their workers directly.\" Where both books fall short is in assessing the flaws in the Chinese system. China's rise may well be different from that of Japan and Korea. But it is worth remembering that their \"unstoppable\" marches halted abruptly amid much hubris. In Korea, the Asian financial crisis revealed corrupt allocation of credit. Japan turned out to be sclerotic. Many of China's faultlines are strikingly similar to those that derailed its precursors. Its banks are hobbled by bad loans. And, as with Korea's tumultuous transition to democracy, China's economic rise could carry the seeds of its own destruction through the social divisions and expectations it creates. These are important omissions, even within the books' own terms of reference. For a Chinese crash could pose as big a global challenge as the continued rise they predict. The writer is the editor of the FT's Asia edition",
        "debiased_text": "Several books are examining China's economic growth and its potential global impact. This follows earlier analyses of Japan, Korea, and other Asian economies during their periods of economic expansion. Two recent books compare China's economic development to that of previous Asian economies and the United States a century ago, noting significant differences.\n\nThe books highlight China's relatively open domestic market, contrasting with the protectionist policies historically associated with Japan and Korea. According to the authors, this openness has attracted substantial foreign investment, despite concerns about intellectual property rights. One author notes that China's automotive sector uniquely maintains partnerships with multiple foreign competitors, allowing knowledge transfer.\n\nThe books analyze how China's large-scale, low-cost production affects global retail markets, pricing, and Western economies. One author suggests that the combination of China's manufacturing capacity and global retail consolidation has amplified these effects. While previous protectionist movements targeted Japanese products, the current level of multinational investment in China may reduce similar anti-China movements.\n\nBoth books examine the growing economic interdependence between the U.S. and China, though their analytical approaches differ. One takes an academic perspective while the other incorporates journalistic observations, such as language education statistics.\n\nThe books focus less on potential weaknesses in China's economic system. Previous Asian economic powers experienced unexpected downturns after periods of rapid growth. China faces similar challenges, including banking sector issues with non-performing loans and potential social tensions arising from economic changes. These factors could affect China's continued economic expansion, though the books primarily emphasize growth scenarios."

        "title": "China's secret internet police target critics with web of propaganda",
        "original_text": "China's communist authorities have intensified their campaign against the party's biggest potential enemy - the internet - with the recruitment of a growing army of secret web commentators, sophisticated new monitoring software and a warning that all bloggers and bulletin board operators must register with the government or be closed down and fined. The escalation of the government's effort to neutralise critical online opinion comes after a series of large anti-Japanese, anti-pollution and anti-corruption protests, many of which were organised or publicised using instant messaging services, chatrooms and text messages. With the number of users forecast to rise above 100 million this year, access to the web is spreading beyond China's well-rewarded middle class and into the more disgruntled factory and farming communities, where young migrant workers are teaching their families about internet cafes. In response, the propaganda departments of provincial and municipal governments have recently been instructed to build teams of internet commentators, whose job is to guide discussion on public bulletin boards away from politically sensitive topics by posting opinions anonymously or under false names. Although advertisements are supposed to have been placed in-house, many details about the part-time political pacifiers have emerged in the domestic media. According to the Southern Weekend newspaper, a team of about 20 commentators has been operating in the city of Suqian, in Jiangsu province, since April. \"In the information age and the internet age, the most important and critical mission in front of us is how to seize the initiative on internet opinion and how to seize the high point of internet opinion,\" the paper quoted the deputy director of the local propaganda department, Zhang Fenglin, as saying. Applicants for the job - mostly drawn from the propaganda and police departments - were told they had to understand government policies, know political theory, be politically reliable and understand internet technology. Successful candidates have been offered classes in Marxist theory, propaganda techniques and updates on the development of the internet around the world. A summary of objectives declared that commentators should \"be proactive in developing discussion, increase control, accentuate the good, avoid the bad, and use internet debate to our advantage.\" Reports that at least two other localities have recruited similar teams suggest the strategy is being encouraged by the central government. Few will admit to the practice, but Nanjing officials said the city was hiring 20 online commentators from the ranks of its existing employees. \"They don't need to give up their current jobs because it is not full time. All they need to do is spend some time every day monitoring internet discussion,\" said a member of the propaganda department. \"There are commentators like this all over the country. Until now we haven't had detailed instructions about how it works. So nothing is clear yet.\" Although the existence of an internet police force - estimated at more than 30,000 - has been known for some time, attention has previously focused on their work as censors and monitors. Countless critical comments appear on bulletin boards of major portals such as Sohu and Sina only to be erased minutes, or sometimes just seconds, later. In the most recent case, all postings that blamed corrupt local officials or slow-moving police for the deaths of 88 children in floods last Friday were removed almost as soon as they appeared. But the task of covertly guiding opinion - as in Suqian - has proved controversial for different reasons. \"I think Suqian's practice is not proper,\" said Zhan Jiang, dean of journalism at China Youth University for Political Sciences. \"If officials want to guide public opinion they should publish an editorial in the People's Daily under their own names. It is very wrong to anonymously spread government propaganda. Online commentary is a kind of abuse of power.\" China's leading bloggers were equally scathing. \"The government's tactics are too funny. They are actually hiring staff to curse online,\" said Liu Di, who was arrested last year for comments she posted under her internet moniker Iron Mouse. \"But it also shows that the government can find no better way to deal with netizens' discussion. Compared to other media in China, the internet is still the most free. It is powerful among young people no matter whether they are chatting online or playing games. It will be difficult for the government to control.\"",
        "debiased_text": "Chinese authorities have implemented measures to manage online content, including the recruitment of internet commentators, the use of monitoring software, and a requirement for bloggers and bulletin board operators to register with the government. These actions follow protests organized or publicized through digital platforms. Internet usage in China is expanding, reaching a broader demographic including factory and farming communities. Provincial and municipal propaganda departments have been instructed to form teams of internet commentators to guide discussions away from sensitive topics by posting anonymously. Reports indicate that such teams, like one in Suqian, Jiangsu province, have been active since April. Applicants for these roles are required to understand government policies, political theory, and internet technology. Training includes Marxist theory and propaganda techniques. Similar initiatives have been reported in other regions, suggesting a broader strategy. Existing employees are being hired part-time to monitor online discussions. While an internet police force has been known to censor content, the use of commentators to guide opinion has drawn mixed reactions. Some critics argue that anonymous government propaganda is improper, while others note the challenges authorities face in managing online discourse."

        "original_text": "Freshly returned from his fence-mending trip to Europe, George W. Bush, the US president, will soon face a diplomatic challenge from the other side of the world: long-time rivals China and Japan have both started to assert themselves more forcefully, unsettling the delicate balance of power in east Asia. Before he began his first term of office, Mr Bush and his team portrayed China as a \"strategic competitor\" to the US, but in the past four years relations between Beijing and Washington have warmed and the administration has focused its attention on Afghanistan, Iraq and the war on terror. China never emerged as an important issue in the 2004 election campaign that gave Mr Bush his second term. The US attitude to China, however, now seems to be hardening again. Mr Bush, concerned that European defence technology could help the Chinese armed forces challenge US dominance of the Pacific, spent much of his time and energy last week trying to dissuade the European Union from lifting its arms embargo on Beijing. In Washington, Porter Goss, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, omitted the normal nod to US-China co-operation when he warned that China's military modernisation was changing the balance of power in the Taiwan Strait and increasing the threat to US forces. Other officials have said the same, confirming that Washington is actively reassessing the Chinese challenge to US influence. For China, the most ominous sign was the joint declaration by the US and Japan identifying peace in the Taiwan Strait as a common strategic objective. Beijing attacked what it called Japanese meddling as \"an abominable act\". China reserves the right to invade Taiwan if the island seeks de jure independence, and one of the issues guaranteed to inflame Chinese public opinion is the status of Taiwan; the other is Japan's attitude towards China. Tokyo, Washington's main Asian ally, has managed to combine the two by using Taiwan as a diplomatic cudgel against Beijing. The granting of a Japanese visa to Lee Teng-hui, the independence campaigner and former Taiwanese president, was just one of the steps that infuriated Chinese leaders. It would be an exaggeration to refer to the latest round of name- calling between Japan and China as a crisis. Like the US and China, Japan and China have close and mutually beneficial ties of trade and investment. Taipei and Beijing, after organising direct flights between the island and the mainland over the Chinese New Year holiday, have toned down their hostile rhetoric. And all the big powers in east Asia are trying to achieve the nuclear disarmament of North Korea through the six-party talks. Even so, the combination of resurgent nationalism in Japan and the increasingly muscular foreign policy practised by China is something Mr Bush will have to watch carefully during his second term.",
        "debiased_text": "Following his recent trip to Europe, US President George W. Bush faces diplomatic developments in East Asia involving China and Japan, both of which have taken more assertive stances recently. Before his first term, the Bush administration characterized China as a 'strategic competitor,' but relations improved during his first term as focus shifted to Afghanistan, Iraq, and counterterrorism. China was not a major issue in the 2004 election. Recently, however, the US has shown signs of reassessing its stance on China. During his European trip, Bush raised concerns about potential EU arms sales to China, citing possible impacts on regional military balances. CIA Director Porter Goss noted China's military modernization as influencing the Taiwan Strait balance and affecting US forces. The US and Japan jointly declared peace in the Taiwan Strait a shared strategic objective, which China criticized as interference. China maintains a policy regarding Taiwan's potential formal independence, while Japan, a US ally, has engaged in diplomatic actions concerning Taiwan, including issuing a visa to former Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui. Despite tensions, China and Japan maintain strong trade and investment ties. Cross-strait relations saw temporary eased tensions during Chinese New Year with direct flights. Meanwhile, regional powers, including the US, China, and Japan, continue negotiations on North Korea's denuclearization. The evolving dynamics of Japan's nationalism and China's foreign policy approach present ongoing considerations for the Bush administration."

        "title": "Be more like Taiwan, Bush urges China",
        "original_text": "George Bush has called on China to take the lead from its arch-rival Taiwan and become more democratic in remarks that are likely to sour US-Chinese relations before he visits Beijing at the weekend. The US president also urged the Chinese government to permit more religious freedom and open its economy to US business, warning that domestic demands for political freedom would grow as China became richer. \"What I say to the Chinese, as well as to others, is that a free society is in your interest,\" Mr Bush said. \"Modern Taiwan is free and democratic and prosperous. By embracing freedom at all levels, Taiwan has delivered prosperity to its people and created a free and democratic Chinese society.\" Taiwan and China have a frosty relationship and are still technically in a state of civil war nearly 60 years after China's former Kuomintang government fled the mainland to establish the modern state of Taiwan. Beijing regards Taiwan as an estranged province rather than an independent country, and Taiwanese boasts of independence often prompt military muscle-flexing in Beijing. Last July, the Chinese general Zhu Chenghu alarmed Washington officials when he stated that China could use nuclear weapons if the US were to attack the mainland in a dispute over Taiwan. He stressed, however, that the views were his own rather than Beijing's. Mr Bush's remarks drew a swift response from the Chinese foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing. Refusing to acknowledge Taiwan by name, he suggested that outside intervention would not help the people of the region \"work well together to preserve stability and achieve prosperity\". \"We have to work hard and not pay attention to those people who talk about this or that trying to shake our conviction, especially when it comes to our love of the motherland,\" he said. Before September 11, China's aggressive attitude towards Taiwan was a key issue for the Bush administration, but today's remarks are a departure from Washington's current focus, economic issues. Mr Bush none the less reiterated demands for China to further revalue its currency and allow US business greater access - topics expected to be at the centre of discussions in Beijing this weekend. China's economic rise has come to alarm Americans as the US's trade deficit with Beijing has grown. The figure, marking the amount by which Chinese exports to America outweigh US exports to China, is expected to top $200bn (£116bn) this year - up 25% on last year. Mr Bush warned that economic growth could pose problems for China's entrenched political class. \"As China reforms its economy its leaders are finding that once the door to freedom is opened even a crack, it cannot be closed,\" he said. \"As the people of China grow in prosperity, their demands for political freedom will grow as well.\" Mr Bush made the comments in a joint press conference with Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, in Kyoto, his first stop on a tour of the far east that will take in South Korea, China and Mongolia. He is also expected to anger China during the visit with plans to worship at one of Beijing's five officially sanctioned Protestant churches on Sunday. America's Christian right regards religious freedom in China as a central issue, and the church visit is likely to be interpreted as a criticism of Chinese laws that mandate the registration of religious groups and ban the importation of Bibles. \"To allow people to worship freely, for example, in your society is part of a stable, mature society. And that leadership should not fear freedoms within their society,\" Mr Bush said today.",
        "debiased_text": "George Bush addressed China during remarks that mentioned Taiwan, ahead of his planned visit to Beijing. The U.S. president encouraged China to consider political reforms, citing economic growth and public expectations. He stated, 'A free society is in your interest,' and referenced Taiwan as an example of a democratic and prosperous system. Taiwan and China maintain strained relations, with China considering Taiwan a breakaway province rather than an independent nation. Tensions between the two have included military posturing, such as statements last July from a Chinese general about potential nuclear retaliation in a Taiwan-related conflict, though he clarified these were personal views, not official policy. The Chinese foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, responded by emphasizing regional stability and discouraging external influence. While Taiwan was previously a major U.S. policy focus, economic issues now dominate discussions. Bush reiterated calls for China to adjust its currency valuation and improve U.S. business access—topics expected in upcoming talks. The U.S. trade deficit with China is projected to increase significantly this year. Bush suggested that economic development could lead to political changes in China. He made these remarks in Kyoto alongside Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, during a trip that includes stops in South Korea, China, and Mongolia. During his visit, Bush plans to attend a Protestant church service in Beijing, which may draw attention due to U.S. concerns over religious freedom in China. Chinese regulations require religious group registration and restrict Bible imports."

        "original_text": "Video footage of a deadly clash between farmers and gangs employed by a Chinese electricity company to turf them off their land has been released, providing startling evidence of local conflicts normally kept hidden or denied. The video, acquired by the Washington Post from a local farmer, shows a gang of young men armed with pipes and shovels as they charge a huddle of peasant protesters who have refused to abandon their land to developers. After a short one-sided battle, a single farmer is left on the ground, where he is beaten senseless by an assailant armed with a pole. Soon after the cameraman is attacked. There is an explosion, the sound of gunshots and screams of \"Run!\", then the images suddenly end. According to the Beijing News, six villagers and one attacker were killed in the incident and at least 48 people were injured, eight of them seriously. The fighting, which occurred last Saturday, was reportedly the latest and most violent of several assaults by up to 300 thugs who were hired by a local utilities company to force the peasants off their land. Tensions had been simmering since 2003, when the villagers refused to accept an offer from Hebei Guohua Power, a state-owned company which wanted to build a storage facility on their land, about 140 miles south-west of Beijing. Although local officials approved the sale of the property, the farmers refused to budge. Many have been living in tents on the land ever since, despite increasingly violent attempts to force them to move. In April during one attack in the middle of the night, the villagers captured a hostage, Zhu Xiaorui. The 23-year-old told the Washington Post he had been paid 100 yuan (£7), armed with a metal pole and told to \"teach a lesson\" to the farmers. He was released earlier this week after contrite officials visited the village and offered 50,000 yuan compensation to the families of the bereaved. The climbdown by the authorities appears to have been prompted by the coverage of the clashes in the domestic and international media. According to Outlook, a Communist party-backed magazine about 58,000 protests took place across the country in 2003, a rise of 15% over the previous year. With China in the midst of a spectacular and often unregulated spurt of development, many peasants are thrown off their property, usually with little compensation. Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, appears anxious to avoid a repeat of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown and has adopted a relatively relaxed stance to such protests. Reprisals against the demonstrators have been few, and many punishments have been meted out to officials.",

The altercation occurred last Saturday and is described as one in a series of confrontations involving individuals allegedly hired by a local utilities company to facilitate land clearance. Disputes over the land began in 2003 when Hebei Guohua Power, a state-owned company, proposed constructing a storage facility on the site located approximately 140 miles southwest of Beijing. While local authorities approved the land transfer, farmers declined to vacate and have since resided on the property despite repeated efforts to remove them. In April, during an overnight incident, villagers detained Zhu Xiaorui, a 23-year-old who stated he was paid 100 yuan, provided with a metal pole, and instructed to confront the farmers. Zhu was released after officials visited the village and offered 50,000 yuan in compensation to affected families. Media coverage of the clashes may have influenced this response. Outlook, a magazine with Communist party affiliations, reported approximately 58,000 protests occurred nationwide in 2003, marking a 15% increase from the prior year. As China undergoes significant development, land disputes involving farmers receiving minimal compensation have been reported. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has generally taken a restrained approach to such protests, with limited punitive measures against demonstrators and some actions taken against officials."

        "title": "Alphabet of global downturn",
        "original_text": "The unwelcome arrival of Katrina and Rita in the US has swept away illusions about American society. The competence of the authorities, the standard of living of many of its people, the fabric of the country's infrastructure - all have been cast in doubt by the storms' effects. Third World scenes of starvation, looting and rampage have emphasised the fine line between ordered society and the law of the jungle. No country is ever that many steps away from anarchy and chaos. The same is true of financial markets. Although a natural optimist, I am going to make a prediction that is almost apocalyptic. In a short time - a few years at most - the rich West and Japan will have a terrible shock. Living standards will fall precipitously, companies will fail en masse and established institutions will find themselves in financial peril. Asset prices - particularly those of houses - will fall dramatically in some countries, notably the US and UK, and world trade conditions will deteriorate significantly. Worse, global tensions will rise and China will not only be a threat to Italian sock and bra manufacturers, but a potential military threat to the Pax Americana. There will be no warning of the arrival of this downturn, but the early signs are clear. Simplistically, I distil these threats into five categories, A, B, C, D and E. All of them represent confluent trends that herald the end of a long period of human advancement in the rich world. Six decades of technological advance, growth in material output, extension of human longevity, and unbroken peace in our cosseted part of the world, is coming to a conclusion. The five trends are: · Anti-Americanism and the beginning of the end of US hegemony. · Balances - trade, fiscal and societal - which are out of kilter as never before. · China's growth which has put it on the way to being the world's largest economy and the main Pacific power. · Debts run up by consumers, companies and governments are at all-time peaks, and a dramatic and painful correction is the only remedy. · Environmental: even ardent Bushites must be beginning to think man is having some effect on the planet's climate. The world's population has quadrupled in 60 years, and the problems of waste and consumption, as well as of pollution, are not going to get any better. The anti-Americanism is a feature of nightly TV news bulletins. Since two-thirds of the world's population - the part that is young and growing - live in relative poverty, there will be frustration about and antipathy towards the Big Brother of the affluent world. The US policy of acting as a roving cop has added to Second and Third World disaffection, and fundamentalism and terrorism are the children of disaffection. Efforts to help the poor world with rock concerts and debt cancellations are noble but insufficient, especially as Western farm subsidies do more harm to developing countries than our aid does good. This anti-Americanism, and the US forays into hot spots around the globe, are in themselves not major factors in my economic predictions. But they add a backdrop of malaise to an already deteriorating situation, and will complicate any recovery from what is going to be a period of decline. Balances - the B on my list - are glaringly awful. The US imports half as much again as it exports, and it pays for the deficiency in its own, self-printed currency. Trade's obese twin deficit - the fiscal one - is largely paid for by Asian central banks recycling surplus dollars they receive for selling goods to America, through the acquisition of US government debt. These negative balances - which apply to the UK as well - have been around for a long time, but we are close to the limits of their expansion. Any refusal by the Asians to keep on funding US profligacy, or any serious moves to protectionism by the major Western nations, will tip us into a rerun of the 1929 Wall Street crash. There is only one way out for the US, and it involves pain. I forecast that a deflationary period of adjustment is imminent and that while, confusingly, we are in a short period of commodity-induced price inflation, ultimately asset prices will fall. The Anglo-Saxon housing bubbles are close to popping, and that will drag down consumption - the great driver of the world's economy - by more than anyone now imagines. And that brings me to China. Its growth and ambitions are well known. Nearly a quarter of the world's population are prepared to work for wages which are on average one-hundredth of those in Germany. Whatever Germany, or the US or Italy, try to do, they cannot compete with that. More and more production will go to China, protectionist pressures will intensify and diplomatic tensions will grow with them. All sorts of potential flashpoints exist, but if I had to pick one it would be Taiwan. China wants Taiwan back and one day it will have a go at getting it. The US response to that should be of more than casual interest to us. In a way, we are in 1912 again. British supremacy was waning then and a new military power rising, one based on economic achievement. Then, of course, it was Germany. We have to hope a similar conflict doesn't result with China. The first problem with debt is that US and UK consumers have been using rising house prices as a kind of ATM machine to take out equity to spend, often on imported goods. When the merry-go-round stops - as is beginning to happen - the consumption stops too. A slump in consumption lasting a decade or more, as happened in Japan, is possible for both nations. American debt is higher today relative to the size of the US economy than it was in 1929, and all the monetary and fiscal tinkering in the world can't cure its pernicious effects. Last there are environmental issues. Wind farms, solar power and carbon credits will be nowhere near enough to combat the effects of population growth, China's higher consumption of commodities and the obliteration of the rainforests. Less consumption and more nuclear power are the only solutions. In short, within three years the world economy will be in a significant downturn, and the correction process for the Anglo-Saxon economies will last as long as a decade. Pay, and therefore living standards, will have to adjust to the effect of Chinese competition. Stock markets will collapse, house prices in the over-extended markets of the UK and the US will fall by up to 50 per cent, and major investment banks and other financial institutions will go bust. Opportunities will abound for those with cash and little or no debt, but remember that the people who threw themselves from Wall Street windows in 1929 were generally not those who got caught up in the early part of the Crash. They were those who bought when shares had halved. Cheap can and will get cheaper. · 'Wake Up!

The storms resulted in widespread disruptions, including shortages and civil unrest in some areas. Financial markets, while historically resilient, face several challenges that could impact global economic stability. Current economic indicators suggest potential vulnerabilities in trade balances, debt levels, and environmental pressures. The US currently runs a trade deficit and fiscal imbalance, partly financed by foreign holdings of US government debt. China's economic growth continues, now representing a substantial portion of global manufacturing output. Global debt levels, including consumer, corporate, and government debt, remain high across major economies. Environmental concerns persist regarding resource consumption and climate change impacts. Various analysts project different scenarios for future economic conditions, with some anticipating potential adjustments in asset values and consumption patterns. Geopolitical tensions, including those surrounding Taiwan, remain subjects of international discussion. These factors contribute to ongoing debates about long-term economic trends and stability."

        "original_text": "China and Taiwan today inched towards reconciliation when the Taiwanese president invited his Chinese counterpart to visit the country and Beijing offered a gift of two pandas. The gestures marked the close of the highest level contact between the two nations since 1949 as the Taiwanese opposition leader, Lien Chan, returned from an eight-day trip to the mainland. The Taiwanese - the Chinese nationalists - were on the losing side in China's civil war, and fled to the island after the communist takeover of the mainland. Beijing considers Taiwan to be part of its territory, and has threatened to invade if it declares independence. While the Taiwanese president, Chen Shui-bian, said he would welcome the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, to the island, he continued to stress his pro-independence stance. \"I hope [Hu] can come to see for himself whether Taiwan is a sovereign, independent country, and what our 23 million people have in mind,\" Mr Chen said. Mr Lien said his visit had finished \"very happily, smoothly and successfully\", and Beijing's parting gestures - there were concessions on fruit imports and tourism as well as the pandas - gave him the chance to deflect criticism from those who had accused him of selling out Taiwan's interests. The opposition favours unification with China, and Mr Lien's visit could also have boosted him domestically by weakening support for independence. A Taiwanese declaration of independence would threaten the stability of East Asia region and the wider Pacific area. The Chinese parliament passed an anti-secession law legalising military action should Taiwan move to formal independence, while the US - Taiwan's strongest ally - has pledged to defend it. Mr Lien began his trip in Nanjing, which was the capital when the nationalists ruled China, and also visited Beijing, Xi'an and Shanghai. \"Wherever we went, we were welcomed by citizens who came voluntarily to show their friendship,\" he said on his return. \"This is the most precious experience for us to remember for every member of the delegation.\" China's decision to give two pandas to \"compatriots of Taiwan\" was announced by Chen Yunlin, the director of the Communist party's Taiwan Work Office. The offer had been widely expected in Taiwan - late last week, officials were already discussing what to name the animals. Years ago, a similar gesture by Beijing was refused because Taipei feared it was part of a plot to foster unification. One of the ruling Democratic Progressive party's greatest concerns is that China would insist that Taiwan accepted the pandas as a local Chinese government rather than as a self-governing entity. \"If we accept the pandas, that means we're admitting ourselves we're a local government,\" Hsu Kuo-yung, a ruling party MP said. \"Our lovely next generation is more important than these two lovely animals.\" Mr Chen said the only thing that mattered was that Taiwan would have to respect international treaties on protected wildlife.",

President Chen Shui-bian reiterated his position on Taiwan's independence during the invitation. Lien Chan visited several cities in mainland China, including Nanjing, Beijing, Xi'an, and Shanghai, and reported positive receptions. Chen Yunlin, director of the Communist Party's Taiwan Work Office, announced the decision to send pandas to Taiwan. Previous panda offers were declined by Taipei due to concerns over symbolism regarding Taiwan's status. A member of Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party expressed reservations about accepting the pandas, citing concerns over implications for Taiwan's self-governance.

        "title": "Nigel Cameron and Robin Lovell-Badge: The challenge of the biotech century",
        "original_text": "This appalling practice must cease, say people from left and right, religious and secular The extraordinary news that Korean scientists have used cloning to produce stem cell lines, and that in the UK we have our own first cloned embryos, should focus our minds afresh on what may prove to be the biggest issue of the 21st century. In Britain, parliamentarians and judges have been drawn into the fray; bioethics played a big role in the US presidential election too, and even the UN has been forced to consider the ethics of biotechnology. The crux of the issue is that whereas so-called \"adult\" stem cells are abundant, and are already being used to cure dozens of diseases, embryo stem cells can only be had by killing the embryo. Inevitably, this raises ethical questions - all the more because, while scientists have hyped their promise, the more honest among them admit that its fulfilment is far down the road. The debate is not black and white. Even among those who believe we should use embryonic stem cells for research, there is an argument over whether we should get them from \"spare\" embryos from in-vitro fertilisation, or go further and create in-vitro embryos specifically for this purpose. Or should we go so far as to clone embryos for research - \"therapeutic cloning\"? But while these arguments are live all over the world, one person's mind appears to be made up. Tony Blair wants the Brave New World of embryo research and cloning to begin in Britain. And, as the election has demonstrated, not one of the major parties has so far had the courage to try to stop him. All the options - using \"spares\", and creating and cloning embryos for research - are legal in the UK. Last autumn, I was in London for a conference on cloning. It brought together people as diverse as Brigitte Boisselier of the Raelian flying-saucer-cult, which claims to have cloned babies, and Mary Warnock, godmother of British biotech policy. The audience thought Mme Boisselier eloquent but loopy, little guessing that her argument for baby cloning would soon be echoed by the Commons science and technology committee. The rot started in the 1980s, when Warnock's committee of inquiry came down by a whisker (9-7) in favour of making embryos for research. That narrow vote was one of many lost opportunities. The decision sparked a nationwide debate which convulsed the parliamentary process, and a bill sponsored by Enoch Powell was set to win a big majority to ban all research on embryos - until it was derailed by procedural moves. Margaret Thatcher finally forced through her own law by offering a free vote on its central clause, and set up the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to regulate the world's first jurisdiction to sanction the creation of human life for the sole purpose of its experimental destruction. This practice is outlawed by the world's first bioethics treaty, the European convention on human rights and biomedicine (the Oviedo convention in 1997). Unsurprisingly, the UK has refused to sign. There is a case for permitting some research on embryo stem cells, and the US has led the way by funding work on existing cell-lines but not encouraging the destruction of fresh embryos. This compromise policy has been copied by Germany, and has come close to being adopted by the European commission. But in a spirit of bipartisan, insouciant, moral blindness, Blair has taken Thatcher's policy to new heights by pressing cloning as a means of mass-manufacturing embryos to generate the stem cells. This appalling practice must cease, as conscientious people from left and right, the religious and secular, east and west, have made plain. The UK is out on a moral limb. It is the only major western nation to take this position. The cloning news from Newcastle comes from experiments licensed by the HFEA; the UK is the only major western nation that would formally sanction anything of the kind. If Professor Alison Murdoch had done her experiments in Canada, she could face five years' imprisonment; if in France, seven years. Such experiments are illegal in Australia, too, and in liberal Norway, and Switzerland, centre of the European drug industry. While there are other states with pro-cloning policies (notably China and Singapore), among western democracies the UK is all but alone. The Germans, who know a thing or two about unethical science, banned all human cloning back in 1990. Cloning for experiments is opposed not only by those who oppose abortion, but also by leading environmentalists and feminists. In the UK, a letter to the HFEA protesting against the issuing of cloning licences was signed by feminist sociologist Professor Hilary Rose and environmental leader Dr David King. In the US, pro-choice feminist leader Judy Norsigian has campaigned against it, as has the doyen of environmentalists, Jeremy Rifkin. Though little reported in the British press, just weeks ago the international community finalised what could prove to be one of the most significant developments of the 21st century: the UN declaration on human cloning. The UK's representative was reduced to sputtering anger by a three-year process in which the British position was comprehensively outmanoeuvred by an emerging coalition that included the US, Australia, much of the developing world, Saudi Arabia and Russia. The final vote was almost three to one against cloning, despite abstentions by many Islamic states sympathetic to a ban. Germany, to its everlasting credit, confirmed its position as the global centre of conscience on biotechnology. It not only voted for the declaration, but also its representative repeatedly urged other nations to join him. This is not a debate about the freedom of science, or about abortion, and we certainly cannot allow it to become a debate about boosting the profits of the biotech industry. The importance of a clear moral framework to guide policy as we fast-forward into the momentous challenges of the biotech century is incalculable. Cloning has emerged as the flashpoint ethical question of our generation, a unifying force that draws together men and women of principle from across the cultural and political spectrum. We shall need to make a choice. Will Britain lead the way into the Brave New World, or shall we let the German conscience be our guide? · Nigel Cameron is president of the Institute on Biotechnology and the Human Future at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, and also chairs the Centre for Bioethics and Public Policy in London. He has served as bioethics adviser on the US delegation to the UN cloning discussion, but writes in a personal capacity NigelCameron@aol.com All that is being done is taking a biopsy sample and turning it into useful cells Potential is a word used by people on all sides in debates about stem cells. They will refer to the developmental potential of a stem cell, its ability to give rise to one or more specialised cell types. Or to altered potential or reprogramming, when a stem cell seems to break the rules and develops into a different type of tissue. Some will talk about the potential of stem cells to aid research or - as they have, following events this week - of potential to cure disease. Or they will refer to the potential of an early embryo to develop into a child. And whoever is speaking can put a positive or a negative spin on the word. So when a scientist says that something has the potential to offer a cure, they mean that they don't know of anything that would rule out this possibility. But potential is always conditional. It depends on research to prove something can work and that it is safe. This may take a long time, so caution needs to temper our optimism. But if we are not allowed to do research on embryonic stem (ES) cells then we will not be able to use them for cures. Any potential will be wasted. Scientists derive ES cells, as their name suggests, from very early stage embryos. But this is not the only source of stem cells: adult cells in your body also hold them, because they are needed for maintenance and running repairs. These adult stem cells might have the same potential as ES cells, and are less controversial. Some critics of embryo research say research should be restricted to adult stem cells - in effect banning the embryo work in Newcastle and South Korea reported this week. But the debate should not be about adult versus embryonic cells, but which is likely to be the best to treat any specific disease. By their nature, stem cells derived from very early embryos have the remarkable ability to give rise to any cell type in the adult body - they are pluripotent - which is why we are very excited about their potential for regenerative medicine. They can be grown in large amounts, and we are learning to control how they differentiate, enabling us to obtain specific cell types that might be useful for research or therapies. Indeed, this is already happening: quite remarkable progress in just seven years. Hans Keirstead and colleagues at the University of California at Irvine have used human ES cells to obtain pure populations of oligodendrocytes which wrap around nerve cells, and have restored motor function to rats with spinal cord injuries. Progress has also been made using adult stem cells. Geoff Raisman and colleagues in London have achieved similar results using adult stem cells isolated from the nose. We do not know which method is best. Perhaps both together would be ideal. My point is that we should not stop looking for other potential cures, whether they rely on ES cells or not. It would certainly be silly to put all our eggs in one basket and restrict research to adult stem cells. After all, we are safer in our cars having air bags as well as seat belts. The sensitive issue about ES cell research is their origin: whether it is ethically acceptable to destroy an early embryo to derive them. Early embryos used in research come from two sources. Some are left over from IVF, and would otherwise have been discarded. The rest are prepared using the same technique used to ultimately produce Dolly the sheep - somatic cell nuclear transfer, in which the nucleus from the cell being cloned is squeezed into an empty egg and then encouraged to begin dividing. (Unlike Dolly, human embryos created in this way must be destroyed after a few days and would never be implanted.) The latter technique is commonly called therapeutic cloning. Its potential is that it allows embryos to be created with a genetic signature identical to the cell they were cloned from. Take that cell from a diabetes patient, for instance, and the resulting embryo will have their DNA. Take stem cells from that embryo, grow them into pancreatic tissue for transplant, and the chance of organ rejection is removed. In creating stem cells perfectly matched to their patients, the South Korean team is now half way to this goal. It is important to note that early cloned embryos have no potential to develop into a child unless placed into a receptive womb. It is impossible for this to happen by chance! Essentially, all that is being done is taking a biopsy sample and turning it into useful cells ideal for treating the patient. The cells can also be a very useful tool for research, for example to study genetic diseases or drug treatments, experimenting on cells in a culture dish rather than on people. In the UK, we are fortunate to have a regulatory system on embryo research that is reasonably permissive, allowing derivation of new ES cells from embryos left over from IVF or made by therapeutic cloning. The same is true of a number of other countries, such as Israel, Japan and South Korea. It is often thought that the UK is liberal; however, the system of regulation here is really quite restrictive. No one can do anything without a licence. This is unlike the USA, where it is possible for anyone to attempt anything if they have the money required from non-federal sources. However, the USA is inconsistent, as researchers who rely on federal funds can only work with a few of the first ES cell lines that were made, even though these will be of limited use. The latter is also true of Germany, although there the rules apply irrespective of the funding source. However, Germany is one of several countries where embryo research is banned, even though they are quite happy to adopt methods of assisted conception which rely on research done elsewhere. I think this is morally indefensible. The situation in other European countries ranges from the very permissive, Sweden and Belgium, through Spain, which is more liberal than France, to Italy, which is very restrictive. But there is a lot of pressure for the situation to change in all these \"restrictive\" countries as people realise the potential benefits of the research and fear being left behind. Current research is all about understanding how the potential of stem cells can be harnessed in useful and safe ways, whether they are embryonic or adult stem cells. We need to be, and should be, optimistic that this will lead to cures, but don't misinterpret this as hype; there is clearly much work to be done. · Robin Lovell-Badge is an embryologist, geneticist and stem-cell researcher at the MRC National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London rlovell@nimr.mrc.ac.uk",
        "debiased_text": "Korean scientists have reported using cloning techniques to produce stem cell lines, while the UK has documented its first cloned embryos. These developments have reignited discussions on biotechnology ethics, a topic that has engaged policymakers, bioethicists, and international bodies including the UN. The debate centers on the use of embryonic stem cells, which requires the destruction of embryos, unlike adult stem cells that are already utilized in treating various diseases. The scientific community acknowledges that while embryonic stem cells hold promise, significant research remains before clinical applications are realized. Disagreements persist on whether to use surplus IVF embryos or create embryos specifically for research, including through therapeutic cloning. The UK permits all these approaches under regulation by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Other nations have varying policies: Canada, France, Australia, Norway, and Switzerland prohibit such experiments, while China and Singapore allow them. Germany banned human cloning in 1990. The UN recently adopted a declaration opposed to human cloning, supported by a coalition including the US, Australia, and others, but not the UK. Scientific research continues on both embryonic and adult stem cells. Embryonic stem cells, being pluripotent, can develop into any cell type and offer potential for regenerative medicine, though their use raises ethical questions about embryo destruction. Adult stem cells present fewer ethical concerns but may have more limited applications. The UK's regulatory system permits embryonic stem cell research under license, contrasting with more restrictive policies in some countries and less regulated approaches in others. Researchers emphasize the need for continued study to determine the most effective treatments for specific conditions."

This follows reports that China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) is considering a $13 billion acquisition of US-based Unocal, while India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp is in discussions with Russia regarding potential purchases of Yukos assets. Leo Drollas, deputy chief executive at the Centre for Global Energy Studies, noted the increasing role of these companies in the oil industry. The recent Iran deal follows a previous $70 billion agreement between China's Sinopec and Iran for LNG supplies and a stake in the Yadavaran oilfield. These developments may draw attention from policymakers in Western nations."

        "title": "Bush Chides China on Democracy; In Speech, President Urges Beijing to Provide Freedom, Follow the Model of Taiwan; Bush Chides China on Democracy; In Speech, President Urges Beijing to Provide Freedom, Follow the Model of Taiwan",
        "original_text": "KYOTO, Japan -- President Bush took a restrained swipe at China in remarks prepared for delivery today, praising Beijing for making incremental attempts to liberalize its government and economy, but urging it to get more in step with democratic governments in the region. Mr. Bush called on China to emulate Taiwan by reforming its economic policies and providing basic freedoms for its people. \"As China reforms its economy, its leaders are finding that once the door to freedom is opened even a crack, it cannot be closed,\" according to the advance text of the speech, which was billed as the signal communique of his Asian trip. \"As the people of China grow in prosperity, their demands for political freedom will grow as well.\" In a speech designed to illustrate the delicate balance he seeks to strike between China's economic importance as a trading partner and its human-rights record, Mr. Bush raised a number of sensitive issues. He praised Beijing for taking an active role in efforts to dismantle North Korea's nuclear arsenal and for raising domestic living standards. But he also urged China to allow its citizens \"more freedom to express themselves . . . to print Bibles and other sacred texts without fear of punishment.\" Such freedoms would eventually become demands, Mr. Bush said, as China's citizens grew more affluent. Though he gently chastised Beijing for not having \"yet completed the journey\" of creating a full-blown democracy, Mr. Bush was careful not to get ahead of U.S. policy on Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province. In 2001, Mr. Bush antagonized Beijing when he said Washington would do \"whatever it takes\" to defend Taiwan from an attack by mainland China. The White House had said Mr. Bush's remarks weren't intended to depart from long-established U.S. policy, but many observers disagreed, saying previous administrations had always been deliberately vague about whether Washington would rise to Taiwan's defense in response to an attack from the mainland. In the speech, Mr. Bush reverted to the vague wording of Washington's Taiwan policy, which makes no threat of intervention and urges the two governments to hammer out a \"peaceful resolution of their differences.\" Mr. Bush's Kyoto speech -- which contrasted with administration officials' predictions that the Asian tour would yield more diplomatic pleasantries than policy negotiations -- will likely be carefully parsed in the region as other nations attempt to determine how the president's \"democracy agenda\" squares with Washington's policy toward China. At his second inauguration in January, Mr. Bush signaled an end to the realpolitik of past administrations and declared that adherence to basic democratic principles would define Washington's relationship with other countries. For a variety of reasons, the U.S. has historically maintained relations with dictatorships, especially during the Cold War, when Washington sought to restrain the Soviet Union at practically any cost. Mr. Bush's agenda calls for elevating the spread of democracy over other considerations. Mr. Bush reserved his toughest rhetoric for North Korea and Burma, two isolated Asian dictatorships. \"Even in these lonely places the desire for freedom lives -- and one day freedom will reach their shores as well,\" Mr. Bush said. Administration critics have often said that Mr. Bush's democracy rhetoric would inevitably beach itself when serious strategic and economic relations came into play. China and Saudi Arabia pay little attention to democratic principles, for example, while Pakistan's leader took office after a coup. Relations with the three countries have scarcely changed since Mr. Bush outlined his democracy agenda. Mr. Bush also urged Beijing to \"provide a level playing field\" for American imports, fully float its currency and implement polices to ban the piracy of American intellectual property.",
        "debiased_text": "KYOTO, Japan -- President Bush delivered remarks today in which he addressed China's efforts to liberalize its government and economy, while encouraging further alignment with democratic governments in the region. In his speech, he suggested that China could follow Taiwan's example in economic reform and expanding freedoms for its citizens. According to the prepared text, the President stated, 'As China reforms its economy, its leaders are finding that once the door to freedom is opened even a crack, it cannot be closed. As the people of China grow in prosperity, their demands for political freedom will grow as well.' The speech was positioned as a key statement during his Asian trip. Mr. Bush acknowledged Beijing's role in addressing North Korea's nuclear program and improving domestic living standards, while also urging greater freedoms for Chinese citizens, such as the ability to express themselves openly and print religious texts without restrictions. He noted that such freedoms could become more widely demanded as China's economy develops. On the topic of Taiwan, Mr. Bush refrained from making explicit commitments, reiterating the U.S. position favoring peaceful resolution between China and Taiwan. This contrasted with his 2001 statement, which had been interpreted as a stronger pledge to defend Taiwan. The speech in Kyoto focused on democratic principles as a guiding factor in U.S. foreign policy. Mr. Bush reaffirmed his administration's emphasis on promoting democracy, a theme he highlighted during his second inauguration. The policy has drawn questions regarding its consistency in cases involving strategic and economic partnerships with non-democratic governments. In his remarks, President Bush also called on China to ensure fair trade conditions for U.S. imports, adopt a fully floating currency, and enforce policies against intellectual property theft."

        "title": "Washington trades barbs with Beijing over military US-CHINA RELATIONS: [LONDON 1ST EDITION]; Washington trades barbs with Beijing over military US-CHINA RELATIONS::   [LONDON 1ST EDITION ]",
        "original_text": "The US sharply increased its criticism of China at the weekend, questioning the motives behind a Chinese military build-up, calling on the country's Communist rulers to embrace \"a more open and representative government\" and urging Beijing to do more to persuade North Korea to abandon nuclear weapons. Donald Rumsfeld, US defence secretary, said the Pentagon's 2005 report on the Chinese military, to be published soon, concludes that China's defence spending is much higher than officially admitted, with its military budget ranking highest in Asia and third in the world. Speaking at the annual Asian security conference of the London- based International Institute for Strategic Studies, Mr Rumsfeld criticised China's \"significant roll-out\" of ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan. He said China, although threatened by no other nation, also appeared to be expanding its long-range missile forces, \"allowing them to reach targets in many areas of the world, not just the Pacific region\". \"Though China's economic growth has kept pace with its military spending, it is to be noted that a growth in political freedom has not yet followed suit,\" Mr Rumsfeld said, after lauding the spread of democracy to Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan and Lebanon. In Singapore yesterday, a senior US defence official said the US expected to decide within weeks whether to bring the issue of North Korea's nuclear weapons plans before the United Nations Security Council. North Korea has refused for nearly a year to attend the six- nation talks designed to resolve the problem, and the US has become increasingly frustrated with the failure of China or South Korea to bring pressure to bear on Pyongyang. Japan, the main US ally in the region, also appears to be taking a harder line on North Korea. \"The opinion (in Japan) is gaining ground that we should do something like economic sanctions or bring this matter on the table at the UN,\" Yoshinori Ohno, Japanese minister of state for defence, told the conference. China responded immediately to Mr Rumsfeld's comments on the Chinese armed forces. Cui Tiankai, a senior foreign ministry official, bluntly asked Mr Rumsfeld whether he truly believed China faced no threats and whether the US felt threatened by China's emergence. Mr Rumsfeld repeated his view that China was not under threat, and insisted that the US did not feel threatened by the rise of China. But he added that the Chinese \"will have to find ways to open up their political system\" in a manner compatible with the open economic system needed for further growth. Political and security analysts interpreted Mr Rumsfeld's words as a warning to China not to provoke a conflict in the Taiwan Strait and to put more pressure on North Korea to return to negotiations. But some Asian commentators criticised what they saw as a simplistic American recipe for democratisation and said there were suspicions in Asia that the US wanted to destabilise China. \"My feeling is that the Chinese are alarmed,\" said Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore and a former ambassador to the UN. \"For them the nightmare scenario is for the US to start believing that this tide of democracy should reach China.\"",
        "debiased_text": "The US raised its concerns regarding China over the weekend, addressing Chinese military expansion, governance, and its role in North Korea's nuclear disarmament. US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld stated that an upcoming Pentagon report on China's military would reveal defense expenditures significantly higher than officially reported, placing China's military budget as the largest in Asia and third globally. Speaking at the International Institute for Strategic Studies conference in Singapore, Rumsfeld noted China's deployment of ballistic missiles directed at Taiwan and its expansion of long-range missile capabilities, which could target regions beyond the Pacific. He contrasted China's economic and military growth with the progression of political freedoms, mentioning democratic developments in Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, and Lebanon. Separately, a senior US defense official indicated that a decision on presenting North Korea's nuclear program to the UN Security Council could occur in the coming weeks. North Korea has not participated in six-nation disarmament talks for nearly a year, leading to US concerns over insufficient pressure from China and South Korea. Japan's Defense Minister Yoshinori Ohno suggested growing support in Japan for measures such as economic sanctions or UN involvement regarding North Korea. China's foreign ministry official Cui Tiankai countered Rumsfeld's remarks by questioning whether the US genuinely viewed China as unthreatened or if it felt threatened by China's rise. Rumsfeld reiterated that China faces no external threats and that the US does not perceive China as a threat but emphasized the need for China to adapt its political system to sustain economic growth. Analysts viewed Rumsfeld's statements as a signal for China to avoid escalating tensions over Taiwan and to encourage North Korea to rejoin negotiations. Some Asian commentators perceived the US stance as an oversimplified approach to democratization, with concerns that the US might seek to destabilize China. Kishore Mahbubani of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy suggested that China may be wary of US intentions to promote democratic changes."

        "title": "If Yuan Moves, Will U.S. Rates Go Up?; G-7 Meeting to Confront a Chinese Revaluation and Possible Fallout From Beijing to Peoria; If Yuan Moves, Will U.S. Rates Go Up?; G-7 Meeting to Confront a Chinese Revaluation and Possible Fallout From Beijing to Peoria",
        "original_text": "FINANCE MINISTERS from the Group of Seven industrialized nations will converge today on the clubby Lancaster House in London, where they will raise a question that, depending on whom you believe, could affect pocketbooks from Beijing to Peoria: Should China allow the value of its currency, the yuan, to rise against the dollar. In U.S. bond markets, the question has long fueled anxiety, because many investors believe that China's policy of maintaining a fixed yuan-dollar exchange rate has helped keep U.S. interest rates unnaturally low. The fear: A stronger yuan would curb investment from Asia, causing bond prices here to fall and pushing up the interest rates that U.S. consumers pay for loans on everything from cars to homes. \"We care an awful lot about this,\" said Jason Evans, co-head of Treasury trading at Deutsche Bank in New York. Still, it isn't clear that a Chinese revaluation, on its own, need have much impact on U.S. interest rates. In fact, there's good reason to believe that, if and when China makes a move, the market's concerns will prove unfounded. \"I think a lot of people in the market, because it's been so stable for so long, are looking for anything that might cause the next breakout,\" said Steve Rodosky, a senior vice president at Pimco, a big manager of bond funds based in Newport Beach, Calif. \"You might see a flurry of activity in anticipation of it, but for the real end users, I don't see it as such a big event.\" At the G-7 meeting, which runs today and tomorrow, the finance ministers will, among other things, look for ways to fix what many see as a global imbalance. China and other Asian nations, in an effort to maintain export-led growth in their own economies, have been buying vast numbers of dollars and investing them in U.S. assets such as Treasury bonds. Asia's export policy has made Chinese stereos and toasters cheap in dollar terms, but, in the eyes of some G-7 officials, it also has exacerbated the tendency of U.S. consumers and the government to spend beyond their means. That's why on Saturday, G-7 ministers will have lunch with Chinese finance minister Jin Renqing and People's Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan, most likely to encourage a revaluation of the Chinese currency against the dollar. The meeting probably won't result in any action, but that hasn't stopped wary bond traders in New York from parsing rumors about a Chinese \"float.\" The most recent data on money flowing into U.S. bonds make it easy to see why they're concerned. From January through November 2004, the central banks of Japan and China bought about 30% of all the new Treasury securities the U.S. issued to finance its budget deficit, which reached $412 billion in fiscal 2004. Japan was initially the largest buyer, but more recently China has taken the lead among Asian countries, increasing its holdings by $18.5 billion from September through November. If China decides to revalue its currency, the logic goes, it won't need to buy as many dollars, and won't need to invest those dollars in Treasury bonds. In the absence of Chinese demand, the price of Treasurys likely would fall, and their yields, which move in the opposite direction of price, would rise. Treasury yields matter because they represent the \"risk-free\" rate that finance types use to calculate everything from stock prices to mortgage rates. When Treasury yields rise, consumers and companies alike end up paying more to borrow money, be it for a car, a home or a new piece of equipment. In reality, the mechanism connecting Chinese monetary policy to Treasury prices is far more tenuous than the market logic suggests. One weak link is the assumption that Chinese demand for dollars would fall significantly. In the most likely scenario, China would allow its currency to float within a predetermined \"corridor.\" If and when the currency's value reached the top of the corridor, the Chinese central bank again would buy dollars and invest those dollars in U.S. assets. Any larger rise in the value of the yuan against the dollar would have an adverse effect on the competitiveness of Chinese exports in the U.S. -- something the Chinese government isn't likely to let happen. \"Until China becomes a self-sufficient economy and not totally dependent on exports for growth, and as long as they want to subsidize exporters by managing their currency, they will be forced to buy dollars,\" said Gerald Lucas, chief treasury and agency strategist at Banc of America Securities. Treasurys At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 6/32 point, or $1.8750 per $1,000 face value, at 100 21/32. Its yield rose to 4.167% from 4.145% late Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond's price was down 1/32 at 111 31/32 to yield 4.583% from 4.581%. Corporate Bonds The combined Sears Roebuck and Co. and Kmart Holding Corp. will have a junk rating when the acquisition of Kmart by Sears is completed. Standard & Poor's said the combined retailer, Sears Holdings Corp., will earn a double-B-plus corporate credit rating -- its highest speculative-grade rating. \"We are disappointed in these ratings actions. However, they are very much expected,\" said a Sears spokesman. --- Simona Covel, Aparajita Saha-Bubna and Shayna Stoyko contributed to this article.",

        "original_text": "Increasing involvement by China and other nations in international oil deals could keep prices high for the foreseeable future, and require more involvement by the U.S. and other governments to secure energy supplies, a panel of energy experts told the Senate Energy Committee. Jeffrey Logan, an analyst for the International Energy Agency, said China's rapidly expanding demands for oil are being driven, in part, by plans to fill its version of the U.S.'s Strategic Petroleum Reserve and by its need to burn oil to generate electricity. China's demands for oil jumped 15% last year, while its domestic supplies grew \"very slowly,\" he said. As a result, China moved ahead of Japan to become the world's second-largest oil importer, behind the U.S. Mr. Logan added that China's state-owned oil companies are expanding their reach, contracting for future supplies in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ecuador, Australia and Saudi Arabia. (Prices of natural- gas and crude-oil futures contracts fell yesterday.) Mr. Logan warned that China's secrecy about its contract incentives, investment amounts and production sharing \"may create a more successful image of Chinese companies than is actually the case.\" Frank A. Verrastro, an energy analyst for the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said oil purchases by national companies led by China and India are creating a \"new game for oil.\" He said hidden bilateral deals, including foreign aid to oil- selling countries, \"add a worrisome element\" to markets. Andrew J. Slaughter, a senior economist for Shell Oil Co., said two of three future market scenarios Shell is studying assume a drift from free-market practices, with increasing involvement by governments and more bilateral dealing. Assumptions oil-producing countries can provide enough surplus oil to balance the growing demands, he said, \"need reassessment.\"",
        "debiased_text": "A panel of energy experts provided testimony to the Senate Energy Committee regarding trends in global oil markets. Jeffrey Logan, an analyst from the International Energy Agency, stated that China's oil demand increased by 15% last year while domestic production grew slowly. According to Logan, China has surpassed Japan to become the world's second-largest oil importer after the U.S. He noted that China’s state-owned oil companies are securing future supply contracts in multiple countries, including Russia, Kazakhstan, Ecuador, Australia, and Saudi Arabia. Logan also mentioned that China does not disclose details about contract incentives, investment amounts, or production-sharing agreements, which could lead to discrepancies in assessing the actual performance of Chinese companies. Frank A. Verrastro of the Center for Strategic and International Studies observed that national oil companies, particularly those from China and India, are altering traditional market dynamics through bilateral deals, some of which include foreign aid to oil-producing countries. Andrew J. Slaughter, a senior economist at Shell Oil Co., reported that two out of three market scenarios Shell is evaluating involve reduced free-market practices, with increased government involvement and bilateral agreements. Slaughter added that assumptions about oil-producing nations maintaining sufficient surplus to meet rising demand may require reevaluation. Natural gas and crude-oil futures prices declined yesterday."
